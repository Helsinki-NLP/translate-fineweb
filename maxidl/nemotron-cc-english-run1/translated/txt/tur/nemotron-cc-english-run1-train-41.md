| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Kasım 2015<br/>Doksitrol tarafından yayınlandı<br/><br/>Bacopa, dünyanın dört bir yanındaki bataklık subtropikal ve tropikal bölgelerde yetişen çok yıllık bir bitkidir. Saygı duyulan bitki, bilişsel işlevi artıran bir besin takviyesi olan Doksitrol'de önemli bir bileşendir. Bacopa, beyni koruma ve sinir sisteminin bilgiyi iletmesini sağlayan biyokimyasal bir haberci olan asetilkolin'i artırma yeteneği için seçildi.<br/><br/>Ayurveda uygulayıcıları ilk olarak MÖ 300 yılında bacopa'nın terapötik özelliklerini tanımladılar. Hekimler bacopa'nın zeka ve hafızayı geliştirme yeteneklerini kaydettiler. Yaklaşık 2.500 yıl sonra, artan bir modern araştırma grubu, Ayurveda metninde kaydedilen bacopa'nın bilişsel faydalarını doğrulamaktadır.<br/><br/>1987'de Hindistan'daki araştırmacılar, bacopa'nın okul çağındaki çocukların entelektüel işlevi üzerindeki etkilerini değerlendirdi. Dört haftalık çalışma sırasında, 6 ila 8 yaşlarındaki 40 çocuğa bacopa uyguladılar. Bilim adamları bacopa'nın algı ve hafızayı artırdığını belirledi. Çocuklar bacopa aldıktan sonra labirent egzersizlerini daha hızlı ve daha doğru bir şekilde çözebildiler. Hindistan'daki birçok ebeveyn, çocuklarının entelektüel gelişimini geliştirmek için rutin olarak bacopa kullanır.<br/><br/>Ağustos 2001 tarihli Psikofarmakoloji dergisinde yayınlanan 12 haftalık bir çalışma, bakopanın bilişsel işlev üzerindeki etkilerini araştırdı. Bilim adamları, 18 ila 65 yaşları arasındaki sağlıklı gönüllüleri, bakopa veya inaktif bir madde almak için rastgele olarak görevlendirdi. Ayrıca, ürünlerin kimliklerini gizlemek için çalışma için çift kör bir yapılandırma kullandılar. Araştırmacılar, bu tasarımı, araştırmacılar ve katılımcılar tarafından önyargıyı ortadan kaldırdığı için test sonuçlarının geçerli olmasını sağlamak için kullanırlar. Bacopa grubu görsel bilgileri işleyebildikleri hızda önemli bir gelişme yaşadı. Katılımcılar ayrıca daha hızlı öğrendiler ve yeni anıları daha verimli bir şekilde depoladılar.<br/><br/>2007'de Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratuvar çalışması, bacopa'nın beyin sağlığını geliştirme yeteneğinden sorumlu mekanizmalardan birini ortaya çıkardı. Bilim insanlarına göre, bakopa oksidatif stresi ve sağlıklı beyin hücrelerine neden olduğu hasarı önlemek için polifenoller kullanır. Bacopa ayrıca, Alzheimer hastalığı olan hastaların beyinlerindeki plakın birincil bileşeni olan beta-amiloid olarak bilinen bir maddenin zararlı birikimlerini azaltır.<br/><br/>Alternatif ve Tamamlayıcı Tıp Dergisi'nin Temmuz 2008 sayısında yayınlanan çift kör bir çalışma, bacopa'nın yaşlı hastalar üzerindeki etkisini değerlendirdi. Çalışma, bacopa'nın stresi azaltırken bilişsel performansı artırdığını doğruladı. Yazarlara göre, bu çalışmada elde edilen faydalar daha önceki araştırmaların sonuçlarını doğruladı.<br/><br/>Phytotherapy Research dergisinin Aralık 2008 sayısında yayınlanan 90 günlük bir çalışma, daha önce diğer bakopa çalışmalarında gösterilen bilişsel faydaları doğrulamaktadır. Bacopa, katılımcıların karmaşık bir görevi tamamlamak için gerekli bilgileri geçici olarak depolama ve kullanma yeteneğini önemli ölçüde geliştirdi. Çift kör çalışma, bacopa'nın görsel bilgileri işlemek için gereken süreyi azalttığını da gösterdi.<br/><br/>Sinir sinyali iletimini arttırmanın yanı sıra, bilim adamları, bacopa'nın anksiyeteyi azaltarak bilişsel işlevi artırdığını teorize ediyorlar. Çok sayıda çalışma, anksiyetenin öğrenme ve ezberleme gibi daha üst düzey bilişsel işlevler gerektiren görevleri yerine getirme yeteneğine müdahale ettiğini göstermektedir. Stres biyokimyasal habercileri ve sağlıklı sinir sinyali iletimini bozar. Bacopa stresi hafifletir ve asetilkolin seviyelerini artırarak sakinlik hissini geri getirir, bu da kalp atış hızınızı azaltır ve daha derin nefes almanızı sağlar.<br/><br/>Doksitrol, bacopa'nın faydalarını elde etmenin harika bir yoludur. Bu bütünsel ek, beyin sağlığını teşvik eden ve karmaşık göreve odaklanma ve konsantre olma yeteneğinizi destekleyen diğer doğal bileşenleri de içerir ve bilgileri ezberler. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state. There's a lot weighing on her mind since she had to fight her birth family against her will and last time she saw them they all pretty much hated her. Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war.

Uzak bir hafızanın sesiydi, unutmaya başladığı ama umutsuzca aynı şekilde yapıştığı bir sesti. Kaybolan kızının üzüntüsünde bükülmüş annesinin sesiydi. Sonuçta Kagome iz bırakmadan sürgüne gönderildi. O anları, günün nasıl başladığını, kahvaltıda ne yediğini ve annesine söylediği son şeyi canlı bir şekilde hatırladı. O anılar, o anılar, çünkü başka bir zaman dünyalar arasında kaymış gibiydi. Uyanmıştı, listesizdi, çünkü okul dışında bir amacı yoktu. Bir iş bulabilirdi ve o gün bir röportaj için planlanmıştı. Kalbi bu işin içinde değildi ama yapması gereken buydu.<br/><br/>Korku hissini hatırladı, onu emdi ve kendine bunu yapabileceğine dair bir moral konuşması yaptı. Geçmişte her şeyin halledildiği şu anda olması gereken hayatta ilerleyebileceğini söyledi. Tabii ki, artık kendi zamanına ya da kendi hayatına ait olmadığı hissine kapılmıştı.<br/><br/>Kagome, parmaklarının altındaki ahşabın hissini, elinin kapıyı açmak için koluna kıvrıldığını hatırladı. Durduğunu, sersemlemesine kendini sallarken parlak ve canlı bir gülümsemeyle annesine döndüğünü hatırladı. "Çıkıyorum." Sesinin ne kadar güçlü olduğunu, gözleri gururla parlarken annesinin dudaklarındaki gülümsemeyi hatırladı. Annesi, öncekinden farklı görünmeyen ama her nasılsa sözlerin ağırlığı Kagome'nin omuzlarında daha ağır bir şekilde yerleşmiş olan vedasını daha fazla yansıttı.<br/><br/>Kısaca, düşünceler ileriye doğru titredi, annesinin onun için endişelenip endişelenmediğini merak ederek, onu olduğu gibi kaçırdı. Kagome, annesinin gücünün, kızının zaman içinde bu kadar sık kaydığı gerçeğine olan desteğinin açıkça itiraf edebilirdi. Bazı zamanlar, yaslanacak kadına sahip olmadığı için zayıf olduğunu düşünüyordu.<br/><br/>Bununla birlikte, az miktarda gücü bir araya getirdiğini hatırladı. Havadaki kaymayı, sıcaklığı özellikle beklediğinden farklı olarak, ani ve yabancı bir ortamda yanıp söndüğünü hatırlayabiliyordu. Ailesinin türbesi değildi. Ve geri dönmek için döndüğünde, içinden geçtiği kapıdan kaymak için, parmak uçlarının altında yabancı ve soğuk metal ve evinin girişi olmayan bir iç mekanla karşılaştı. Önünde bir adam duruyordu, bir tezgâhın arkasında, kendi gözleri kadar geniş bir bakışla ona bakıyordu.<br/><br/>En azından paniklemedi, zaman içinde parçalanıp imkansız durumlara yerleştirilmek en azından garip olaylar olduğu sürece iradeni inşa etti. Çünkü her gün biri kendisini bir iblis tarafından geçmişe sürüklenmiş olarak bulmadı, orada olduğunu bile bilmedikleri güçlü bir mücevheri vücudundan sökmeye niyetliydi. Ve sonra o kim bilir kaç parça içine güçlü mücevher parçaladı gerçeği vardı ve onları bulmak için görevlendirildi. Bu tür şeyler normal değildi, ve o onun gerçekliği olduğunu fark bir kez kare ve rulo gerekiyordu. Çok basit görünüyordu, sadece parçaları toplayın ve mücevheri düzeltin.<br/><br/>Ama kolay olmamıştı, parçalardan ve mücevherden sonra birçok iblis vardı. Ve özellikle güçlü bir iblis, yerine getirilmesini görmeye kararlıydı. Bu güne kadar dileğini hiç öğrenmemişti, ancak patlamayı tamamladığında bile hiç verilmediğini biliyordu. Hiçbir şey uğruna çok fazla hayatı mahvetti. Böyle boş bir görev için çok fazla hayatı mahvetti. Naraku en zor düşmandı ve arkadaşının tüm hayatında ters giden her şeyin merkezi olan kişiydi.<br/><br/>Ancak, bu öngörülemezlikti, olanlarla ve macerasından kazandığı irade gücüyle yuvarlanmak için gerekliydi, o anda çok kaprisli ya da uzak görünmeyen bir hikaye ortaya çıkarmak için çizdiğini hatırladı. İnanması gerekiyordu, hayatta kalması gerekiyordu.<br/><br/>Ne de olsa, kamera dükkanındaki bir adamdan daha kötü bir şekilde karşı karşıya geldi. Daha önce hayatını kurtarmak için dişlerinin arasından yalan söylemişti.<br/><br/>"Bir iş arıyordum." Sonunda, tam bir yalan değildi. Sonuçta, bir iş görüşmesine katılmak niyetiyle evinden çıkmıştı. Elbise durumu en azından bu kadarını doğrulardı. Söylediği en kolay fibslerden biriydi.<br/><br/>Ve nedense, o deli adam onu işe aldı.<br/><br/>#<br/><br/>Kagomed, uzak anıları geri iterken yatağında yuvarlandı, gerçekten uyanık olduğunu kabul etmeyi reddetti. Uykunun son anlarında tırmaladı, geri dönmesi ve onu kucaklaması için yalvardı. Gözlerini kapadı, gelmek için uyumaya istekliydi ve sadece anılarla karşılandı. Anılarının mesafesinde bir şarkının yankıları, ona sık sık işkence eden bir şarkı, onunla aynı adı verdi. Şarkı söyleyen ses artık annesini değil, büyürken sık sık çaldığı çocukların seslerini anımsatıyordu. Anıları geri çağırdılar, bu hayata başlayalı yıllar geçmesine rağmen, bu hayatta mutlu olmasına rağmen, bu anıların çağrısı çok yüksekti.<br/><br/>Aniden, onlara geri düşüyordu ve uyku tekrar ondan kaçtı. Inuyasha kuyuya geri çekilirken, ailesinin kucaklamasında kendini izliyordu, hissettiği kadar korkmuş görünüyordu. O anın anıları, bu duygular hala çok güçlüydü. Kalp kırıklığı ve üzüntü hissi, onun için önemli olan her şeyden koparılmış gibi hissettiğinden bu yana çok uzun zaman geçmesine rağmen tekrar iyileşti.<br/><br/>Tabii ki ailesi önemliydi ve tekrar kollarında olduğu için mutluydu. O günlerde nasıl hissettiğini asla tam olarak, gerçekten anlatamadı. Hala hem geçmişinde hem de şimdiki zamanda olmak için savaşan arzuları ile ikiye ayrıldığını nasıl hissettiğini açıklayamıyordu. Kuyudan atlamak için boşuna girişimleri, geri dönmesine izin vermek için çaresiz bir yalvarışla parmaklarını yere doğru tırmaladığını hatırladı. Evdeki ilk ay, ağladığı kadar uyuyamadı.<br/><br/>Elysion benzer bir tepkiyi garnitürlemişti, ancak o kadar şiddetli değildi, çünkü tam olarak nereye kaydığını bilmiyordu ve geri dönüş yolunu nerede kurcalayabileceğini bilmiyordu. Onun keşifleri işini çalışmak ve kendini bu hayata yerleştirmeye çalışmak arasında inceydi. Kalmak gibi bir niyeti yoktu, ihtiyaç duyduğundan daha uzun süre kalmak gibi bir niyeti yoktu. Ve geçmişe dönmeye çalışırken olduğu kadar şiddetli bir şekilde çabalamasa da, tutkusu on kattı çünkü bu dünyayla hiçbir bağı yoktu. Çünkü gerçekten yalnızdı... kimsenin ona ulaşma umudu yoktu.<br/><br/>Mantıksız anlarında, Jewel'in onu geri çektiğini ve içinde ikamet etmesi için yeni bir cehennem bulduğunu düşündü. Onu bir dilek tutmaya zorlayacak yeni bir cehennem, ancak sonsuza kadar gitmesini istediğini çok net bir şekilde hatırladı. Bu onun rüyalarını durdurmadı, gece hıçkırarak uyandığı zamanları ve geçmişinin o anılarıyla başa çıkılması en zor, unutulması en zor zamanlardı. Yine yatağında dönerken kalbi panik içinde koşmaya başladı, nefesi gecenin bu saatinde başıboş aklının neden olduğu panik atakla mücadele ederken bir mücadele haline geldi.<br/><br/>Çok zayıf, çok korkmuş hissetmekten nefret ediyordu.<br/><br/>#<br/><br/>Kagome sonunda kendini yataktan çekti, odası onu banyoya götürmeye yetecek soluk bir ışıkla yandı. Aynanın önünde durdu, yansımasına bakarken lavabo koşuyordu. Kuzgun renkli saçları yüzünü kapladı ve göründüğü kadar kötü hissetti. Elysion'daki ilk sabahı buna benziyordu, sadece daha kötü durumdaydı.<br/><br/>Uyumak için bir yer bulmuştu, binanın sahibi ile bir anlaşma yaparak, ödeme yapmadan küçük bir süre kalmasına izin vermişti. Belki de bu tür anlaşmalar yapmasına izin veren Miroku'nun etkisiydi, çünkü keşiş, insanların yaptıkları iş için yeterince fazlasını vermeleri için büyüleyici (veya dolandırıcılık) yollarıyla biliniyordu. Keşiş ilk tanıştıklarından beri her zaman böyleydi. Bir lordun konutunun olmadığı zaman perili olduğunu ya da olmayacakları zaman bir saldırıya maruz kaldıklarını iddia edecekti. Koğuşlarını ve cazibelerini bu kadar yüksek fiyatlara satacaktı. Neredeyse her seferinde işe yaradı ve insanların neden ona güvenmeye bu kadar istekli olduğunu merak etti.<br/><br/>Belki de onun gülümsemesi ya da geçmişin insanlarının parçalanmaya bu kadar istekli olduğu gerçeğiydi. En azından zayıfları avlamadı. Her zaman doğru olanı yaptı ve doğru olanı yapmak için her şeyi zorladığı zamanlarda ona bir güç sembolü oldu. Ölmek üzere olduğunu, lanetlendiğini ve kaderinde bocalamak yerine bu konuda bir şeyler yapmaya çalıştığını ileri sürdü. Son kavgalarına kadar giden zamanda kendini sınıra kadar itmişti. Ve Naraku'yu, babası ve ondan önceki babasıyla aynı kadere tabi olmadan önce yendikleri için sevinmişti.<br/><br/>Ancak kendi cazibeleri gittiği sürece, arkadaşından daha adildi ve anlaşmayı makul hale getirdi. Bu dünyadaki herhangi birinin bir şeytan çıkarma veya şeytanları kovmak için ağır bir bedel ödeyeceğinden şüphelendi. Bunun için teknolojik olarak çok gelişmişlerdi. Ama iyi bir anlaşma yapacak kadar zeki ve zekiydi.<br/><br/>Ama şimdi, Kagome daha iyi bir yerdeydi ama yüzündeki ifade aynı görünüyordu. Perili, yorgun, boşaltılmış...<br/><br/>Duvardaki bir saate hızlı bir bakış, ona daha uzun süre uyumaya çalışabileceğini söyledi. Ama geri dönüşlerle tekrar yüzleşmek istemeyerek bundan vazgeçti. Bunun yerine bir duş aldı, soğuk suyu kullanarak şeytanlarını kovaladı, ciğerlerini keskin bir nefes alımıyla doldurdu ve kendini uyandırmaya zorladı.<br/><br/>#<br/><br/>İşe yaramadı.<br/><br/>İstediği şekilde değil. Soğuk su kesinlikle havayı akciğerlerine zorladı, aklını uyandırmaya ve kasları ele geçirmeye zorladı. Başını geriye eğip kendini daha fazla hatırladığını bulurken dudaklarından acı bir kahkaha çekildi. Bugün, onlardan bu kadar kolay kaçamayacaktı. Bu kadar basit bir şekilde iyileşmeyecekti, sırf istediği için iyileşecekti.<br/><br/>Bazen, istediğin düşüncelerden kaçmak olmaz, onları aştığından emin olsan bile.<br/><br/>Sango bu durumda büyük bir yardım olurdu. iblis avcısı onun en iyi arkadaşıydı, o bile ona hiç sahip olmadığı kız kardeşi diyecek kadar ileri giderdi. bilge bir abla, sorun ortaya çıktığında her zaman onun tarafını vardı. Özellikle erkek sorunu, bu tür şeyler oldukça önemsizken ama bir aşk yaşamak ve Inuyasha onu üzdüğünde arkadaşının onun adına kızması eğlenceliydi. Ne de olsa, çoğu zaman yarı iblis, ölü sevgilisinin yanına koşar ve kalbini birden fazla kez kırardı.<br/><br/>Ama Sango ona başka yönlerden de ilham verdi. Kadının karşılaştığı onca şeyden sonra, her zaman çok güçlü, çok emindi... Kendinden şüphe ettiği zamanlarda bile, her zaman üstesinden geldi. Tüm ailesini kaybettikten sonra hayatta kalma yeteneğine sahip olduğunu takdir etti - bunun hatırlatıcısı Kagome'yi hayatta kalmaya zorladı, çünkü herkesi bu dünyaya kaybetti - ve sonra kardeşinin Naraku'nun bir piyonu olmasını sağladı. Kolay değildi, sadece herkesin yüzleşebileceği ve hala ileriye gidebileceği bir şey olamazdı. Hala gülümsedi, o acı ve o hatırlatıcılarla bile... Çoğu zaman çok parlaktı, karanlık zamanlarda bile.<br/><br/>Ve şu anda, yaşlı kadının tarafına yaslanmak, orada olduğu ve destekleyici olduğu gerçeğini rahatlatmak istedi. Sango'nun bir şekilde bunu başaracağını ve bazı güç ve anlayış kelimeleri sunacağını hissetti. Bu büyüleri daha da kötüleştiren, sürekli ailesinin olmadığını hatırlatan böyle zamanlar oldu.<br/><br/>"Yalnız kalmak istemiyorum." Yalnızlığında yüksek sesle bağırdı, duşun sesi yalvarışı boğdu.<br/><br/>İtiraf etmekten çekinmedi.<br/><br/>#<br/><br/>Farkına varmadan başka bir saat daha geçmişti. Derisi sudan soğuktu ve damarlarında buz varmış gibi hissediyordu. Eli suyu kapatmak ve duşunu bitirmek için ulaşana kadar titremeye başladığını fark etmemişti. Kagome yine aynada kendi bakışını aramıyordu, bunun yerine kendini havluya sarıp banyodan, merdivenlerden yukarı ve mutfağına girdi. Hafif bir kahvaltı yapmaya başladı, yemek pişirilirken gün boyunca notlarını boş boş okudu.<br/><br/>Kariyeri gerçekten bu son yıllarda çıkıyordu. Fotoğrafları birçok galeride yer aldı, adı fotoğrafçılıkla ilgilenenler için sık sık birçok dudak kullanmaya başladı.<br/><br/>Bir hevesle istediği iş her şeyi tetiklemişti. Bu dünyada olmasını beklediğinden çok daha şanslıydı. Çatlaklardan kendi dünyasına kayacak kadar şanslı değildi, ama iyi yapacak kadar şanslıydı. Sobaya geri dönerken, sonunda eve dönmekten vazgeçtiği zamanı hatırladı. Burada hayatında yaklaşık iki yıl geçti, çünkü fotoğrafa sadece bir hobiden daha fazlası olarak girmeye başlamıştı, ancak kendisi için bir isim yapabilirdi.<br/><br/>O gün özellikle hoştu, güneş gökyüzünde yüksekti ve kendini doğal manzaranın bazı fotoğraflarını çekerken bulmuştu. Küçük bir çocuk bitkilerden birine saklanmıştı ve o, avını ürkütmek için atladığı andan önce yüzünün neşeli, yaramaz bir sırıtışın içine yerleştiği anın bir resmini yakalamıştı. Bu ona Shippou'yu hatırlattı, sahip olduğu küçük kitsune, esasen, evlat edindi. O da, ilk tanıştıklarında ailesinden koparılmıştı. Babası öldürdü ve intikamını almaya kararlıydı. Gençken, ilk karşılaşmalarında çok olgun görünüyordu.<br/><br/>Belki de kitin tekrar bir çocuk gibi davranmasına, zaman zaman genç ve kaprisli olmasına izin veren Inuyasha'nın etkisiydi, diğerleri ise daha olgundu. Ona kendi tarzında rahatlık sundu ve o zamanlar çok genç olmasına rağmen ona kendisi gibi bakmaya çalıştı. Bununla birlikte, gençliği ona nasıl bakacağını veya çocuğu gibi ona nasıl bakacağını anlamasına engel olmadı. Gülümsediğinde, boya kalemleri hediyesinden çok mutlu olduğunda ve sanat yapmak için zaman ayırdığında kalbi kabardı. Bitirdiği her çizimle o kadar gurur duyuyordu ki, bir annenin böyle bir durumda nasıl hissedeceğini biliyordu.<br/><br/>Onu parçalayan acı çok fazla, çok ani oldu. Onu özlemiş ve gittiğinden beri ne kadar büyüdüğünü görmek istemiş. Çok şey özlemişti...<br/><br/>Kendini daha fazla acıdan, yanlış umutlardan korumak için vazgeçti ve kendini geliştirmeye odaklandı.<br/><br/>#<br/><br/>Kahvaltı tatsız, sıkıcı ve ilham vericiydi. Sadece bitirdikten sonra, yiyeceklerin her türlü baharatını veya lezzetini unuttuğunu fark etti. Bu kadarını hatırlamak için artık çok geçti, çünkü zihni, açıkça yemeklerinden daha önemli hale gelmiş olan hayatının diğer ayrıntılarını hatırlamakla meşguldü.<br/><br/>"Otur!"<br/><br/>Tabii ki, ona yarı iblisi hatırlatan özellikle sinir bozucu bir müşteriye öfkeyle bağırdığında hiçbir şey olmadı. Özellikle inatçı ve kaba davranıyordu, doğal olarak çalışmasına izin vermek yerine bir fotoğrafın çekilmesini istiyordu. Vahşi hayvanları istediğiniz gibi davranmaya zorlayabilirsiniz. Ama nadiren herkes güçle başarılı oldu. Inuyasha o kadar da kötü değildi. Inuyasha ondan zorla uzaklaştırılmadan önce öğrenmişti. Daha nazik, daha anlayışlı, daha olgun olmuştu, ancak hala çocuksu ve ukala olduğu zamanlar vardı.<br/><br/>Yanaklarının ne kadar kırmızı yandığını, ancak zeminini nasıl durduğunu ve onu nasıl kovduğunu hatırlıyor. Ona, doğasının ötesinde, kendi arzularının ötesinde bir şeyi çarpıtmak isteyen herhangi biri için veya herhangi biriyle çalışmayı reddettiğini söyledi.<br/><br/>Inuyasha'dan ziyade adamı Naraku ile karşılaştırmalıydı. Müvekkilinin böyle aşırı niyetleri olmamasına rağmen. En azından daha sonra hissedilen hoş bir anıydı. Yapmak istemediği işi reddedebilecek kadar ileri gittiğini bilme özgürlüğü, başkalarından bağımsız olan kendi kişisi olmak. O noktada başardığını söyleyebilirdi. Günler sonra ona iftira atmak için kelimelerle dedikodular duymasına rağmen.<br/><br/>Yolculuğunun sonuna doğru yaptığı gibi kendini haklı olarak savundu. Sonuçta, bu dünyada kendini koruyabilecek tek kişiydi.<br/><br/>#<br/><br/>Sabah ışığı evine sürünmeye başladı, ona zamanın geçişini tekrar hatırlattı. Yine, yapması gereken şeylerin listesini düşündü ve nereden başlayacağı konusunda tartıştı. Ya da hiç başlamalı mı? Günün nasıl başladığıyla, bunun harika bir fikir olduğunu düşünüp düşünemeyeceğini bilmiyordu. Kendinde ne kadar kaybolduğu konusunda başarılı olacağı şüpheliydi.<br/><br/>Son çalışmalarını mahvetmek istemedi. Çünkü bunu daha önce birkaç kez yapmıştı. Tam bir felaketten kurtulmaya çalışmak hoş değildi.<br/><br/>Kagome, pahalı, yepyeni, kamerasının elinden kayıp gittiğini hatırladı. Bunu desteklemeye hazır değildi, çünkü çantasından yeni çıkarmıştı. Bir kısmı içeriden çığlık attı. Dramatik, üst üste gelen, çok daha gençken sık sık yaptığı çığlıklarla dolu. Zamanlar arasında atlarken orta okulu geçmek için mücadele ederken. Lensi tamamen parçalanırken ve kameranın geri kalanı da onunla birlikte kırılırken diğer kısmı yerinde donmuş olarak kalmıştı.<br/><br/>Tam bir iblis olan Inuyasha'nın ağabeyini görmek, onun fotoğrafları için yola çıktığında beklediği en son şeydi. Her zamanki gibi, her zamanki gibi, hatırladığı kadar heybetli durdu. Aklını okumakta hiçbir zaman en iyi olmadığı halde tamamen farklı bir dünyada olmak için hayal kırıklığına uğramış gibi görünmüyordu. Dudaklarındaki adı o kadar güçlüydü ki, en küçük duygularını bile hatırlayabiliyordu. Dudakları çatladı, ağzı kurudu ve midesindeki kabarcıklı endişe hissi onu hasta hissettirdi.<br/><br/>Umutlarının kalkmasını istemiyordu.<br/><br/>Ama, arkadaş olmasalar bile, onun orada olmasını istedi. Yan yana savaştıkları için müttefiklerdi, eğer bir şey varsa. Ve bir şey kesinlikle hiçbir şeyden daha iyiydi.<br/><br/>Ve Kagome, yalnız olmadığını bilerek kollarını onun etrafına saracak kadar ona kendini atmayacaktı. Kamerası ona yaklaştığında artık önemli değildi. Günlerce onunla zaman geçirirken hiçbir şeyin önemli olmadığını hatırladı, dünyalarından söz etmiyor, konuşuyorlardı (ya da konuşuyordu ve o sadece bu gerçeği kabul ediyordu).<br/><br/>Tam olarak ona aşık olduğu zaman Kagome hatırlayamıyordu, tıpkı onun gibi incelikli bir şeydi, ama o hissin orada olduğunu biliyordu ve ona düştüğünü, hislerin bir şekilde çiçek açtığını bilmesini sağladı.<br/><br/>#<br/><br/>Bir ağırlıksızlık hissi onu ele geçirdi ve aniden gözleri açıldı, zihni yaptığı son şey için umutsuzca pençelendi. Kanepesinde ne zaman uyuduğunu hatırlamıyordu, ancak en son bulunduğu yerin çok rahat minderlerde olduğunu biliyordu. Bununla birlikte, tanıdık kollarda olduğu gibi mücadele etmedi veya ağırlıksızlıkla mücadele etmedi. Başı Sesshoumaru'nun göğsüne eğildi, burada olduğu ve yalnız olmadığı gerçeğiyle rahatladı.<br/><br/>"Hoşgeldin." Cevabı, kabulde yumuşak bir uğultuydu. Niyetini anlamak için çok fazla konuşmasına gerek yoktu, ya da söyleyeceklerinin geri kalanı.<br/><br/>Onu yatağına geri taşıdı, kolaylıkla içine yerleştirdi. Gözleri onunkiyle tanıştı ve kolayca gülümsedi çünkü artık hatıralar geri sürüklenmedi, ona daha fazla hatıra alay etmedi. Hayır, ne zaman yakın olsa, bu düşüncelere asla geri dönmedi. O yardım etmişti, ve yıllar yardım etmişti. Bugün sadece... o günlerden biriydi.<br/><br/>"Uyku." Kolaylıkla emir verdi, gözleri ona döndü ama yorgun olduğu için kavga etmedi. Eli ona sıkıca sarıldı, oysa sağlığının değerlendirilmesinde alnına karşı el basını hissetti.<br/><br/>"Ben iyiyim," dedi sözleri, sözüyle sağlamlaştı.<br/><br/>İyiydi, yaşıyordu ve mutluydu.<br/><br/>#<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>özet<br/><br/>Kagome, hayatının bir noktasında, ailesinin kuyu evinde bir iblis tarafından saldırıya uğrayana kadar oldukça düzenli bir genç kızdı. İblis onu yaklaşık 500 yıl geçmişe büyüyle taşıyan kuyuya sürükledi. Orada, içine sürüklendiği zamandan 50 yıl önce ölmüş bir rahibenin reenkarnasyonu olduğu için vücudunun içinde kutsal bir mücevherin kaplandığını öğrendi. Mücevher vücudundan söküldü ve onu zamanda sürükleyen iblis, ağaca tutturulmuş olan serbest bıraktığı yarı iblis tarafından mağlup edildi. Kagome, yarı iblis Inuyasha ile zaman içinde arkadaş oldu ve kendisinin parçaladığı mücevheri geri getirmek için onunla birlikte seyahat etti. Birçok iblis ve insanın mücevheri kendi amaçları için aradığı kadar basit ve kolay olmasa da. Genç bir kitsune iblisi, bir keşiş ve mücevheri geri getirmek için onunla birlikte seyahat eden bir iblis avcısı ile arkadaş oldu.<br/><br/>Ancak grubu, mücevheri tamamlayan kişi değildi. Bunun yerine, yoldaşının hayatının çoğunda büyük olayların çoğunu manipüle eden kötü bir yarı iblis. Sonunda mücevherin tüm parçalarını topladığında ve dileğini lekeli nesneye yaptığında, Kagome, mücevheri sonsuza dek içeride tutmak için bencil bir dilekte bulunmak niyetiyle mücevherin içine çekildi. Onu karanlıktan kurtarmayı başaran Inuyasha'nın inatçılığıydı. Sonunda, doğal zamanına geri döndü, zaman çizelgesinin bir kızından beklendiği gibi liseyi bitirdi. Günler sonra Kagome, Elysion'da sona erdi. Beş yıldır bu dünyadadır ve uzun zamandır eve dönmekten vazgeçmiştir. Yeni hayatına mutlu bir şekilde yerleşmiştir.<br/><br/>platonik<br/><br/>Kagome'nin yeni arkadaşlar edinmesi oldukça kolaydır, gençliğinden çok fazla değişmemiştir. Hayatında en çok empatik ve misafirperver olan neşeli genç bir kadındır. Gençliğinde, çoğu onlardan korktuğunda şeytanlarla arkadaş oldu. Eskiden insanları yiyen iblisler bile arkadaş oldu ve yollarını değiştirdi (düşünmek istiyor). Bununla birlikte, birisi fidye almaya istekli olduğunu veya tamamen kötü olmadığını gösterdiği sürece onun arkadaşı olmak gerçekten kolaydır.

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Neden Twitter'da Olmalısınız<br/><br/>Feragatname: Sosyal medya gurusu olduğumu iddia etmiyorum ve hiç iddia etmedim. Ben sadece çok şey düşünen bir insanım ve bu birkaç kez gündeme geldi.<br/><br/>Ben erken evlat edinen biri değilim. Bazen bir şeyi ne için kullanmak istediğimi anlamam yıllar alır ve Twitter da bunlardan biriydi. Twitter'da bu yılın Şubat ayından beri ciddi bir şekilde bulunuyorum, bu yüzden bu konuda oldukça yeniyim. Yine de, birkaç şey öğrendim ve paylaşmak istedim. Bazı insanlar benim bir Twitter iticisi olduğumu söylüyor ve öyleyim, çünkü bu işe girmek için birçok iyi neden var ve neredeyse hiçbir olumsuzluk yok.<br/><br/>Peki Twitter nedir? İnternetteyseniz, muhtemelen en azından duymuşsunuzdur. Facebook veya LinkedIn gibi bir şeyden daha halka açık bir ortamda sohbetler, güncellemeler ve haberler için bir forum olarak hizmet veren bir sosyal medya ağıdır. Facebook sizi kimin bulmak istediğiyle ilgilidir, ancak Twitter kimi bulmak istediğinizle ilgilidir. En sevdiğiniz yazarlar, aktörler, politikacılar, şarkıcılar ve bilim adamları muhtemelen Twitter'da. En sevdiğiniz yardım kuruluşları, radyo istasyonları, haber siteleri ve mağazalar da öyle. Ve onları bulmanı ve söyleyeceklerini dinlemeni istiyorlar. Twitter'daki herkes, en azından başlangıçta, seninle konuşmak istiyor.<br/><br/>Ama neden buna katılıyorsunuz? Neden bunun bir parçası olun? Her türlü neden var ve size birkaç tane vereceğim.<br/><br/>İnsanlar ve Yerler Twitter, dünya çapında, aynı zamanda topluluğunuzda olup biten olayları öğrenmek için harika bir yoldur. Seyahat ediyorsanız ve yapacak şeyler arıyorsanız, ilgi alanlarınızla ilgili şeyleri öğrenmek için harika bir yoldur (çünkü takip ettiğiniz insanlar ilgilendiğiniz insanlardır). Seyahat etmeseniz bile, yerel olarak gidilecek harika yerleri bilmek veya ilgilendiğiniz kişilerin onlara gittiğini bilmek, onlarla tanışmak ve onlarla daha derin bir ilişki kurmak için bir fırsat yaratır. Parti yazıma geri dönerseniz, içindeki iki kişi hariç, Twitter'da duydum ve sonra gerçek hayatta tanıştım ve şimdi oldukça iyi arkadaşız. Ve bunu ne kadar çok yaparsanız, o kadar çok şey öğrenirsiniz ve o kadar çok insanla tanışırsınız. Ve Twitter'da onları takip ederseniz, zaten nasıl oldukları hakkında biraz bilginiz var. Bunu istiyorlar. Bunun tersi de doğrudur, çünkü tweet atmak insanları sizin nasıl olduğunuzu görmeye davet eder ve sizin için aynı seçimleri yapabilirler.<br/><br/>İlham ve Motivasyon<br/>İlham en garip yerlerden geliyor ve tweetlerin akması hayal gücünüz için her zaman taze içerik olduğu anlamına geliyor. Takip eden bir ilk politikam var, bu yüzden hemen hemen herkesi takip edeceğim ve ardından periyodik olarak insanları takip edip takip etmeyi bırakacağım. Yeni bir blog yazısının veya yeni bir projenin tohumunu kim ekecek bilmiyorum, bu yüzden seçeneklerimi açık tutmayı seviyorum. Motivasyon da olur, çünkü Twitter tıpkı hayat gibidir. Kendinizi hırslı, kendini adamış, cömert ve çalışkan insanlarla çevrelerseniz, böyle olmak ve kendinizi zorlamak daha kolaydır. Olayları planlayabiliyorlarsa, projeler başlatabiliyorlarsa ya da sadece sabah kalkabiliyorlarsa, siz de yapabilirsiniz diye düşünmek daha kolay.<br/><br/>Öğrenme ve Yaşam Tarzı Blogcular Twitter'da. Aslında olmayan blogcular çılgın olabilir. Ve insanlar hemen hemen her şey hakkında blog yazıyorlar. Bir şey öğrenmek istiyorsanız, birisinin bu konuda tweet atma olasılığı iyidir. Bunun da ötesinde, haber servisleri ve mağazalar da birbirine bağlıdır, bu da haberlerinizi dakikaya kadar alabileceğiniz ve başlarken satış ve fırsatlar hakkında bilgi alabileceğiniz anlamına gelir. Yaşam tarzına gelince, yeni tarif fikirleri mi arıyorsunuz? Bazı yemek servislerini takip edin ve ne bulduklarını görün. Kokteyl partisi için bir bükülmeye mi ihtiyacınız var? Twitter'ın bunun için de insanları var. Gardırop önerileri, ya da sadece diğer insanların hayatlarıyla ne yaptığını görmek ister misiniz? Hepsi orada.<br/><br/>Bu konuda konuşurken karşılaştığım bazı ortak zorluklar var ve bunlar meşru engeller. Özellikle de benim yaptığım gibi geç saatlerde bandoya biniyorsanız, oldukça yıldırıcı görünebilir. Sadece iki kişiyi takip ederek ve başka ne yapacağımı bilmeden aylar geçirdim. Ancak bunların üstesinden gelmenin ve en az sıklıktan en çok duyduklarını duymanın yolları var.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter Narsisistik Jerks içindir<br/>Bence bu, çoğu insanın dikkat çekmenin bir yolu olarak kendileri için ve kendileri hakkında tweet attığı fikrinden geliyor. Anlamadığım şey, bunun neden yanlış bir şey olduğu ya da bunu yapmanın neden bir narsist ya da bir pislik haline geldiği. Birisinin söyleyecek bir şeyi varsa, duyulmak isterler. Eskiden sokak köşesinde durup bağırırdınız. Şimdi 140 karakter veya daha az bağırabilirsiniz. Twitter sadece yeni bir duyulacak yol. Şimdi, Twitter'da kesinlikle narsist pislikler var. Neredeyse her yerdeler. Bazen insanlar pisliktir. Bazen o insanlardan biri benim, üzgünüm. O insanları takip etme. Birisinin söylediklerini beğenmiyorsanız, yaptıkları puanlar veya banyo aktivitelerinin ayrıntılı hesapları olsun, Twitter'da dinlemek zorunda değilsiniz.<br/><br/>#2: Hepsinin İzini Tutamıyorum<br/>İnsanların sık sık gündeme getirdiği ikinci engel, Twitter'da olup bitenleri takip etmek için zamanları olmamasıdır. Ve biliyor musun? Bu iyi. Neler yapabileceğinizi takip edin. Belki sadece birkaç günde bir dolaşıyorsunuzdur. Özel bir kullanıcıysanız (şirketiniz için tweet atmak yerine) ve özellikle de yeni başlayan biriyseniz, sorun değil. Bir şeyin parçası hiçbir şeyden daha iyidir.<br/><br/># 1 Orada koymak istediğim hiçbir şey yok<br/>Bu, insanların en sık karşılaştığı zorluktur. Ve fark etmez. Konuşmak için Twitter'a katılmak zorunda değilsiniz. Dinlemek için katılın. Yine en sevdiğiniz yazarlar, şarkıcılar, blogcular ve gazeteler burada. Bu onları dinlemek için bir şans. Hayatlarına ve etkinliklerine bir pencere kazanmak için bir şans, ve bunu yapmak için davet ediyorlar. San Diego Comic Con'da Felicia Günü'nün ne olacağını öğrenmek ister misin? Bitti. Sadece Twitter'da dinleyen insanları tanıyorum ve bu harika. Bir süre bunu yaptım. Sonunda, belki tweet atacak bir şey bulacaksın ya da tweet atacak bir şey yapacaksın. Umarım yaparsın, çünkü bunu duymak istiyorum.<br/><br/>Kısacası, Twitter kullanmıyorsanız, bence yapmalısınız. Eğer tam anlamıyla kullanmıyorsanız, yapmaya çalışın. Tüm bu insanlar ilgilendiğiniz şeyleri söylüyorsa, beş yüz kişiyi takip etmekten korkmayın. Bu insanları hayatınızın bir parçasına davet edin ve etkileşimle nasıl geliştiğini görün. Sizden haber almayı dört gözle bekliyorum. |
| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Kök Kanallar<br/><br/>Bir kök kanal alma düşüncesi çoğu insanı kenara koyar. SCM Dental, bir kök kanalını neredeyse ağrısız ve düşük stresli bir prosedür haline getirmek için en son teknolojiyi ve tekniği kullanır.<br/><br/>Döner endodonti, endodontik tedaviyi gerçekleştirmek için ileri bir teknoloji ve tekniktir, bir kök kanalının klinik terimi "kök kanalı" terimi, dişin merkezindeki doğal boşluğu ifade eder. Dişin siniri, kök kanalının içindeki yumuşak dokuda (pulp) bulunur. Diş travma veya çürümeden zarar görürse, döküntüler hassas kök kanalı bölgesine girebilir ve bir enfeksiyona veya aşırı durumlarda ve apseye neden olabilir. Apse olmuş bir diş çok ciddidir ve vücudun diğer bölgelerine yayılabilecek bir enfeksiyon oluşturabileceğinden acil bir durum olarak tedavi edilmelidir. Apse olmuş bir dişiniz olduğuna inanıyorsanız, acil durum bakımını planlamak için derhal ofisimize başvurun.<br/><br/>Duruma bağlı olarak, kök kanal tedavisi birden fazla ziyaret gerektirebilir. Diş ve kök kanalını değerlendirmek ve varsa hasarın ve enfeksiyonun boyutunu belirlemek için bir başlangıç röntgeni alınacaktır. Rahatlamanız için size bir anestezi şekli verilecektir.<br/><br/>Bölge uyuştuğunda, diş hekimimiz elektrikli bir el aleti kullanarak kök kanalına bir erişim odası oluşturacaktır. Daha sonra, kök kanalı enfekte olmuş veya hasar görmüş doku ve sinirlerden kazınacaktır. Tüm alan temizlendikten ve cilalandıktan sonra, diş gutta percha adı verilen biyouyumlu bir kauçuk bileşikle doldurulur. Diş daha sonra mukavemet ve işlevi geri getirmek için bir diş dolgusu veya diş tacı ile kaplanır.<br/><br/>Endodontik tedavi, ağrılı bir prosedür olarak kötü bir üne sahiptir. Döner endodontiklerde, bir kök kanal prosedürü, bir diş dolgusunun yerleştirilmesinden daha acı verici değildir. Sinire enfeksiyon ve hasar, aşırı ağrı ve rahatsızlık yaratan şeydir ve kök kanal tedavisi gördükten sonra önemli bir rahatlama yaşayacaksınız hastalardır. Kök kanalları %95 başarı oranına sahiptir ve insanların doğal dişlerini korumalarını sağlar. |
| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Churchyard Alt Ahşap<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate yakınındaki oteller<br/><br/>Şimdi adı Queen's Wood.<br/><br/>1860 ve 1880 yılları arasında merkez kanalizasyon, demiryolları ve yeni yollar inşa etmek için Londra şehrinden söküldü. Evler, başka bir yerde bulabildikleri her türlü konaklama yerini bulmak zorunda kalan kiracıları dikkate almadan yıkıldı. Yöneticiler Kensington ve St. John's Wood'daki Livo'ya giderlerken, en fakirleri Seven Dials ve Lisson Grove gibi Rookeries'e kalabalıktı. Aradakiler için, kâtipler ve yetenekli işçiler, spekülatif inşaatçılar teraslı villaların sırasını sıraya dizdiler ve Bay Pooter Holloway'e taşındı. Muswell Hill halkı, Crouch Hill ve diğer tarafta Finsbury Park'ın tarlalarında sürünen evleri izledi, böylece 1880'e kadar Crouch End geliştiriliyor ve akışı durdurmanın bir yolu görünmüyordu. On yıl sonra Muswell Hill'in büyük mülkleri satılıyordu. Upton Çiftliği satıldı ve Ecclesiastical Commissioners, şimdi Queen's Wood olarak adlandırılan Churchyard Bottom Wood'u geliştirmek istedi. Hikaye bir Ibsen oyunu yapacaktı. İki grup dürüst, yüksek motivasyonlu insanlar, her birinin doğru olduğunu düşündükleri şey için savaşıyorlar. Bir yanda Ecclesiastical Commissioners ve diğer yanda Hornsey Charities Komitesi, her ikisi de diğer insanlar için ellerinden gelenin en iyisini yaptıklarına inanıyordu ve halk onlara karşı öfkelendi.<br/><br/>O zamanlar Muswell Hill Yolu bir taşra yoluydu, bir ucunda Southwood Hall ve diğer ucunda Upton Çiftliği vardı. 1894 yılına gelindiğinde, Onslow Bahçeleri inşa edildi, Connaught Bahçeleri işaretlendi ve inşaatçılar Woodlands arazisini geliştirmeye hazırdı. Churchyard Bottom Wood'u kesmek, üçgen bir sitede devrilen bir grup kulübeydi. Ecclesiastical Commissioners tarafından tutulan tarihsiz bir harita, aralarında bir açıklık olan altı Wasteland Cottages'ı gösteriyor - bir yol değil, metal değil, arkasındaki çilek yataklarına giden bir yol. Daha sonra ahşaptan patikalara yol açan başka bir boşluk vardı. Bu iki açıklık planın temeli olacaktı. Aynı iki boşluk ve çilek tarlası olan temizlenmiş zemin, aşağıdaki 1894 haritasında görülebilir. Onlar 'Muswell Hill Cottages' olarak gösterilir ve oldukça geçerken, Peter Sellers çok daha sonra aynı sitede yaşayacaktı. Ormanı bir konut arazisi olarak geliştirmek için, Komiserlerin Muswell Hill Yolu'ndan iki yol geçmesi ve yanlarında evler inşa etmeleri gerekiyordu. Muswell Hill Road cephesi tek başına, girişimi değerli kılacak yeterli ev için yer sağlamayacaktı.<br/><br/>Arazi ve kır evleri, yaşlı insanları barındırmak için çok daha önce sadaka evleri olarak verilmişti ve Hornsey Yardım Komiserleri Mütevelli Heyeti tarafından onlar adına tutuldu. 1890'lara gelindiğinde, büyük onarıma ihtiyaç duyan evler yıkıldı. Kamu ruhlu, eski kiracıları için en iyisini yapmak isteyen Mütevelli, paraları olmadığı için onları iyileştiremedi. Ecclesiastical Commissioners, Gravel Pit Wood'u (şimdi Highgate Wood) bir konut olarak geliştirmeyi planlamadan birkaç yıl önce, ancak bu, geri adım attıkları kadar muhalefetle karşılaşmıştı. Bunun yerine, 1886'da, 69 dönümlük ormanlık arazinin tamamını halka verdiler. Aynı zamanda Churchyard Bottom Wood'u Hornsey Kentsel Bölge Konseyi'ne 25.000 sterline satmayı teklif ettiler, ancak bu Hornsey'in kendi başına yetiştiremeyeceği kadar fazlaydı. Konsey, Hornsey dışında yaşayan insanların da tahtadan zevk aldığını ve diğer yetkililerin yardım etmesi gerektiğini, ancak yardımın verilmediğini söyledi. Sonunda teklif itaate düştü.<br/><br/>Tartışmanın merkezi olan Muswell Hill Cottages'ı gösteren harita.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Yolu yaklaşık 1880<br/><br/>Bu üç çift kulübenin anlaşmazlığın merkezinde yer alanlar olması muhtemel görünüyor.<br/><br/>Ecclesiastical Commissioners, İngiltere'deki ve yurtdışındaki kilise çalışmaları için para toplamak istedi. Kendilerine dinin propogat iyonu için kullanılacak toprakların verildiğini ve bunun toprak veya orman satışı anlamına geldiğini düşündüler, bu kilisenin çalışmasını kısıtlamaktan daha az bir kötülüktü. Gravel Pit Wood'u halka vermişlerdi: onun yerine Churchyard Bottom Wood'u geliştireceklerdi.<br/><br/>Hornsey Charities Mütevelli Heyeti, yoksul halkına yardım etmek için bir gelir elde etmek istedi, bu yüzden Komiserlere bir teklifte bulundular. Üçgen arazileri ekonomik olarak geliştirilemeyecek kadar garip bir şekilde şekillendirilmişti, ancak Komiserler onlara kare bir alana girebilmeleri için biraz daha arazi verirlerse, yirmi beş düzgün villa inşa ederlerdi. Bunlar, Hornsey halkının yoksulluğunu gidermek için kullanılabilecek yıllık 225 sterlinlik toprak kiraları getirecekti. Buna karşılık Komisyon erlerinin arazilerinde iki yol kesmelerine izin vereceklerdi, böylece Komisyon üyeleri ormanı geliştirebileceklerdi.<br/><br/>Bu teklif tanındığında insanlar hemen alarmla tepki gösterdiler.<br/><br/>16 Aralık 1893'te Bay Carvell Williams Milletvekili Avam Kamarası'nda Ecclesiastical Commissioners'ın Hornsey Charities Mütevelli Heyeti'ne mevcut bir yolun 40 feet'e genişletilmesi şartıyla bir arazi şeridini satmaya razı olup olmadığını, bunun bir inşaat şemasının ön hazırlığı olup olmadığını ve Parlamento Meclisi'nin bir görüşü ifade etme fırsatı olup olmadığını sordu.<br/><br/>Bay Leveson Gower, bir Kilise Mülkleri Komiseri "Evet" diye cevap verdi.<br/><br/>Bay Carvell Williams, "Highgate Woods'un o kısmını üzerine inşa ederek yok etme niyetini anlıyor muyum?"<br/><br/>İki gün sonra The Star, herhangi bir modern magazin dergisine layık bir makale yayınladı.<br/><br/>Yıldız<br/>18 Aralık 1893<br/><br/>'Parlamento, o eski vandalları ve jerry-inşaatçısı Ecclesiastical Commissioners'ın konfederasyonlarını yakından izlemeli. Her zaman bir parça toprağı yabancılaştırıyorlar ya da genel halkın aksine inşaatçıları tercih ediyorlar. Komisyon üyeleri, Churchyard Bottom ağacını ücret ödeyenlere satmaz, ancak şimdi çok sayıdaki bina şemasından biriyle bağlantılı olarak içinden iki geniş yol keserek 'açmayı' teklif eder. Parlamentoda kimse soru sormaz mı ve komisyon üyelerinin tuğla ve harç politikasını kontrol etmez mi?<br/><br/>Bu basılana kadar, soru sorulmuştu ve cevap ya doğru değildi ya da hileliydi. Diğer gazeteler hikayeyi ele aldı. The Times, uzun bir raporda, Başkonsolosların Parlamento'nun veya herhangi bir kamu organının ahşap alanda herhangi bir inşa planı düşünme fırsatına sahip olması gerektiği konusunda bir girişimde bulunmaya hazır olmadıklarını söyledi.<br/><br/>Durum, Ecclesiastical Commissioners'ın 31 Mayıs 1895'te Highgate'de başlayan ve bir Ecclesiastical Commissioner'ın başkanlığında bir soruşturma açmaya zorlanmasına kadar on sekiz ay boyunca kaynadı. Soruşturma, bunun en önemli olduğu gazete mektuplarından oluşan bir telaş yarattı.<br/><br/>Günlük Chronicle, 5 Haziran 1895<br/><br/>HIGHGATE'DE VANDALISM<br/><br/>Efendim –<br/><br/>Suburan Londra'daki en güzel ormanlık alanlardan biri tehdit altında. Sadece acil bölgeye değil, yoğun nüfuslu Kuzey Londra'nın tamamına felaket olacak şeyleri önlememize yardımcı olur musunuz? Metropolün hiçbir yerinde inşaatçı Crouch End ve Hornsey'den daha aktif olmamıştır. Bir ya da iki yıl önceki güzel çayırlar artık ev ve dükkanlar. Balast yığınları görkemli karams ve kestanelerin yerini aldı ve bir zamanlar hoş köyler Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury ve Islington'un kaderini paylaşıyor.<br/><br/>---- Nesne, ormandan geçen iki kırk ayaklı yolun inşasıdır. Bu bölgede, ormandan geçen kırk ayaklı yolların anlamını biliyoruz. Bu, ormanın mahkum olduğu anlamına gelir.

Darwin, Kilise'nin öğretilerine olan inancı ayırmıştı ve birçok insan Kilise'nin gücüne sadece bu açıdan içerleyecekti. Kilise, göründüğü kadar güvenli değildi.<br/><br/>Akşam Haberleri, 7 Haziran 1895 dedi ki:<br/><br/>"Ecclesiastical Comnussioners bir kerede ele alınmazsa, bina ahtapotu daha sonra gevşetilmesi çok zor olacak ahtapotu kavrayacaktır. Bu nedenle, Londralıların en keyifli rustik manzaralarından birini kurtarmaları için ayağa kalkmaları ve yapmaları gerekir. Kamu soruşturması bir sonraki Perşembe gününe ertelendi ve bundan önce, Londra vatandaşlarının en sevdikleri oyun alanlarından birine el konulmasına müsamaha göstermeyeceğine dair Komiserleri ikna etmek için bir şeyler yapılması gerekiyor."<br/><br/>Ertesi gün Daily Chronicle'da bir mektup şöyle dedi:<br/><br/>.... Yaklaşık on yıl önce, sakinlerin Yukarı Orman'ın satın alınmasının etkili olduğunu duyması büyük bir rahatlamaydı; ve bunun ne kadar hoş bir nimet olduğunu kanıtladı, onları ziyaret eden herkes tanıklık edebilir, ancak Muswell Hill yolunun batı tarafında yer alan bu üst ormanı kurtarmak için kendilerini harcayan herkes, doğu tarafındaki altmış dönüm tehlike altında kaldığı sürece zaferlerinin eksik olduğunu hissetti. Bu, olduğu gibi, orman geniş bir yüksek yol ile bölünmüş bir kazadır. Churchyard Bottom Wood küçük villa sıraları ile değiştirilirse, her biri duman ve kurum katkısını dışarı gönderirse etkisi ne olacağından şüphe duyan var mı? Ayrıca, satın alınan ormanın pitoresk ayarında, yeni evlere bakan bir çizginin yapraklı cephelerine doğru koşması durumunda yaratacağı ciddi farktan şüphe duyan var mı?<br/><br/>Bu, birçok insanın görüşlerini ifade etti. Aslında, yazarın 'Yukarı Ahşap' dediği Çakıl Çukuru Odunu satın alınmamıştı, ancak Ecclesiastical Commission tarafından ilçeye verildi, yıllar boyunca defalarca tekrarlanacak bir noktaydı, ancak çoğu insan bunu görmezden geldi. Komisyon, kimse ne derse desin ikinci bir odun vermeyecekti ve bu pozisyonu sonuna kadar elinde tuttu.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, 5 Cranley Gardens, Times'a 8 Haziran 1895 tarihli bir mektupta, satın almayı istedi.<br/><br/>Biliyorum ki, Ecclesiastical Commissioners'dan sert bir şekilde bahsetmek yaygındır, ancak bir fonun mütevellileri olarak, sadece onu en büyük avantaja uygulamakla yükümlüdürler ve bu nedenle, ormanın yıkımını kurtarmak için bir şey yapılacaksa, bana göre, mülkün satın alınmasıyla ancak Comnussioners'tan etkilenebilir, biliyorum ki, insanlar için özgür ve açık alanların korunması için tamamen canlıdır.<br/><br/>(Bu, birkaç yıl sonra güvence altına alınan Crouch End Oyun Alanları anlamına gelir.)<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Muhafazakarlar Derneği Başkanı olarak, sürekli olarak yaşayanlarla temas halindeyim ve mahallede yaşayan herkesin korumak için her şeyi yapacağını güvenle doğrulayabilirim.<br/><br/>(Kişisel olarak istediği tek şey fakir halkını desteklemek için Charity geliriydi. Toprak dönümünü talep etti - çok da değil - Komiserlerin odunun tehlikede olmadığına dair güvencesine inandı.)<br/><br/>'Muswell Hill Yolu, Hornsey'deki en iyilerden biriydi ve eşit derecede güzel kalacaktı, evler olsun ya da olmasın.'<br/><br/>(Ve sonra büyük retorik gelişti.)<br/><br/>'Zavallıların acı çekmesi için duygusal itirazlar ve senin muhabirlerin tarafından büyütülen 'kurt'un histerik çığlığı mı var? Bir şeyler yapılmalı ve yakında. Hayırseverlik-estate'e eklenen bir dönümlük arazi, kalan toprak için hiçbir endişe verici bir fark yaratmazken, bundan elde edilen kâr, birçok yoksul yaşlı ve hak eden kişiyi azalan yıllarında yardımcı olacak ve haleflerimize, uzak gelecekte Hornsey cemaatinin hak eden yoksullarına hayırsever yardımın yapılmasında büyük bir değere sahip olacak bir mülk teslim etmemizi sağlayacaktır.<br/><br/>Mektubunu okurken yüzeye çok yakın histeri duyuyor. Neden Komiserlerin bir yol inşa etmek istediklerini düşünüyordu? Ev inşa etmek için değilse neden bu kadar para harcasınlar ki? Bir dönüm arazi için tüm odunun kaybedileceğini hiç fark etmemiş gibiydi. Ama uzun zamandır bu sorunla uğraşıyordu. Komisyon üyelerinin daha önce 25.000 sterline satış teklifinde bulunduğu kişiydi ve ahşaptan tasarruf ettiği için Crouch End Clock Tower'daki bir plakette onurlandırılan adıydı, ancak Kilise Komiserlerine olan güveni naif görünüyor. Soruşturmada şeytan olarak atanması üzücü.<br/><br/>Soruşturma Devam Ediyor<br/><br/>Ertelenen toplantı 15 Haziran 1895'te Highgate'te açıldı. Büyük bir toplanma beklentisiyle, Konsey Odası tamamen değiştirildi. Olağan masalar kaldırılmış ve oda sandalyelerle dolmuştu. Yedi buçukta oda kalabalıktı, insanlar koltuklar için koşuşturuyorlardı.<br/><br/>Komisyon Üyesi Bay Murray, Soruşturma'nın gerçekten basit bir soruşturma olduğunu söyledi. Hornsey Parochial Charities, hayır amaçlı mülklerinin arka tarafında bulunan bir arazi parçası satın almak istedi. Soru, tüm hayır kurumlarını kontrol eden Yardım Komisyonu'nun onları durdurmak için yeterli güce sahip olup olmadığıydı. Kilise Komiserleri araziyi çok elverişli şartlarda satmaya hazırdı ve Hayırseverliğin geliri çok önemli ölçüde artacaktı.<br/><br/>Buna karşı üç itiraz sınıfı vardı.<br/><br/>Orijinal Güven, Yoksullar için evler sağlamak amacıylaydı, ancak kayyumlar Yoksullar için çok pahalı olacak villalar inşa etmeyi teklif ediyorlardı. Ancak, Güven şartlarını değiştirmek Mütevelli Heyeti'nin gücü dahilindeydi, böylece sonunda Yoksul'un fayda sağlayacağını düşünürlerse villalar inşa edebilirlerdi. Yoksulların kendileri itiraz edebilir, ancak liberal hükümler onlar için zaten vaat edilmişti. Sorunun estetik ve kamusal tarafıyla ilgili üçüncü itiraz. Bunu, Yardım Komisyonu'nun, Vaiz Komisyoncularının kendi mülkleriyle ilgili olarak kendi takdirlerini kullanmalarını önlemek için müdahale etmesi gerektiğini okuduklarından aldı.<br/><br/>Soruşturma ince noktaları tartıştı, ancak konuşmacılar ahşabın herhangi bir yıkımını önleme konusundaki büyük soruna geri dönmeye devam etti. 300.000 kişiyi temsil eden Islington'un Vestry Clerk'i, ormanın herhangi bir kısmı hakkında resmi bir protesto yaptı, Islington ve Hornsey halkı için özel amaçlar için kullanılıyordu. Bay Wilfred White, Komiserler onlara zaman verirse Mütevelli Heyet'e tazminat ödemek için parayı toplayabileceklerini söyledi.<br/><br/>Bay Beaumont, villa istemediklerini, ilçe dışına sürülen fakir insanlar için kır evleri istediklerini söyledi. Diğerleri, mevcut harap olanların yerini alacak evler inşa etmek için para olmadığını, ancak villaların ekonomik bir teklif olacağını söyledi. Diğerleri Highgate'e izin verecek villa puanlarının olduğunu geri çekti. Ahşap kutsaldı. Tahta meselesine bağlı kalın.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher, çalışan insanlar arasındaki çığlığın gidecek bir yer olmadığını söyledi. Çalışan insanlar ona "Biz Highgate'den sürüldük ve Highgate New Town'a gitmek zorunda kaldık" diye haykırarak geldi. Eğer Muswell Hill Yolu cephesi satılsaydı, Hornsey yönünde yolların ormandan kesilebileceğine şüphe yoktu, ancak Komiserler araziyi Yardım Komisyonu'ndan alamazlarsa, yolu kesemezlerdi.<br/><br/>Evlerin uygun bir onarım durumuna getirilebileceğinden çok emindi. Yoksullar tarafından, polis tarafından ve işçi sınıflarının bir kısmı tarafından bu iki noktayı temsil etmesi istendi, Highgate'te kulübe konaklamasına çok ihtiyaç duyuldu ve bir kez arazinin satılmasına izin verirlerse, inşaatçının elinin nerede kalacağı belli değildi.<br/><br/>(Yüce ve uzun süren tezahüratlar).<br/><br/>Çok sayıda başka kişi konuştu ve Konsensüsçü, hakim görüşün kır evlerini elinde tutmaktan yana olduğunu ancak toplantının söylediklerinden (Groans) hiçbir sonuç çıkarmaması gerektiğini söyleyerek özetledi.<br/><br/>Diğerleri ise Charity Mütevelli Heyeti'nin evlerinin bakımsız kalmasına izin vererek görevlerinde başarısız olduğunu söyledi.<br/><br/>Daha önce gazeteye yazan Mütevelli Heyeti üyesi Bay H.R. Williams, Kilise Komiserlerinin hiçbir şekilde yol yapmayacaklarını ve Charity Commissioners'ın eylemleriyle bir iota fayda görmeyeceklerini en iyi otoriteye sahip olduğunu söyledi. Diğerleri çok daha az güveniyordu ve toplantı yaklaşık üç saat sonra kapandı.<br/><br/>Highgate ve Muswell Hill'de, Churchyard Bottom Wood'u isteyen ve elde edene kadar mutlu olmayacak bir dizi kişi olduğu gerçeğiyle karşı karşıyayız - kimse bunun için para harcamak için bir şey harcamaya istekli görünmüyor. Herkes ahşabın açık alan olarak olmasının güzel bir şey olacağını söyler, ama herkes bunu bir başkasının görevi olarak görür. Islington Vestry bu konuda 'çözüldü', ancak Islington Vestry satın alma için bir kuruşluk bir parça sunmuyor. --- Toplum ya da bireyin çözmesi gereken daha zor bir sorun yoktur, bunun için ödeme yapmadan başkalarının mallarına nasıl sahip olunacağıdır.<br/><br/>Bunun için ödeme yapmak gerçekten de sorundu, çünkü Churchyard Bottom Wood yoğun yerel ve ulusal tartışma konusu oldu. Odunları kurtarmak için para toplamak için ortak bir komite kuruldu. 20 Kasım 1896'da C.F. Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, o zamanlar günlük bir gazete olan The Standard'a yardım çağrısı yaparak yazdı. Herkese odunu kaybetmenin tehlikesini hatırlattı ve sadece satın alarak kurtarılabileceğini söyledi. Kilise Komiserleri, 25.000 sterline ve ekstra bir miktara (eskrim ve drenaj için 5.000 sterlin gerekecekti, toplam 30.000 sterlin) satacaktı. Bu, Hornsey Konseyi için çok fazlaydı, ancak toplam 10.000 sterline oy vermişlerdi. Orman, Kuzey Londra'nın tümü için paha biçilmez bir değerdi, bu yüzden kalan 20.000 sterlini yükseltmek için kamu organlarına ve özel kişilere başvurdu. Kilise Komiserlerinden gelen mevcut teklifin sadece 1898'in sonuna kadar açık olduğu konusunda uyardı. Ondan sonra inşaatçılar taşınacaklardı.<br/><br/>Temyiz basın tarafından sıcak karşılandı. Özel bir Tasarı Meclis'ten aceleye getirildi ve Highgate Woods Koruma Yasası, 1897, yasa haline geldi. Conunittee şimdi Ahşap satın alma ve koruma konusundaki katkıları için reklam yapma hakkına sahipti.<br/><br/>Oldukça kısa bir süre içinde neredeyse tüm paralar toplandı, ancak son birkaç binin yükseltilmesi çok zordu ve Komiserlerin son teslim tarihi birkaç hafta uzaktaydı. Bay Cory-Wright daha fazla zaman için yalvarma yazdı, ancak sadece üç ay verildi ve daha sonra sadece yüzde 4'teki faizin tam toplam ekstra süre için ödendiği takdirde. Sonunda, başlangıçta 2.500 sterlin teklif eden Londra İlçe Konseyi, bunu 5.000 sterline kadar çıkardı ve toplamına ulaşıldı, ancak bu yakın bir şeydi.<br/><br/>Konsey, Kraliçe Victoria'nın Elmas Jübilesi ve Hornsey'nin onuruna Wood'u 'Kraliçe'nin Ormanı' olarak yeniden adlandırmaya karar verdi ve Albany Düşesi resmi olarak Wood'un 'sonsuza kadar halkın ücretsiz kullanımı için' açık olduğunu ilan ettiğinde bunting'in güzel bir görüntüsünü sergiledi.<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood'u kurtarma kampanyası, bu özel ormanlık alan hakkında tutkulu bir şekilde hisseden yerel insanlar tarafından yürütülürken ve yönetilirken, bazıları otuz yılı aşkın bir süredir benzer kampanyalarda birlikte çalışan geniş bir insan ağının yardımını ve deneyimini çağırdılar. Komite, çok kaliteli kağıda basılmış ve bazı ünlü isimler taşıyan bir itiraz yayınladı.<br/><br/>Açık alan ve halk sağlığı soruları Viktorya görüşünün önemli konularıydı.<br/><br/>Açık Alanlar Hareketi<br/><br/>Marylebone'daki üç eski evle başlayan, Jolm Ruskin tarafından satın alınan büyük konut reformcusu Octavia Hill, yoksul insanları mümkün olan en sağlıklı koşullarda barındırma konusunda hızla bir uzman haline gelmişti. Onun yolu kiraları satın almak ve daha sonra geri kalanına ışık ve hava getirmek için kalabalık evlerin bir kısmını devirerek, fakir insanların 'acıyan ateşten' kurtarılabilmesinin tek yolunun temiz hava ve güneş ışığı olduğuna inanıyordu. Bunu, King's Cross'taki Fever Hastanesi'nde teorilerini geliştiren dedesi Southwood Smith'ten çocukken öğrenmişti.<br/><br/>Fakir insanlar için ilk Endüstriyel Konutları inşa etmişti ve istatistiksel olarak iyi hava ve düzgün drenajın hayat kurtardığını kanıtlamıştı. Northwold Road'daki Gibson Gardens, Southwood Smith'in fikirlerinin doğrudan bir sonucudur. Gibson Gardens hakkında daha fazla bilgi<br/><br/>Açık Havanın Önemi<br/><br/>Açık alanlar ve temiz hava soluma fırsatı, bir veya iki kalabalık odada yaşayan insanlar için gerekliydi. Octavia Hill, Fitzjohn's Avenue'den Hampstead Heath'e kadar olan Lisson Grove gecekondularından suçlamalarını aldı. Fitzjohn's Avenue tarlalarını o kadar çok sevdi ki, halka açık bir park olarak satın almaya çalıştı. 10 bin sterline mal olacaklardı ve üç Ağustos haftası içinde 8,500 sterlin yükseltildi. Sadece yaz tatilinin sonuna ve sempatik arkadaşların tatilinden dönüşüne ihtiyaç vardı ve daha da fazla 1500 sterlin yükseltilecekti, ancak sahipleri aniden tekliflerini geri çekti. Tüm yalvarışlara rağmen, tarlalar büyük evlerle kaplıydı.<br/><br/>Bundan, Lisson Grove'dan kuzeye doğru bir sonraki açık alan olan Parlamento Tepesi'ni kurtarmak için kampanyayı geliştirdi, ilerleyen tuğlalara karşı kalıcı bir kordon sanitalre yapmak için inşaatçıların yolunda tarlalar satın aldı. Parlamento Hill Fields kampanyası o kadar başarılı oldu ki Hampstead Heath Bill kabul edildi ve temyizden para geçti. Bu paradan ve açık alanlara doğru olan itici güçten Ulusal Güven'i geliştirmekti. Octavia Hill, yıllardır Church Bottom Wood gibi bölgeleri korumakla ilgileniyordu, bu yüzden Wood'u kurtarmak için mücadelede doğal bir müttefikti.<br/><br/>Commons Koruma Derneği de bu tür ajitasyon ve para toplamaya aşinaydı. Malikanenin lordları, ortak toprakların parçalarını kuşattığında eskrimi yıktılar ve geleneksel olarak özgür olan toprakların kibirli özelleşmesine karşı hem yasal hem de yasadışı savaşlara öncülük ettiler. Robert Hunter, 1868'den itibaren onların Fahri Avukatı, her zaman büyük ya da küçük, halk için açık alanları güvence altına almakla ilgileniyordu. Şimdi Sir Robert Hunter, Kilise Alt Temyiz Başkanı oldu. Avam Kamarası Koruma Derneği Başkanı, Avam Kamarası'ndaki bu ve diğer kampanyalarda büyük rol oynayan Shaw-Lefevre Milletvekili (daha sonra Lord Eversley) idi. Octavia Hill, yaklaşık 1875'ten itibaren çalışmalarına dahil olmuştu.<br/><br/>Aynı zamanda Octavia Hill bir Burials Bill için kampanya yürütüyordu.<br/><br/>Şehir kilise bahçeleri o kadar dolu ve sağlık için o kadar ciddi bir tehlike haline gelmişti ki, insanların içme suyunu çektikleri kuyuları kirleterek, şehir mezarlarına artık izin verilmemişti. Bunun yerine, kasabanın eteklerinde mezarlıklar oluşturuldu. Abney Park Mezarlığı bunlardan biriydi. Daha sonra mezar taşlarını eski şehir mezarlıklarının kenarlarına çıkarmak, cesetleri başka bir yere yeniden yerleştirmek ve mezarlıkları bahçelere ve açık alanlara dönüştürmek için bir hareket vardı. Londra'nın merkezindeki bu arazi çok değerliydi ve spekülatörler bunu elde etmeye hevesliydi: Quakerlar bile mezarlıklarından birinin üzerine inşa etmişlerdi ve bunu Bunhill Fields'ın üzerine inşa ederek tekrar yapmakla tehdit ettiler. Octavia Hill'in bir düzine alanda bir müttefik ağı vardı, bu yüzden Church Bottom Wood'u kurtarmak için yaptığı yardım paha biçilmez olmalıydı.<br/><br/>1882'de kurulan Metropolitan Gardens Society, 1890 yılına kadar şehir merkezlerinde yaklaşık iki yüz küçük bahçe açmıştı. Daha sonra bunları Yerel Yönetimlere devrettiler, bu nedenle Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal'e destekleri başlangıçtan itibaren güvence altına alındı.<br/><br/>Kırle Cemiyeti şimdi unutulmuştur, ancak zamanında Şehir Planlaması ve Açık Alan mevzuatı üzerinde büyük etkisi olmuştur. Toplum, 1875 yılında ‘Güzelliğin Difüzyonu’ için kurulmuş, donuk, sıkıcı bir çevrede yaşayan insanların hayatlarına renk ve ilgi kazandırmak için kurulmuştur. Duvarlara ve dekorasyona parlak renk, iyi şarkı söyleme, açık alanlar, Doğa, Edebiyat ve Sanat. Tüm bunlar Cemiyet'in remiti içinde düştü. William Morris'in ders verdiği bir Dekoratif Şube vardı; Yerel okul binalarındaki insanlar için koroları ve Mutlu Akşamları teşvik etmek için bir Müzik Şubesi; ve bir Edebiyat Şubesi. Toplum, The Times'ta düzenli olarak mektuplarla, kitap ve süreli yayınların erkek ve kız kulüplerine, sadakaevlerine ve başka yerlere dağıtılması için 'zengin sınıflara' başvurdu. Ancak Açık Alanlar Komitesi en aktifti. 'Kyrle' adı, Pope'un doğum yerini halka açık bir park olarak veren hayırsever Ross'un Adamı'ndan geldi. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it.

I really enjoyed seei... | Şükran Günü köşedeyken, kızlar için yaptığımız bazı şenlikli dosya klasörü oyunları var. Her iki Şükran Günü oyunu da matematik becerilerine odaklanıyor. Ve kocam Ed'e bir kez daha teşekkür ediyorum, benim için tüm klipartları yaptıkları için.<br/><br/>Şükran Günü Desen Yapımı<br/><br/>Adından da anlaşılacağı gibi, bu oyun desenler yapmakla ilgilidir. Küçük olanlar sadece desenleri öğrenirken, resimleri desen şeritlerine sığdırabilir, diğerleri ise boş şeritlerdeki resim kartlarıyla desene devam edebilir.<br/><br/>Dosya klasörünü yapmak için, kart parçalarını yapmak için resimlerin ızgarasını kesmek istersiniz. Daha uzun süre dayanmalarına yardımcı olmak için bunları lamine etmenizi öneririm. Ardından desen şeritlerini dosya klasörüne yapıştırın.<br/><br/>Boş desen şeritlerinin de olmasını istedim, böylece kızlar deseni nereye devam ettireceklerini ve kaç tanesini ortaya koyabileceklerini görebiliyorlardı. Onları bant kullanarak klasörün yanına bağladım, böylece oyunu paketlemek ve deseni düzenlemek için katlanabiliyorlardı.<br/><br/>Ayrıca, kızların da kendi desenlerini yapabilmeleri için fazladan boş bir tane ekledim.<br/><br/>Türkiye Sayı Oyunu<br/><br/>Bu oyunda kızlar sayma ve sayı tanıma pratiği yaparken tüyleri hindi vücuduna eklerler. Renksiz tüyleri, tüyleri nereye ekleyeceğine ve kızların sayılarla eşleşebilmesi için bir rehber olarak hareket etmek için kullandım. Ve hindi gövdesini yapıştırırken sadece merkeze yapıştırdığınızdan emin olun, böylece kanat parçaları vücudun altına kayabilir.<br/><br/>Tüm tüyler serildikten sonra, üç tüyü almak ve kaç tane kaldığını görmek gibi basit bir aritmetik uygularız, daha sonra neye eşit olduğunu görmek için iki tane daha ekleriz.<br/><br/>Siyah ve beyaz kanatların yanı sıra, küçüklerin kendi setlerini renklendirmek istemeleri durumunda renksiz bir hindi de dahil ettik. Bir dosya klasörü oyunu yerine bunu bir zanaat haline getirebilir, parçaları renklendirebilir, kesebilir ve birbirine yapıştırabilirsiniz.<br/><br/>Başka bir seçenek, parçaları keçeli bir tahta hikayesi yapmak için kullanmaktır. Bazen 10 Küçük Kızılderili'nin hindi versiyonunu söylüyoruz:<br/><br/>Şöyle:<br/><br/>Kimim ben?<br/><br/>Sanırım kendim hakkında esprili bir şey söylemem gereken yer burası. Oh iyi. Üç harika çocuğa evde kalan bir anneyim - şu anda yedi olan ikiz kızlarımız ve enerji dolu iki yaşındaki bir oğlum. Çocuk öncesi hayatımda bir öğretmendim ve şimdi çocuklarımızı evde eğitiyorum. Ayrıca şu anda Hava Kuvvetleri'nde görev yapan Ed ile evliyim ve hayatımın aşkı (eğer olmasaydı garip olurdu). Ailemiz kitaplara, el sanatlarına ve birlikte eğlenmeye büyük önem veriyor. Sadece aktivitelerimizi internetin kendi küçük köşemde paylaşacağımı düşündüm.<br/><br/>Zoe her şeye sahip gibi görünüyor - zengin, yakışıklı koca, kolay New York hayatı - ama geçmişinde hatalar yaptı ve bu hatalar yeni hayatında geri geliyor. Kendimi kitabın çoğu için koltuğumun kenarında buldum ve şaşırdım ...<br/><br/>Bu kitabı sevdim, hikayeyi seviyorum ve Margot Shetterly'nin bunu gün ışığına çıkardığı için minnettarım. Tek şikayetim Katherine Johnson'ın sonraki görevlerdeki rolünü biraz daha tartışmasını dilememdi ama sanırım hikaye som...<br/><br/>Bu kitabı sevmek istedim ve çoğu boyunca yaptım.

| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | 21 yaşın altındaki kişiler tarafından alkol kullanımı büyük bir halk sağlığı sorunu olarak tanımlandı. Çalışmalar, engellilik risklerini artırdığını ve gelişmekte olan beyin için zararlı olabileceğini belirtmektedir. İçki içenlerin intihar etme, yasaları çiğneme veya şiddet mağduru olma olasılığı daha yüksektir. Alkol, genç trafik ölümlerinin yaklaşık üçte birinde yer almaktadır. Yaş altı içmenin toplam yıllık maliyeti 62 milyar dolar olarak tahmin edilmektedir. Reşit olmayanların içki içmesini önlemeye yönelik yasaların çoğu eyalet düzeyinde kabul edilmekle birlikte, eyaletlerin sorunu frenleme çabalarını desteklemek için federal düzeyde yasama faaliyeti ve ilgi olmuştur. Bu rapor, reşit olmayan alkol kullanımının kapsamını, bu konudaki son yasama faaliyetini ve çeşitli politika etkilerini açıklamaktadır. Yeni veriler kullanılabilir hale geldikçe güncellenecektir. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives? Continue reading →<br/><br/>Share this:<br/><br/>My knife plunged into the beef with an audible crunch, pop, and sizzle.<br/><br/>"Whooaaah!"<br/><br/>I looked up at my sister as we both laughed in surprise, and continued smiling as I finished cutting my first bite. The unique outer crispiness of the meat gave way to a perfectly juicy interior, resulting in a sound more similar to slicing into a calzone than a ground beef patty.<br/><br/>We were sitting in Copenhagen's oldest pub, which felt more like a casual bistro than a bar, and I was about to try the dish recommended by our waitress/bar tender/proprietor?<br/><br/>"The Paris Beef, it's very good," she had said.

Gıda reformuyla sonuçlanan siyasi lobicilik ya da kamu dilekçesi değildi, aksine vatandaşların gerçekten uygulama ve değişimle takip etme gücüne sahip olduğu bir taban çabasıydı.<br/><br/>Bir soruya göndermede bulundum: Neden bunu kendimiz, bireyler olarak yapmak bu kadar zor? Eğer bütün bir ülke gıdaya karşı ortak bir görüş uygulayabiliyor ve yayabiliyorsa, neden bunu yapamıyoruz?<br/><br/>Danimarka'nın başarısını taklit etmemizi engelleyen bir şey yok. Sorun şu ki, ne yememiz gerektiği ve nasıl yaşamamız gerektiği konusunda çok fazla mesajla dolup taşmış durumdayız, nereden başlayacağımızı bilmek zor. Bu nedenle, işe yaradığı gösterilen başarılı çerçeveleri takip etmek yerine (Nordik Gıda Manifestosu gibi), çoğu insan diyet çılgınlığından diyet çılgınlığına atlar ve "yemek yemenin doğru yolunu" bulmaya çalışır.<br/><br/>Ama Claus Meyer nasıl başarılı oldu? Manifesto'nun tutunmasına yardımcı olan gizli sos neydi? Ve bu dersleri kendi hayatımıza uygulayabileceğimizi düşünmek mantıklı mı?
