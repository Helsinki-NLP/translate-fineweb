| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. Since 2011, she has served as chair of the Democratic National Committee. Follow her on Twitter.<br/><br/>The Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff. | Kırk dokuz yıl önce bugün Başkan Lyndon B. Johnson 1965 Oy Hakkı Yasası'nı imzaladı.<br/><br/>Reklam<br/><br/>Yaklaşık bir yüzyıl önce, Anayasa'daki 15. Değişiklik, "ABD vatandaşlarının oy kullanma hakkı, ırk, renk veya önceki kölelik durumu nedeniyle ABD veya herhangi bir devlet tarafından reddedilemez veya kısaltılamaz" dedi. Ve bundan yaklaşık bir yüzyıl önce, ulusumuzun kurucu babaları, "tüm insanlar eşit yaratılmıştır" diyerek Amerikan demokrasisinin büyük deneyini harekete geçirdiler.<br/><br/>1965 Oy Hakkı Yasası, Amerika'da bile, temel ideallerimizin hukukun üstünlüğü tarafından korunmadığı takdirde çok az ağırlık taşıdığı gecikmiş bir kabuldü. Bu nedenle 15. maddenin 2. bölümü Kongre'ye "bu maddeyi uygun mevzuatla uygulama yetkisi" verdi.<br/><br/>Ve gerçekten de, Oy Hakkı Yasası'nın kodlanmış dili, Yeniden Yapılanma Dönemi Kongresi ve Thomas Jefferson'un yapamadığını başarabildi. 1964 Sivil Haklar Yasası ve Oy Hakkı Yasası - ve ortaya çıktıkları sivil haklar hareketi - siyah Amerikalıların demokratik sürece katılma fırsatının dramatik bir şekilde artmasının katalizörü olarak hizmet etti.<br/><br/>Örneğin, uygun siyah Mississippililerin sadece yüzde 6,7'si 1962'den itibaren oy kullanmak için kaydedildi; 1969'a kadar bu rakam yüzde 66.5'e ulaşmıştı. Bugün, Mississippi'nin diğer eyaletlerden daha fazla siyahi seçilmiş yetkilisi var.<br/><br/>Oy Hakkı Yasası'nın yürürlüğe koyduğu korumalar, kabul edildiklerinde uzun süre gecikmiş, elde edildikleri zorlu mücadelenin temsilcisi olmuştur. Ancak bu korumalar düşünülmeden, şu anda saldırı altında, ulusumuzun elde etmek için çok çabaladığı ilerlemeyi tehlikeye atıyor.<br/><br/>Geçen yıl, Shelby County v Holder davasında, ABD Yüksek Mahkemesi, herhangi bir yeni oylama yasası yürürlüğe girmeden önce ayrım gözetmemeyi sağlamak için önceki federal incelemeyi sağlayan Oy Hakkı Yasası'nın önemli bir bileşenini gutladı.<br/><br/>Reklam<br/><br/>Ne yazık ki, Cumhuriyetçi liderlerin cevabı hiçbir şey yapmamak oldu. Senatör Ted Cruz ve Vali Rick Perry, Yüksek Mahkeme'nin kararını övmek için yollarını ayırdılar. Senatör Rand Paul, Oy Hakkı Yasası'nın devam eden gerekliliğini "Afrikalı-Amerikalı bir başkanımız var" diyerek reddetti.<br/><br/>Başkan Barack Obama'nın seçilmesi gerçekten tarihi bir dönüm noktası olsa da, bunun ulusumuzun geçmişinin devam eden sonuçlarına karşı uyanık kalmamızı engelleyeceğini düşünmek tehlikelidir.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Q&A: Vatikan koruma uzmanı Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 Haziran 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Görüntü: Avustralya Cizvitleri.<br/><br/>Roma'daki Gregorian Üniversitesi Çocuk Koruma Merkezi Başkanı ve Küçüklerin Korunması için Pontifical Komisyonu üyesi Fr Hans Zollner SJ, 2018'de Avustralya'da Katolik bakanlık liderleri ve hayatta kalanlarla konuşmak için bulundu.<br/><br/>Cizvit İletişim'den Michael McVeigh, Kilise'nin istismar krizine uluslararası alanda nasıl tepki verdiğini ve Avustralya'daki deneyimlerimizden neler öğrenilebileceğini araştırmak için ziyaret sırasında onunla birlikte oturdu.<br/><br/>MM: Bu Avustralya'ya üçüncü seyahatiniz. Kilisenin dünya çapında istismara nasıl tepki verdiğini görmek için oldukça fazla başka ülkeyi ziyaret ettiniz. Küresel resmin neye benzediği hakkında bize bir fikir verebilir misiniz?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: Benim anladığım, beş ya da altı kıtada yaklaşık 50 ülkeyi ziyaret ettikten sonra, Kilise'nin kurbanlara adalet yapma, onları dinleme ve koruma açısından ne yapılabiliyorsa yapma konusunda son birkaç yılda gerçekten hareket etmeye başladığıdır.<br/><br/>Nisan ayının sonunda Afrika'nın her yerinden Cizvit İlleri ile birlikteydim ve Afrika ve Madagaskar Cizvit Yardımcılığı Başkanı bu konuda çok kararlı ve kararlıdır. Oluşum için ve her yerde kılavuzları tanıtmak için kapsamlı bir eylem planı hazırladı. Afrika'daki Cizvitler olarak proaktif bir şekilde meşgul olmak için yapılabilecek her şeyi yapmak çok düşünceli ve çok kasıtlı bir çabadır - birkaç yıl öncesine kadar tüm bunların yabancı bir dil olduğu bir kıtada.<br/><br/>Bu küresel yaklaşımı geliştirmeye çalışmanın zorluklarından biri, çok fazla kültür ve çok farklı anlayışlarla karşı karşıya olmanızdır. Bunu nasıl bir araya getiriyorsunuz ve bu konuları ele alan dini topluluklara eğitim ve destek sağlamaya çalışıyorsunuz?<br/><br/>Bu, sahip olduğumuz en önemli sorulardan biri. Bence yapabileceğim şey, tartışmayı teşvik etmek, yansımayı teşvik etmek ve insanları mümkün olduğunca hazırlamak, böylece temel çalışmaları yapabilirler.<br/><br/>Gregorian Üniversitesi Çocuk Koruma Merkezi, her soruya cevap veriyormuş gibi davranmıyor. Sadece belirli bağlamları bilmediğimiz için değil - bunlardan birkaçını biliyor olabiliriz, ancak binlerce kültürden bahsediyoruz, yüzlerce dilden bahsediyoruz, çok çeşitli yasal geçmişlerden bahsediyoruz. Bazen bir ülke içinde bile değişir, örneğin Avustralya'nın Commonwealth'inde diğer eyaletlerden farklı yasalara sahip eyaletleriniz vardır.<br/><br/>Ben tartışmayı ve yansımayı ortaya çıkarmaya ve teşvik etmeye çalışan biriyim. İnsanları dinlemekten de çok mutluyum.<br/><br/>Avustralya'da Kraliyet Komisyonu'nun burada olduğu aşikar, ama kurbanların seslerinin dünya çapında desteklendiğini gördüğünüz diğer yollardan bazıları nelerdir?<br/><br/>Fransa'da 'Dinleme Alanı' adını verdikleri bir piskoposluk var. Orada kurbanlar öne çıkabilir ve kendilerini ifade edebilirler. Piskopos hazır. Bu, muazzam derecede incinmiş insanların en azından Kilise liderliğinden vb. ne sormak istediklerini ifade etmekte özgür oldukları açık bir alandır.<br/><br/>ABD'de veya diğer ülkelerde, kurbanların piskoposlar tarafından, eyaletler tarafından, Kilise'nin liderliği tarafından öne çıkması için davet edildiği başka yerler de var. Şunu söylemek zorundayım ki genel olarak iyi bir niyet olduğunu düşünüyorum ve piskoposlar ve taşralılar gibi kurbanları bizden daha fazla dinleyen insanlar var. Ancak kurbanlara sadece kendilerini ifade edecek ve dinlenecek alan vermek için değil, aynı zamanda Kilise'nin gelişimine aktif olarak dahil olmak için de bir model yoktur.<br/><br/>Kurbanlar için destek alanları oluşturmak açısından, gerçekten yardımcı olabilecek ve burada Avustralya'da göz önünde bulundurabileceğimiz bazı şeyler nelerdir?<br/><br/>Birçok kurbanın gündeme getirdiği en önemli noktalardan biri, ‘Kilise ayarları içinde, okul ayarları içinde, bir komitenin, bir komisyonun, bir ses kurulunun, bir geri bildirim grubunun veya benzeri bir şeyin düzenli üyeleri olarak istismardan kurtulanları içeren düzenli bir konuşma yapamaz mıyız?’ Öyle ki, bu ses sadece belirli bir olayda ya da bir kişinin onun hakkında konuşabilecek bir noktada olduğunu hissettiği yerde değil, düzenli olarak duyulur - bu sesi sisteme inşa edin.<br/><br/>Bu hepimize yardımcı olacak. Hayatta kalanlara ve kurbanlara yardımcı olacak çünkü belirli bir deneyimde ve yaşadıkları belirli yaşam zorluklarında hoş karşılanacaklarını ve takdir edileceklerini hissedecekler. İkinci olarak, topluma büyük ölçüde yardımcı olacaktır, çünkü en azından hayatta kalanların endişelerinin ve özel ihtiyaçlarının ne olduğuna kendimizi daha hassas hale getirebiliriz - bu da gençlerin ihtiyaçlarıyla konuşabilir.<br/><br/>M: Avustralya'da bu süreçte birbirlerini destekleyebilen güçlü hayatta kalan gruplarımız var. Ama demek istediğiniz, bu grupları desteklemenin ve bu insanları kendi kurumlarımız aracılığıyla desteklemenin bir yolunu bulmamız gerektiği mi?<br/><br/>Ve bence yaratıcı olmalıyız. Bir okul, bir cemaat ve bir piskoposluk için tek bir şekilde, diğerleri için ise farklı bir şekilde çalışacaktır. Sürekli temas halinde olduğum hayatta kalanlar, Kilise'de karşılanmama ya da dışlanmama konusunda oldukça benzer taleplere ve benzer deneyimlere sahipler - atılmış ya da kovulmuş gibi hissediyorlar. Ama aynı zamanda kendi aralarında da oldukça farklı beklentileri var. Bu yüzden, bu belirli grubun veya bu belirli kurtulanın, istekleri, istekleri ve ihtiyaçları arasındaki farklılıkları kabul etme konusunda da çok açık olmanız gerektiğini öğrendim.<br/><br/>M: Hayatta kalanlar hikayelerinin duyulmasını ve kabul edilmesini istemekten bahsediyor. Burada Avustralya'da, kurbanların ortaya çıkabileceği bağımsız bir süreç sağlayan Kraliyet Komisyonu var. Kilise için uluslararası bir gerçek, adalet ve uzlaşma süreci açısından böyle bir şeye ihtiyaç var mı?<br/><br/>H: Evet, bence uluslararası alanda buna ihtiyaç var. Ama önce her yerel kilisenin kendi ödevini yapması gerektiğini düşünüyorum. Bu tür bir konseyin veya komisyonun tüm Kilise için bu alana bakması çok yakında gerçekleşeceğini sanmıyorum. Kilise 1,3 milyar kişilik bir üyeye sahiptir ve 190 ülkede, psikolojik, ruhsal ve finansal destekle ilgili beklentilerde her türlü farklılıkla birlikte mevcuttur.<br/><br/>Sürekli iletişim kurmak, kurbanlarla çalışmak ve onları dinlemekle karşılaştığım bir şey var ve o da onların dinlenmesi gerektiği. Bu yüzden, eğer kurbanların sürekli olarak dinlendiği hissi varsa -Roma'da ve başka yerlerde - bunun birçok kurbana büyük bir rahatlama sağlayacağını düşünüyorum.<br/><br/>Bence [Pope Francis'in] endişesi, özellikle de sorunuzla ilgili olarak, yerel kiliselerin o ülkede mağdurların dinlenmesi için ellerinden geleni yapmalarıdır. Kutsal Baba ile doğrudan konuşmak isteyen insanların bir listesi var ve fiziksel olarak bu mümkün değil. Ben 2014 yılında iki İrlandalı ve iki İngiliz hayatta kalanla birlikte seçilen iki Alman hayatta kalanın altısını evde aldığında tercüme etmek için oradaydım. Bütün sabahı birbiri ardına onları dinleyerek geçirdi. Her biri için 40-45 dakika boyunca orada kaldı.Bunu artık uyuyamadığı her kurtulan için yapsaydı.<br/><br/>Onun örneği, tüm Katolik Kilisesi için kurbanların ve hayatta kalanların nasıl karşılandığını, karşılandığını ve dinlendiğini modellemektir. Bence eğer bu dünyadaki piskoposlar ve taşralılar, tüm ülkelerde onun örneğini izleselerdi, hayatta kalanların çoğu gerçekten buna minnettar olurdu.<br/><br/>Başpiskopos Diarmud Martin yakın zamanda Dünya Aileler Toplantısı'ndan hemen önce Pontifical Komisyonu'ndan alıntı yaptı, şu anda başarmak için gerekenleri elde etmek için kurulduğu için çok küçük olduğunu söyledi. Kilisenin bu konuları nasıl yönettiğine daha fazla kaynak koyması gerekiyor mu?<br/><br/>Şu anda temelde tüm kıtalardan 16 üyeyiz ve ana dil gruplarıyız. Çeşitli disiplinleri ve meslekleri temsil ediyoruz ve komisyonun amacı - yeni ilan edilen yasalar olarak - Kutsal Baba'ya danışmanlık yapmaktır.<br/><br/>Komisyonla ilgili yaygın bir yanlış anlama, ilk olarak iddia davalarıyla ilgilenmemizdir. Durum böyle değildir. Davalarla ilgili hukuki veya idari bir yetkimiz yok, çünkü konu suistimal iddialarına gelince mahkemeler ve usuller belirlenir.<br/><br/>İkinci bir yanlış anlama da, doğrudan doğruya, her şeyi zeminde teşvik etmemizdir. İlk ve en önemli hedefimiz, Kutsal Babamıza meseleler hakkında tavsiyelerde bulunmamızdır.<br/><br/>Benim açımdan evet, daha fazla yatırım yapmalıyız. Ancak yerel düzeyde daha fazla yatırım yapmamız gerekiyor ve Pontifical Komisyonu'ndan gelen tekliflerin Kutsal Baba'ya iletildiğinden emin olmalıyız - normalde Başkan'ın yaptığı - ve daha sonra tavsiyemiz olarak verdiğimiz şeyleri yansıtan bir takip süreci var.<br/><br/>Avustralya'da Katolik Profesyonel Standartlar Limited, Kilise'nin tepkisini denetliyor ve Kilise'deki tüm kurumların çocuk güvenliği kurumları olmasını sağlamak için kılavuzlar ve destek sağlıyor. Bu kurumları kurmak ve bu piskoposluklarda koruma sağlamak için mücadele eden piskoposlar ve piskoposlar için Roma'dan bir tür örgütsel desteğe ihtiyaç var mı?<br/><br/>Bence sonuçta komisyon bu çizgide gelişecek. Şu anda bu alanlarda uzman işe alma sürecindeler.<br/><br/>Bence Kilise'nin, yerel kiliselerin birbirlerinden karşılıklı olarak öğrenebileceğini anlaması gerekiyor. Ve benim anlayışım her zaman - ve Kutsal Baba'nın bize hatırlattığını düşünüyorum - Kilise'nin merkezi bir şirket olarak işlev görmeyeceğini. Bu şekilde, etkili bir şekilde çalışmaz. Her piskopos, her piskopos konferansı, bir dereceye kadar kendi yaşamına sahiptir. Daha fazla öğrenmemiz gereken şey karşılıklı iletişim kanallarını açmaktır.<br/><br/>İnsanların Kilise'de istismardan suçladıkları bir takım şeyler var. Bir rahip ve psikolog olarak ve hayatta kalanlarla tanışıp çalışan biri olarak, bu konudaki düşünceleriniz nelerdir?<br/><br/>Bence istismarın nereden geldiği sorusu en önemlisidir ve Papa, 20 Ağustos'ta yayınlanan Tanrı halkına yazdığı mektupta bunu ele almıştır. İlk paragrafta, cinsel istismar sorununun her zaman -ya da hemen hemen her zaman - sadece gücün kötüye kullanılması sorunuyla değil, aynı zamanda vicdanın kötüye kullanılmasıyla da bağlantılı olduğunu tekrar tekrar söyler.<br/><br/>Yani asıl temel suistimal sorunu cinsellikten çok daha karmaşıktır - heteroseksüel ya da homoseksüel olsun. Bu bir güç meselesi ve orada rahipliği nasıl anlayacağımız, piskoposluğu nasıl anlayacağımız, bakanlıklarımızı nasıl anlayacağımız ve yaşayacağımız sorusu üzerinde gerçekten çalışmalıyız. Sınırlar nelerdir?<br/><br/>Bu yüzden Avustralya'daki Cizvit Eyaleti'nin bir Davranış Kuralları oluşturmasından dolayı çok mutluyum çünkü sadece reşit olmayanların cinsel istismarından bahsetmiyoruz. Yetişkinlerin cinsel istismarı hakkında konuşuyoruz ve başka şekillerde istismar hakkında konuşuyoruz - örneğin, ne düşündüğünüzü birine dikte ettiğiniz ya da Tanrı tarafından biliyormuş gibi yaptığınız vicdan istismarı gibi, başka bir kişiye 'Bunu yapmalısınız' diyebilirsiniz, o kişinin vicdanına karşı.<br/><br/>Birçok insan bekarlığın istismara yol açtığını düşünür. Her zaman söylediğim gibi, böyle bir bekarlık kötü muameleye neden olmaz - aksi halde, tüm istismarcıların yüzde 99,9'unun bekar bir yaşam sürmediğini ve tüm rahiplerin yüzde 95 veya 96'sının küçükleri kötüye kullanmadığını nasıl açıklayabiliriz? Ama bekarlık ya da iffet yemini, bu gerçekten entegre değildir, bu gerçekten doğru bir şekilde yaşamaz - evet, bu bir sorun yaratır. Bazen insanlar içkiye, bazen kumara ve bazen de cinsel istismara, yetişkinlerle ve küçüklerle birlikte giderler.<br/><br/>Bununla ilgili asıl soru, rahiplerin ve piskoposların yatırım yaptığı dini manevi güç kavramıyla nasıl başa çıkacağımızdır. İlahiyat, anlamamıza nasıl yardımcı olabilir ve belki de sosyoloji, psikoloji veya işletme yönetimi, gücün sınırlarını ve sınırlarınızı korumanın gerekliliğini tanımlamamıza nasıl yardımcı olabilir? |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Bu uyumsuzluk beni şaşırtmadı. Aslında, bunun değişmeyecek bir şey olmadığını söyleyecek kadar ileri bile gidebilirdim, ne de bunu değiştirmek için heyecanlanmamız gerekir. 10 yıl içinde, hala en büyük endişeler listesinde kanayan kenarı, karmaşık eşyalarımız olacak ve sonunda anlamaya başladığımız şeyler harcamalarımızın önemli parçaları olacak.<br/><br/>Şimdi, Gunnar ve Andy'nin her ikisinin de mükemmel noktaları var, özellikle BT ekiplerinin BT problemlerini görmeleri ve BT çözümleriyle çözmeleri hakkında; Aslında, puanlarının hak ettiği konusunda eminim.<br/><br/>Ama sanırım bunlardan üstün olan başka fikirler de var (bu konuda bloglarında yorum yaptım ve daha sonra sadece burada blog yazmam gerektiğine karar verdim). Bu ilk 3 endişe kanamalı bir şekilde yenidir, öyle ki:<br/><br/>Yeni şeylerden korkuyoruz çünkü onları anlamıyoruz ya da yeni oldukları için anlamıyoruz.<br/><br/>Onlarla başa çıkmak için sağlam yaklaşımlara sahip olmak için çok yeniler.<br/><br/>endişelenmemiz gerekip gerekmediğini bilmememiz için çok yeniler! Paranoyak / endişeli olma eğilimindeyiz, ki bu iyi!<br/><br/>kendilerine tahsis edilmiş bariz bütçe öğelerine sahip olmak için çok yeni. "bulut güvenliği" veya "sosyal medya güvenliği" sağlayan bir kutu veya yazılım satın alabilir miyim?<br/><br/>O kadar yeniler ki, işletme onları nasıl kullanacağını ya da onlardan ne istediklerini bile bilmiyor. Hala iş ihtiyaçlarını karşılarken ya da en azından tüm iş gereksinimlerini karşılarken onları nasıl güvence altına alabileceğimizi bir yana bırakın. İşletme henüz onları nasıl kullanacağını bile bilmiyorsa, güvenliğin bu kullanımı güvenli bir şekilde yönlendirecek bir konumda olduğundan emin değilim.<br/><br/>Ayrıca, bu yeni şeylerin bir tür "Oh yeah" düşüncesi olarak IT ile tüketici arazisi ve işletmeye büyük ölçüde itildiği belirtilmelidir. Güvenlik duvarları, AV, AM, Auth tipik BT sorunlarına tüm BT yanıtlarıdır. Tabii ki bir fark var. Güvenlik duvarları, bilinen kötü niyetli bitler, davranışlar, imzalar, portlar gibi çok objektif öğelerin aksine çok öznel konulardır. İş dünyası, genellikle insanları (ki yama yapamayız) içeren ve genellikle battaniye kurallarına uygun olmayan çok karmaşık konular sunar. Teknik çözümlerden uzaklaştıysak ve zamanımızı bu sorunları çözmeye adasak bile, yine de düzgün bir şekilde çözülemeyecekler. Aynı şekilde, itiş itildiğinde, güvenlik duvarları ile hedeflere sahip olabilir ve buluşabilir misiniz? İyileştirme gösterebilir misiniz? Tüm bunlar, bu konuların oldukça öznel teknik olmayan yönünden kaynaklanır. Bir çocuğun karnesi ile ebeveyn-öğretmen konferansından aldığınız geri bildirim arasındaki farkın bir çeşididir. Eğer bir çocuğunuz varsa, hangisiyle aynı fikirde olmaya ya da inanmamaya en çok eğilimli olurdunuz? (Cevap öznel olandır!)<br/><br/>Bunun güvenlik ve teknolojinin doğal ilerlemesi olduğu söylenebilir: teknik kontrolleri şişirmekten, yığınları davranış ve insanlara doğru ilerletmeye kadar. Tabii ki, bu 3 en önemli endişenin güvenlik duvarları ve ağ segmentleri aracılığıyla yumruk attığı söylenebilir, ancak bu şeylerin doğası budur (bir güvenlik duvarı aracılığıyla sosyal medya "vurma", ev ağımı köprülemek için SSH bağlantısı üzerinden yumruklamamdan çok farklıdır; sosyal medya *yoluna benzer * SSH bağlantımı, ihtiyaç duyulduğu için zaten yumruklandıktan sonra kullanıyorum; yani sosyal medya 80 numaralı portun kullanıldığı yoldur.).<br/><br/>Temel olarak, tüm göstergeler bu dikotomi ile şaşırmamaya işaret ediyor. Ve bunun IT / güvenliğin yanlış yaptığını veya iş ile düzgün bir şekilde hizalanmadığını veya teknik bir karanlık sunucu odası geçmişine sahip olduğunu gösteren başka bir gösterge olduğunu düşünmüyorum. Bir şeyleri doğru yaptığımızı ya da düzgün bir şekilde hizalandığımızı söylemiyorum, ancak yukarıdakiler bu eksikliklerin teorisini desteklemek için iyi bir argüman değildir.<br/><br/>Şimdi gerçekten büyük bir sıçrama için. Mobil hesaplamadaki mevcut artışın, bilgisayarların işletmeye girmesi ve daha sonra PC / internetin işletmeye girmesi kadar büyük olmasını istiyorum. Şimdi, ne eski olduğunda, ne de kişisel bilgisayar devriminin iş hayatına karıştığında endüstride değildim, ama bahse girerim ki şimdiye kadarki en yakın karşılaştırma budur. Hatta sosyal medya için aynı şeyi söyleyebilirim. Bunlar lanet yeni ve sadece Mac'leri veya yeni yazılımları veya yeni bir iş sürecini getirmenin ötesinde büyük değişiklikler. |

Older posts state that battery health doesnt work with aftermarket batteries, yet some people post that newer batteries now support this feature. I am thinking about ordering a replacement battery for iPhone 6 and am curious if the feature will work or not.<br/>If it doesnt work, then is there any way to tell if the phone is throttled other than running a benchmark? | 01/10/2019<br/><br/>Başlık:<br/><br/>Yedek piller şimdi pil sağlığı özelliği ile çalışıyor mu?<br/><br/>Metin:<br/><br/>Bu konuda bir ton karışık bilgi var. Eski gönderiler, pil sağlığının satış sonrası pillerle çalışmadığını, ancak bazı insanların daha yeni pillerin artık bu özelliği desteklediğini belirtiyor. iPhone 6 için yedek bir pil sipariş etmeyi düşünüyorum ve bu özelliğin işe yarayıp yaramayacağını merak ediyorum.<br/>Eğer işe yaramazsa, telefonun bir ölçüt çalıştırmaktan başka bir şekilde kısılıp kıstırılmadığını söylemenin bir yolu var mı? |
