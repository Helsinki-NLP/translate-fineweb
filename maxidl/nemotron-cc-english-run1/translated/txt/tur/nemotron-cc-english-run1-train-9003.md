| The Masterpiece: a Chain Poetry Challenge<br/><br/>John has been writing poetry since his school days. He was awarded the "Best Poet 2014 and 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet in a Japanese kimono, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>A Brief History of Collaborative, Collective, or Chain Poetry<br/><br/>Collaborative,collective, or chain poetry is an alternative and creative technique for writing poetry by more than one person. The principal aim of this type of poetry is to create poems through the collaboration of various authors/poets, trying to form a unified voice while still maintain their individual voices.<br/><br/>Examples of collaboration abound in Japanese poetry. Though the precise accounts and records of many such events are either lost or missing.<br/><br/>One of the most famous examples of collective poetry writing was the poem collection titled Ralentir Travaux by Surrealist French poets André Breton, Paul Éluard and René Char. These three poets collaborated to write the poems in this collection over just five days in 1930.<br/><br/>During the 1940s, Charles Henri Ford, an American poet, invented what he called the "chain poem", where each poet wrote a line and then sent the poem to another person (to continue) in another part of the world, by post.<br/><br/>In 2007 a collection of American collaborative poetry Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry was edited and published by Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton and David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Collaborative poetry writing has been used in schools and colleges to teach students teamwork and to discover ways in which they are connected.(source: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>Study of a Figure Outdoors: Woman with a Parasol, facing left, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain or Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Aim of This Article and How to Approach the Challenge<br/><br/>A few years back I wrote an article called "Poem Without an End" which included a Christmas poem I had written that lent itself to being added to. I was amazed by the response as at that stage I only had a few followers here. People wrote a stanza of poetry each in "comments" on the hub to follow on from the previous commenter's stanza. It worked out very well and at the end I compiled all the contributions into a single poem as part of the hub.<br/><br/>Similar challenges have been issued since, including one by Frank Atanacio called "Spirits Sat as Mourners" that was also very successful. The difference being that in that instance contributors wrote their own hubs for their stanza of poetry and placed a link on Frank's original hub.<br/><br/>For this particular challenge I don't expect everyone to spend valuable time writing separate hubs for one stanza of poetry (unless you really want to). The main problem being that to make it effective you would have to copy the previously written parts of the poem onto your hub and would probably be hit with "duplication" label.<br/><br/>So, that being the case, and also to save having to leave links everywhere, I just ask that anyone who wants to take part just write their stanza here in "comments." Check the last comment before yours that is contributing to the challenge and follow on. If I see more than one following from the same stanza I will use my poetic licence to work them in as I deem best.<br/><br/>At some stage when I feel there has been enough stanzas added I will probably call an end to the challenge and then compile them all together as the completed poem as part of the article (also giving credit to each contributor).<br/><br/>Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Challenge!<br/><br/>Now comes the interesting part. If you join this chain poetry challenge you have to try to keep the style and voice of the poem as close as possible to the preceding verses, so that to uninformed readers it will appear that only one author has written the entire poem.<br/><br/>Sounds easy, you say? Well maybe it would be if the poem had a traditional style, rhyme or meter. But this one doesn't! The poem you will be adding to was started by an acquaintance of mine Andriealphus as a "chain poem challenge" elsewhere. At the time of writing I was the only other person who had accepted the challenge, and because I loved the subject I thought it would be a great challenge for my fellow writers and decided to use it here and see if the response would be better. (I know of a few poets here whose writing would suit this style)<br/><br/>Rules :<br/><br/>Follow on from the previous stanza in comments<br/><br/>Try to retain the voice and style of the poem<br/><br/>Keep your stanza/verse to approximately the same length as those before<br/><br/>Claude Monet was one of the most famous painters in the history of art and a leading figure in the Impressionist movement.<br/><br/>In 1883 Monet moved to Giverny. Here, he loved to paint outdoors in the gardens that he helped create. The water lilies found in the pond had a particular appeal, and he painted several series of them throughout the rest of his life; the Japanese-style bridge over the pond became the subject of several works, as well.<br/><br/>In 1912 Monet painted a series of 12 waterlily paintings commissioned by the Orangerie des Tuileries, a museum in Paris. He chose to make them on a very large scale, and to serve as a "haven of peaceful meditation." This project consumed much of Monet's later years. Monet once stated, "These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me. It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel."<br/><br/>His health was now an obstacle, as well. Nearly blind, with both of his eyes seriously affected by cataracts, Monet finally agreed to undergo surgery for the ailment in 1923.<br/><br/>Monet's famous water lilies turned redder as his cataracts progressed. After getting corrective surgery he destroyed most of the "red lily" paintings, angry that no one really mentioned it to him. Ironically, these paintings were probably what made his impressionistic style so famous in that time -- artists started taking more risks with color and such during this point. (source: biography.com)<br/><br/>The Masterpiece<br/><br/>"The boy sitting behind you says you look like a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ask him, has he ever seen a Monet up close?<br/><br/>Close enough to see nothing but muddled strokes of weedy lakeshore?<br/><br/>Close enough to dip his fingers into the ridges<br/><br/>where oil paints hardened under an artist's gaze?<br/><br/>Close enough to breathe onto the blood lilies?<br/><br/>Ask him, why did he paint them red?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>He grinned like Carroll's cheshire cat.<br/><br/>"Through clouded and bloodshot eyes I imagine.<br/><br/>Be my waterlilies!" he says,<br/><br/>"Feel my breath and let my fingers delve,<br/><br/>become my masterpiece instead.<br/><br/>A brush has never touched a canvas as fine as your fair skin.<br/><br/>Let the masters weep in jealousy,<br/><br/>and Van Gogh slice his ear in envy at the beauty of your nakedness."(Jodah)<br/><br/>Self portrait with bandaged ear<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Responses<br/><br/>Now it's your turn. Please write your response in the comments below, remembering to check those immediately before yours for the last written stanza of the poem. If you do decide to write a separate hub for your stanza of verse, make sure you leave a link here in comments.<br/><br/>The Finished Masterpiece<br/><br/>All contributions have been received and I have put the finished poem together with only some slight edits. I hope everyone is happy with the result. If you think I could improve the order of stanzas etc, feel free to let me know.<br/><br/>Comments<br/><br/>Hey Diana, looks like I have to go add another stanza to the finished poem :)<br/><br/>Thanks for this contribution.Quite beautiful.<br/><br/>Diana L Pierce from Potter County, Pa. on September 19, 2015:<br/><br/>No tears splash water below,<br/><br/>From the bridge beneath his feet,<br/><br/>Nor can his brush paint his thoughts,<br/><br/>From the mystery maid he seeks.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 21, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Cris, I am sure everyone appreciates your comment.

(see link above comments)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 14, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, very well done. Thank you for joining in :) your stanza tells a great story in few words.

And the beauty we can still enjoy today from all his work.<br/><br/>This is a great challenge! I am really looking forward to adding to this.<br/><br/>I first wanted to stop in and let you know that, up for sure. Shared too.<br/><br/>And thank you so much for all the challenges to help the rest of us, keep our mental energy flowing and giving it a work out! You are the best.<br/><br/>The information about LuLu and the free ISBN number is an answered prayer! So, smile my friend. You are a gift!<br/><br/>Hugs. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Marj. I think I may have all the verses that are going to come. I have been doing my best to arrange them as I think best with just a little editing. I will probably post the finished poem as a separate hub with a link on this one to it. My book is available on Lulu and iBooks...there's a link on one of the earlier comments. I'd really appreciate it if you were to purhase a copy. Bear in mind it's my first eBook so the formatting etc isn't perfect, but it's taken me seven revisions I think to get it where it is. It will all be easier next time. If you need help let me know.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John, you have certainly had some excellent responses to your challenge - I'm sure you'll fuse it altogether beautifully although I imagine a difficult task. I'm interested in your poetry books also - I really have to get my act together technologically - I'll try and check it all out...cheers -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, both books 'On the Wings of Eagles" and "I Laughed a Smile" have mostly the same content...except the former has one extra poem. Originally they were in different formats, one ePub, the other PDF but now they are both ePub. They are available through Lulu and iBooks, soon Barnes and Noble and Nook (not Amazon). I may try publishing another book through Amazon soon just to see how it compares. Thanks again.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thanks a lot, the info on publishing with Lulu will be quite useful as I'm thinking of publishing but I'm currently torn between Amazon and Lulu. I wanted to purchase one of your books, but I couldn't seem to find them on Amazon. However, I'll probably get it from Lulu. Wishing you every success, you deserve it.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hey Phyllis, thanks for ontributing. I like it, a perfect ending to the poem I think.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, I think I have sorted out the poem satisfactorily. Just waiting to see if there is any more to add. Publishing with Lulu wasn't bad and now that I've done it once it will be easier next time. Getting the formatting to look right in the eBook was the hardest, though you and just type it in a word document and Lulu automatically produces the contents page and converts the document to ePub or PDF you can only use certain fonts and have to make sure the chapter names or poem titles are in Heading 1. They also provide a free ISBN number if you want. Overall it was easier than expected however.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, this is succinct and beautiful, I love it. Shyron's did an excellent job also, I thought I'd already commented on her verse, but I hadn't.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns from High desert of Nevada. on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Wonderful hub, great idea, Jodah. Here is one from me. Short but sweet. Hope it is okay:<br/><br/>And this the beauty be<br/><br/>From Masters past we see<br/><br/>Impressed upon the boy<br/><br/>Bestowed on her with joy<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks John and Jo. You are kind. Jo, you have always been a brilliant poet. I, too, am looking forward to the end result after John does his magic to pull it all together.<br/><br/>I will share again to see if there are any more takers.<br/><br/>Blessings<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Faith, beautifully done, I find it incredible how someone with such limited vision can teach us so much about beauty, light and shadows. John, looking forward to reading the end result.<br/><br/>By the way, congtats on publishing your poems. How did you find the process of publishing with Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for your great submission Faith. No it's not too late, I'm still compiling the final poem so it should be up for all to see in a day or two.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John,<br/><br/>I apologize for my late submission here to your wonderful challenge. I am off from work a couple of day and decided to give this a go while my husband is resting from knee surgery. If it does not meet with your standards, please feel free to not use it in your final poem or edit as you deem necessary.<br/><br/>Blessings always<br/><br/>Here it goes:<br/><br/>Confessions to friend Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>Of light encapsulating both torment, joy<br/><br/>Fervent madness in analyzing colors<br/><br/>Consequential spontaneous creations<br/><br/>Season after season of obsession<br/><br/>Capturing different hues in a single moment<br/><br/>Attentive while strolling in Argenteuill<br/><br/>Brushwork bares masterpiece.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 09, 2015:<br/><br/>Just a shout out to see if anyone else still wants to contribute to this chain poem. I have started compiling the stanzas together but will leave it open for a couple more days in case anyone else is intending to join in. Thanks to all who have contributed.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Genna. It appears Monet is a favourite arist of many here. I hope you'll take part in this challenge too :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you for a great contribution Shyron. This is a very nice verse. Well done.<br/><br/>Genna East from Massachusetts, USA on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John...<br/><br/>I started to read this wonderful challenge (Monet is one of my favorite artists), then came back to finish reading some of the beautiful contributions that give this painting a stunning voice through perception and the senses. What an exciting hub. :-)<br/><br/>Shyron E Shenko from Texas on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Following Jo (tobusiness)<br/><br/>"The pure white of the lily's skin<br/><br/>Speaks of no beauty from within<br/><br/>Just Monet's way or goal<br/><br/>For feasting eyes<br/><br/>Not feasting for the soul"<br/><br/>Shyron<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for returning Kim, I'm so pleased with the responses.

I'm so glad you like my contribution. This is a very good idea, I know you'll have fun putting it all together. Take care and my best to you.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Deb, yes I am impressed by the standard of submissions. I'm looking forward to putting it all together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Ann, it is good to see the poets among us take up the challenge with some great contributions so far. I just hope Imcan do it justice when it comes to putting it together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Well done Jo. The word "sublime" comes to mind. I hoped all the poets would rise to the fore, and they have. Love it, thanks for contributing.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt from Stillwater, OK on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>I am excited to see what you end up with here. There are a number of fine poets rising to the challenge, so go to it!<br/><br/>Ann Carr from SW England on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Great one, Jo!<br/><br/>You've got everyone going, John! Rather you than me, putting all this together, but it's going to be a humdinger of a poem when it finally comes to an end - if it ever does! You've really started something.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John here goes nothing! Following from Kim's. I hope it reads well.<br/><br/>And the boy began to walk away<br/><br/>But in his wake, I heard him say<br/><br/>"I took a trip to Orangerie<br/><br/>Where the ghost of Monet still abides<br/><br/>I sat right down and gazed awhile<br/><br/>Until I heard a soft voice cry.<br/><br/>"Have you ever seen a fluid dream?<br/><br/>Where light evolves into what it touch<br/><br/>Where serenity flows through cloudy veil<br/><br/>Where the magician's brush like lightening rush<br/><br/>Have you ever seen a sight sublime?<br/><br/>A child born of distorted illusion<br/><br/>This flowering pond that traps the light<br/><br/>That lift the heart and beckons the soul<br/><br/>An abstract pulchritude up close<br/><br/>Move back, behold; such tranquil delight."<br/><br/>I hope this is in line with what the others have done. Feel free to edit if needed. My best...<br/><br/>Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Alrighty!<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Jo, please do. Anyone is welcome to do more than one stanza. I may add another myself at some stage.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>John, I've decided to have a go, but it's about 16 lines, can I do it in two stanzas following on from Kim's wonderful submission? You can always edit it later.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, sorry to hear you are under the weather at the moment. I am not in a hurry to close this challenge so I'll keep it open until you are back firing on all cylinders and are able to contribute. You are one of the hubbers I was looking forward to getting a response from as I thought it would suit. Thank you for your kind words, and get well soon.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John I can't believe I almost missed your incredible challenged. This is something in which I would have loved to participate since Claude Monet is one of my all times favourite artist. Unfortunately, I must cry off. I'm a bit under the weather with a head full of cotton wool, or so it seems. If the challenge is still open when I get rid of this pesky flu I may give it a go, but I must say, the standard is exceptionally high. Maj took it to another level but all the submissions are brilliant. Kudos to you Andriealphus and the other writers who participated so far in this artistic and creative masterpiece.<br/><br/>My best always Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Maj, glad this poem inspired you, and yes it beats watching the cricket especially with the Aussie batsmen performing badly in this third test. It will be an interesting exercise for me to fuse all the stanzas together but should be good.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thank you, I'm most happy you like my offering. I found the poem intriguing and suddenly felt inspired to write my version in the same mode. I'm not sure I wrote a continuation from the stanza before (alwaysexploring) but I'm sure you will fuse it altogether when the time comes. Love all the responses. I haven't managed any creative writing for yonks, can't wait now to start over, just need some time. (beats watching the cricket too!!!) Cheers John, will be checking in -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for checking Dana. I am pleased with the quality of responses so far. I just have to wait and see how many more come in. The final,poem should be great.<br/><br/>Dana Tate from LOS ANGELES on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Just checking in to see how things are going, I can't wait for the finished product. I attended a poetry class and we did this also it was really fun.<br/><br/>ocfireflies from North Carolina on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Thanks so much for providing the platform for without that it is easy to fall down.<br/><br/>; ) Kim<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Devika.

"En İyi Şair 2014 ve 2021" Hubby Ödülleri'ne layık görüldü.<br/><br/>Madam Monet bir Japon kimonosunda, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Kamusal alan adı], Wikimedia Commons aracılığıyla<br/><br/>İşbirlikçi, Kolektif veya Zincirli Şiirin Kısa Tarihi<br/><br/>İşbirlikçi, kolektif veya zincir şiir, birden fazla kişi tarafından şiir yazmak için alternatif ve yaratıcı bir tekniktir. Bu tür şiirlerin temel amacı, çeşitli yazarların/şiirlerin işbirliği ile şiirler oluşturmak, bireysel seslerini korurken birleşik bir ses oluşturmaya çalışmaktır.<br/><br/>Japon şiirinde işbirliği örnekleri boldur. Bu tür birçok olayın kesin hesapları ve kayıtları ya kayıp ya da eksik olsa da.<br/><br/>Kolektif şiir yazımının en ünlü örneklerinden biri, Sürrealist Fransız şairler Andre Breton, Paul .luard ve Rene Char'ın Ralentir Travaux adlı şiir koleksiyonuydu. Bu üç şair, 1930'da sadece beş gün boyunca bu koleksiyondaki şiirleri yazmak için işbirliği yaptı.<br/><br/>1940'lar boyunca, Amerikalı bir şair olan Charles Henri Ford, her şairin bir satır yazdığı ve daha sonra şiiri dünyanın başka bir yerindeki bir başkasına (devam etmek için) posta yoluyla gönderdiği "zincir şiiri" olarak adlandırdığı şeyi icat etti.<br/><br/>2007 yılında Amerikan işbirlikçi şiirinin bir koleksiyonu Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry, Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton ve David Trinidad tarafından düzenlendi ve yayınlandı.<br/><br/>İşbirlikçi şiir yazma, okullarda ve kolejlerde öğrencilere takım çalışmasını öğretmek ve hangi yollarla bağlantı kurduklarını keşfetmek için kullanılmıştır.<br/><br/>Açık Havada Bir Şekil Çalışması: Sola bakan bir Şemsiyeli Kadın, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain veya Public domain], Wikimedia Commons aracılığıyla<br/><br/>Bu Makalenin Amacı ve Meydan Okumaya Nasıl Yaklaşılır<br/><br/>Birkaç yıl önce "Poem Without an End" adlı bir makale yazdım ve bu makaleye, kendimi eklenmeye ödünç veren bir Noel şiiri yazdım. O aşamada burada sadece birkaç takipçim olduğu için tepkiye hayran kaldım. İnsanlar, her biri bir önceki yorumcunun stanzasından devam etmek için hub'da "yorumlar" da bir şiir stanzası yazdı. Çok iyi çalıştı ve sonunda tüm katkıları hub'ın bir parçası olarak tek bir şiire derledim.<br/><br/>Frank Atanacio'nun "Spirits Sat as Mourners" adlı eseri de dahil olmak üzere çok başarılı olan benzer zorluklar ortaya çıktı. Aradaki fark, bu örnekte katkıda bulunanların kendi hub'larını şiirleri için yazmaları ve Frank'in orijinal hub'ına bir bağlantı yerleştirmeleridir.<br/><br/>Bu özel meydan okuma için, herkesin değerli zamanlarını tek bir şiir stanzası için ayrı merkezler yazarak geçirmesini beklemiyorum (gerçekten istemedikçe). Asıl sorun, etkili olması için, şiirin daha önce yazılmış kısımlarını hub'ınıza kopyalamanız ve muhtemelen "çiftleme" etiketiyle vurulmanız gerektiğidir.<br/><br/>Yani, bu durumda ve ayrıca her yerde link bırakmak zorunda kalmamak için, sadece katılmak isteyen herkesin "yorumlar" daki stanzalarını buraya yazmasını istiyorum. Meydan okumaya katkıda bulunan ve devam eden sizinkinden önceki son yorumu kontrol edin. Aynı stanzadan birden fazla takipçi görürsem, şiirsel lisansımı en iyi düşündüğüm şekilde çalışmak için kullanacağım.<br/><br/>Bir aşamada, yeterince stanzas eklendiğini hissettiğimde, muhtemelen meydan okumaya bir son vereceğim ve daha sonra hepsini makalenin bir parçası olarak tamamlanmış şiir olarak derleyeceğim (aynı zamanda her bir katılımcıya kredi veriyorum).<br/><br/>Çiçekli Nehirbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Kamusal alan adı], Wikimedia Commons aracılığıyla<br/><br/>Meydan okuma!<br/><br/>Şimdi ilginç kısım geliyor. Bu zincir şiir meydan okumasına katılırsanız, şiirin tarzını ve sesini önceki dizelere mümkün olduğunca yakın tutmaya çalışmanız gerekir, böylece bilgisiz okuyuculara sadece bir yazarın tüm şiiri yazdığı görünecektir.<br/><br/>Kulağa kolay geliyor, değil mi? Belki de şiirin geleneksel bir tarzı, kafiyesi veya metresi olsaydı olurdu. Ama bu değil! Ekleyeceğiniz şiir, başka bir yerde bir "zincir şiiri meydan okuması" olarak benim Andriealphus'umdan bir tanıdık tarafından başlatıldı. Yazarken bu meydan okumayı kabul eden tek kişi bendim ve konuyu sevdiğim için yazar arkadaşlarım için büyük bir meydan okuma olacağını düşündüm ve burada kullanmaya karar verdim ve cevabın daha iyi olup olmayacağını görmeye karar verdim. (Burada bu tarza uygun yazılar yazan birkaç şair tanıyorum)<br/><br/>Kurallar :<br/><br/>Yorumlarda önceki stanza'dan devam edin<br/><br/>Şiirin sesini ve tarzını korumaya çalışın<br/><br/>Stanza/verse'inizi öncekilerle yaklaşık olarak aynı uzunlukta tutun<br/><br/>Claude Monet, sanat tarihinin en ünlü ressamlarından biriydi ve Empresyonist hareketin önde gelen isimlerinden biriydi.<br/><br/>1883'te Monet Giverny'ye taşındı. Burada, yaratmaya yardım ettiği bahçelerde açık havada resim yapmayı severdi. Gölette bulunan su zambaklarının belirli bir çekiciliği vardı ve hayatının geri kalanında bunların birkaç serisini boyadı; Gölet üzerindeki Japon tarzı köprü de birkaç eserin konusu oldu.<br/><br/>1912'de Monet, Paris'te bir müze olan Orangerie des Tuileries tarafından yaptırılan 12 sulu resim serisini boyadı. Bunları çok büyük ölçekte yapmayı ve "barışçıl meditasyon" olarak hizmet etmeyi seçti. Bu proje Monet'nin sonraki yıllarının çoğunu tüketti. Monet bir keresinde "Bu su ve yansıma manzaraları benim için bir saplantı haline geldi. Yaşlı bir adam olarak gücümün ötesinde, ama yine de hissettiğimi yapmak istiyorum."<br/><br/>Sağlığı da artık bir engeldi. Neredeyse gözleri katarakttan ciddi şekilde etkilenen Monet, 1923'te rahatsızlık için ameliyat olmayı kabul etti.<br/><br/>Monet'nin ünlü su zambakları kataraktı ilerledikçe daha kırmızıya döndü. Düzeltici bir ameliyat geçirdikten sonra "kırmızı zambak" resimlerinin çoğunu yok etti, kimsenin ona gerçekten bahsetmemesine kızdı. İronik olarak, bu resimler muhtemelen izlenimci tarzını o dönemde bu kadar ünlü yapan şeydi - sanatçılar bu noktada renk ve benzeri ile daha fazla risk almaya başladılar. (kaynak: biography.com)<br/><br/>Masterpiece<br/><br/>"Arkanda oturan çocuk şaheser gibi göründüğünü söylüyor.<br/><br/>Sor ona, hiç Monet'i yakından görmüş mü?<br/><br/>Otlu göl kıyısının çamurlu vuruşlarından başka bir şey göremeyecek kadar yakın mı?<br/><br/>Parmaklarını sırtlara sokacak kadar yakın.<br/><br/>Yağ boyalarının bir sanatçının bakışları altında sertleştiği yer?<br/><br/>Kan zambaklarına nefes alacak kadar yakın mı?<br/><br/>Ona sor, neden onları kırmızıya boyadı?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>Carroll'un cheshire kedisi gibi sırıttı.<br/><br/>"Bulutlu ve kanlı gözlerle hayal ediyorum.<br/><br/>Suyum ol!" der.<br/><br/>"Nefesimi hisset ve parmaklarımın açılmasına izin ver,<br/><br/>Onun yerine benim şaheserim ol.<br/><br/>Bir fırça asla bir tuvale senin güzel cildin kadar güzel dokunmamıştır.<br/><br/>Efendiler kıskançlık içinde ağlasın,<br/><br/>Ve Van Gogh, çıplaklığının güzelliğine gıpta ederek kulağını keser."

Sadece küçük bir düzenleme ile en iyi düşündüğüm gibi onları düzenlemek için elimden geleni yapıyorum. Muhtemelen bitmiş şiiri, bununla ilgili bir bağlantıya sahip ayrı bir hub olarak yayınlayacağım. Kitabım Lulu ve iBooks'ta mevcut ... daha önceki yorumlardan birinde bir bağlantı var. Bir kopyasını aratırsanız gerçekten memnun olurum. İlk e-kitabım olduğunu unutmayın, bu yüzden biçimlendirme vb mükemmel değildir, ancak onu olduğu yere götürmek için düşündüğüm yedi revizyon aldı. Bir dahaki sefere her şey daha kolay olacak.

Başlangıçta farklı formatlardaydılar, bir ePub, diğer PDF ama şimdi ikisi de ePub. Lulu ve iBooks aracılığıyla kullanılabilirler, yakında Barnes ve Noble ve Nook (Amazon değil). Nasıl karşılaştırdığını görmek için yakında Amazon aracılığıyla başka bir kitap yayınlamayı deneyebilirim. Tekrar teşekkürler.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues, 11 Ağustos 2015 tarihinde Lincolnshire, İngiltere'den:<br/><br/>John, çok teşekkürler, Lulu ile yayıncılık hakkında bilgi yayınlamayı düşündüğüm için oldukça yararlı olacak ama şu anda Amazon ve Lulu arasında yırtıldım.

Sana her başarıyı diliyorum, bunu hak ediyorsun.<br/><br/>Gondwana Land'den John Hansen (yazar) 11 Ağustos 2015'te:<br/><br/>Hey Phyllis, bunu önerdiğin için teşekkürler.

Ekleyecek başka bir şey olup olmadığını görmek için bekliyorum. Lulu ile yayıncılık kötü değildi ve şimdi bir dahaki sefere daha kolay olacak. E-Kitapta doğru bakmak için biçimlendirmeyi almak en zoruydu, ancak siz ve sadece bir kelime belgesine yazın ve Lulu otomatik olarak içerik sayfasını üretir ve belgeyi ePub veya PDF'ye dönüştürür, yalnızca belirli yazı tiplerini kullanabilir ve bölüm adlarının veya şiir başlıklarının Başlık 1'de olduğundan emin olmanız gerekir. Ayrıca isterseniz ücretsiz bir ISBN numarası da sağlarlar. Ancak genel olarak beklenenden daha kolaydı.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues, 11 Ağustos 2015 tarihinde Lincolnshire, İngiltere'den:<br/><br/>Phyllis, bu kısa ve güzel, çok seviyorum.

Gerçekten bir şey başlattın.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues, Lincolnshire, Birleşik Krallık, 01 Ağustos 2015 tarihinde:<br/><br/>Tamam, John burada hiçbir şey yok! Kim'in ardından. Umarım iyi okur.<br/><br/>Ve çocuk yürümeye başladı.<br/><br/>Ama onun ardından, onun dediğini duydum.<br/><br/>"Orangerie'ye bir geziye çıktım.<br/><br/>Monet'nin hayaletinin hala dayandığı yer<br/><br/>Oturdum ve bir süre baktım.<br/><br/>Ta ki yumuşak bir sesin ağlamasını duyana kadar.<br/><br/>"Hiç akıcı bir rüya gördün mü?<br/><br/>Işığın dokunduğu şeye evrimleştiği yer<br/><br/>Huzurun bulutlu örtüden aktığı yer<br/><br/>Sihirbazın fırçalarının ışık saçan bir acele gibi olduğu yerde<br/><br/>Hiç yüce bir manzara gördün mü?<br/><br/>Bozulmuş yanılsamadan doğan bir çocuk<br/><br/>Işığı yakalayan bu çiçekli gölet<br/><br/>Kalbi kaldıran ve ruhu çağıran<br/><br/>Yakına soyut bir pulkrasyon<br/><br/>Geri çekilin, işte böyle sakin bir zevk."<br/><br/>Umarım bu diğerlerinin yaptıklarıyla uyumludur.

Daha sonra her zaman düzenleyebilirsiniz.<br/><br/>Gondwana Land'den John Hansen (yazar) 31 Temmuz 2015'te:<br/><br/>Merhaba Jo, şu anda hava altında olduğunu duyduğuma üzüldüm. Bu meydan okumayı kapatmak için acelem yok, bu yüzden tüm silindirlere ateş edene ve katkıda bulunabilene kadar açık tutacağım. Ben uygun olacağını düşündüm gibi bir cevap almak için sabırsızlanıyordum Hubbers birisiniz. Nazik sözler için teşekkür ederim, ve yakında iyi olsun.<br/><br/>31 Temmuz 2015 tarihinde Lincolnshire, İngiltere'den Jo Alexis-Hagues:<br/><br/>Vay canına! John, inanılmaz meydan okumanı neredeyse kaçırdığıma inanamıyorum. Claude Monet tüm zamanların en sevdiğim sanatçılarından biri olduğu için katılmak istediğim bir şey. Ne yazık ki, ağlamak zorundayım. Pamuk yünü dolu bir kafayla havanın biraz altındayım, ya da öyle görünüyor. Eğer bu sinir bozucu gripten kurtulduğumda meydan okuma hala açıksa, ona bir şans verebilirim, ama söylemeliyim ki, standart son derece yüksek.

Şiiri ilgi çekici buldum ve aniden aynı modda kendi versiyonumu yazmak için ilham aldım. Daha önce stanza'dan bir devam yazdığımdan emin değilim (her zaman keşif) ama zaman geldiğinde bunu tamamen kaynaştıracağınızdan eminim. Tüm yanıtları seviyorum. Yonks için herhangi bir yaratıcı yazı yönetmedim, yeniden başlamak için şimdi sabırsızlanıyorum, sadece biraz zamana ihtiyacım var. (kriketi de izliyor!) Şerefe John, giriş yapacak -<br/><br/>John Hansen (yazar) 30 Temmuz 2015 tarihinde Gondwana Land'den:<br/><br/>Dana'yı kontrol ettiğiniz için teşekkürler. Şimdiye kadar verilen yanıtların kalitesinden memnunum. Sadece beklemem ve kaç tane daha geldiğini görmem gerekiyor. Final, şiir harika olmalı.<br/><br/>30 Temmuz 2015'te Los Angeles'tan Dana Tate:<br/><br/>Sadece işlerin nasıl gittiğini görmek için kontrol ediyorum, bitmiş ürün için sabırsızlanıyorum. Bir şiir dersine katıldım ve bunu da yaptık, gerçekten eğlenceliydi.<br/><br/>29 Temmuz 2015'te Kuzey Carolina'dan ocfireflies:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Bu olmadan platformu sağladığınız için çok teşekkür ederim, düşmek kolaydır.<br/><br/>; ) Kim<br/><br/>29 Temmuz 2015'te Gondwana Land'den John Hansen (yazar):<br/><br/>Teşekkür ederim Devika, seni bir süredir görmedim, umarım her şey yolundadır.<br/><br/>29 Temmuz 2015'te Gondwana Land'den John Hansen (yazar):<br/><br/>Güzel iş Kim. Sen GIverny sorusuna cevap olarak Maj mükemmel takip edecek.

| First of all EEQT itself needs to be further developed in order to provide a theoretical and computational answer to the needs of modern quantum engineering<br/>and technology. We need to include classical systems with infinite<br/>numbers of degrees of freedom - like electromagnetic and/or gravitational<br/>field. We also need to include infinite quantum systems so as<br/>to understand and simulate Bose gas and its phase transitions. But, there<br/>are also steps that must be taken far beyond the paradigm of EEQT.<br/>As we have emphasized so many times: quantum theory has yet<br/>to be understood in terms of a "non-linear classical theory." But what we mean by a "classical theory" is something much more advanced and more<br/>general than clasical mechanics or classical field theory. By a "classical theory" we mean first of all, a theory that is not based<br/>on probabilities from the start; a theory in which probabilities appear at a<br/>later stage, derived from the theory; derived perhaps, in a necessary way. Such a theory must not only specify the mathematical objects and their relations but also make "predictions".<br/>A classical theory is, in particular, a theory in which discrete events can happen, events that are "objective." They may be events that affect mainly the physical stratum, but they may be also "mental<br/>events," changes of states of "consciousness;" whatever they are, even if they<br/>are concerned with branchings of universes, - they DO HAPPEN.<br/>Such a theory, encompassing the quantum theory as we know it today,<br/>does not yet exist, but we can envisage its possible shape. Nothing serves better than an example, so let us give here an example of how<br/>such a theory can be construed.<br/>Imagine a theory developed a'la Einstein's unified field theory, but<br/>with variable metric signature, possibly with a complex causal web, multiple<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (see also [41]) bridges,<br/>time loops, nondifferrentiability, fractal structure, all of that additionally complicated by variable dimensionality of space and of "time" (cf [42]. Imagine such a theory to be able to accomodate all the four fundamental<br/>forces known to us, but it also involves an extra field, which is different<br/>from physical fields, and which is non-local in the sense that it does not<br/>survive taking a macro-average-limit when causal space-time<br/>structure of Einstein's general relativity is recovered. This extra field<br/>would be a place for "thought forms" and our theory would couple these<br/>thought forms to more "physical" levels of reality. The very concept of<br/>"time" would arise only in one particular limiting structure. Nothing<br/>prevents a theory of such a type to have mathematical structures rich enough to accomodate consciousness and mind. Due to its complexity,<br/>density of time-loops, bubble-like causal structure, making predictions<br/>in such theory is possible only by applying probability -<br/>as it is the case with systems evolving according to deterministic<br/>but chaotic dynamics. Quantum wave function would emerge in such a<br/>theory as an effective way of predicting. That type of explanation<br/>of quantum indeterminism was postulated long ago by I. J. Good. In<br/>[3] he speculated that<br/>quantum indeterminism can be understood if we admit that individual quantum events that actually happen here and now have future<br/>advanced causes as well has past retarded causes.<br/>A glimpse of such a thought<br/>may have occured to Alan Turing when he wrote his famous, already quoted sentence: "prediction must be linear, description must be nonlinear."<br/>A theory going partially in this direction is being developed by L. Nottale<br/>[43] who states the observation, attributed to Feynman, that "the typical paths of quantum mechanical particles are continuous non-differentiable." Then he continues his development of fractal<br/>space-time ideas to conclude with: "The quantum behavior becomes, in this theory,<br/>a manifestation of the fractal geometry of space-time, in the same way gravitation is, in Einstein's theory of general (motion-)relativity, a manifestation of the curvature of space-time.<br/>Another step in this direction comes from the work of Russian scientists - which started with the most original ideas of N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>and A. Sakharov [45], and is being developed in Moscow, the Urals and Siberia, see e.g. [46, 47, 48]. | Her şeyden önce, modern kuantum mühendisliği ve teknolojisinin ihtiyaçlarına teorik ve hesaplamalı bir cevap sağlamak için EEQT'nin kendisinin daha da geliştirilmesi gerekiyor. Elektromanyetik ve/veya yerçekimsel alan gibi sonsuz sayıda özgürlüğe sahip klasik sistemleri dahil etmemiz gerekiyor. Bose gazını ve faz geçişlerini anlamak ve simüle etmek için sonsuz kuantum sistemlerini de dahil etmemiz gerekiyor. Ancak, EEQT paradigmasının çok ötesine geçilmesi gereken adımlar da vardır.<br/>Birçok kez vurguladığımız gibi: kuantum teorisi henüz bir "doğrusal olmayan klasik teori" açısından anlaşılamamıştır. Ama bir "klasik teori" ile kastettiğimiz şey, klasik alan teorisinden çok daha gelişmiş ve daha genel bir şeydir. Bir "klasik teori" ile her şeyden önce, başlangıçtan itibaren olasılıklara dayanmayan bir teoriyi kastediyoruz; olasılıkların daha sonraki bir aşamada ortaya çıktığı, teoriden türetilen bir teori; belki de gerekli bir şekilde türetilmiştir. Böyle bir teori sadece matematiksel nesneleri ve ilişkilerini belirtmekle kalmamalı, aynı zamanda "önyargılar" da yapmalıdır.<br/>Klasik bir teori, özellikle, ayrık olayların gerçekleşebileceği bir teoridir, "nesnel" olan olaylardır. Bunlar çoğunlukla fiziksel tabakayı etkileyen olaylar olabilir, ancak aynı zamanda "zihinsel olaylar", "bilinç" durumlarının değişiklikleri de olabilir; her ne iseler, evrenlerin dallanmalarıyla ilgili olsalar bile, HAPPEN.<br/>Bugün bildiğimiz kuantum teorisini kapsayan böyle bir teori henüz mevcut değildir, ancak olası şeklini öngörebiliriz. Hiçbir şey bir örnekten daha iyi hizmet edemez, bu yüzden burada böyle bir teorinin nasıl yorumlanabileceğine dair bir örnek verelim.<br/>Bir teorinin a'la Einstein'ın birleşik alan teorisini geliştirdiğini düşünün, ancak değişken metrik imza ile, muhtemelen karmaşık bir nedensel ağ ile, çoklu<br/>Einstein-Rosen [41] köprüler, zaman döngüleri, diferansiyel olmayan, fraktal yapı, tüm bunlar uzayın ve "zamanın" değişken boyutsallığı ile ek olarak karmaşık (cf [42]). Böyle bir teorinin, bizim bildiğimiz dört temel kuvveti barındırabileceğini hayal edin, ama aynı zamanda, fiziksel alanlardan farklı olan ve Einstein'ın genel göreliliğinin nedensel uzay-zaman yapısı geri kazanıldığında makro-ortalama-sınır alarak hayatta kalamayacağı anlamında yerel olmayan ekstra bir alan içerir. Bu ekstra alan "düşünce formları" için bir yer olurdu ve teorimiz bu düşünce formlarını gerçekliğin daha "fiziksel" seviyelerine çiftleştirirdi.<br/>"Zaman" sadece belirli bir sınırlayıcı yapıda ortaya çıkar. Hiçbir şey, böyle bir tipteki bir teorinin, bilinci ve zihni barındıracak kadar zengin matematiksel yapılara sahip olmasını engellemez. Karmaşıklığı, zaman döngülerinin yoğunluğu, kabarcık benzeri nedensel yapı nedeniyle, böyle bir teoride tahminlerde bulunmak ancak olasılık uygulanarak mümkündür -<br/>deterministik ama kaotik dinamiklere göre gelişen sistemlerde olduğu gibi. Kuantum dalga fonksiyonu etkili bir tahmin yöntemi olarak böyle bir teoride ortaya çıkacaktı. Kuantum determinizminin bu tür açıklaması uzun zaman önce I. J. Good tarafından öne sürülmüştür.<br/>[3] Kuantum determinizminin aslında burada gerçekleşen ve şimdi gelecekteki gelişmiş nedenlere sahip olan bireysel kuantum olaylarının geçmiş gecikmeli nedenlere sahip olduğunu kabul edersek anlaşılabileceğini tahmin etti.<br/>Böyle bir düşünceye bir bakış Alan Turing'in ünlü, zaten alıntılanmış cümlesini yazdığında olmuş olabilir: "prediksiyon doğrusal olmalı, açıklama doğrusal olmamalıdır."<br/>Bu yönde kısmen devam eden bir teori L. Nottale tarafından geliştirilmektedir.<br/>Feynman'a atfedilen gözlemi belirten [43], "kuantum mekanik parçacıklarının tipik yolları sürekli olarak farklılaşamaz." Daha sonra fraktal uzay-zaman fikirlerini geliştirmeye devam ederek şu sonuca varır: "Kuantum davranışı, bu teoride, uzay-zamanın fraktal geometrisinin bir tezahürü olur, aynı şekilde çekim, Einstein'ın genel (hareket-) görelilik teorisinde, uzay-zamanın eğriliğinin bir tezahürüdür.<br/>Bu yöndeki bir başka adım, N.A. Kozyrev'in en orijinal fikirleriyle başlayan Rus bilim adamlarının çalışmalarından gelir [44].<br/>ve A. Sakharov [45] ve Moskova, Urallar ve Sibirya'da geliştirilmektedir, bkz. [46, 47, 48]. |
| Best Nutrition And Exercise For Lose Weight<br/><br/>How is breakfast really healthy?<br/><br/>In the morning like an emperor, at noon like a king, in the evening like a beggar – goes a well-known proverb. A study by the medical organization Endocrine Society confirms the key message behind the saying: It shows that breakfast plays a more important role than is often assumed. In the morning, the human body actually has more than twice as high a metabolic activity as at other times of the day: A large breakfast not only keeps you full for a long time, blood sugar and insulin levels also rise slowly. The appetite for sweets is regulated, we eat snacks less often during the day. Therefore, breakfast should not be skipped even during a diet.<br/><br/>Of course, having a big breakfast doesn't mean that we should have several croissants with nut nougat cream and sweet breakfast pancakes in the morning. Breakfast is healthy best when it is high in protein and fiber, as well as providing vitamins and minerals. Whole grain bread or muesli, oat flakes, fruits and nuts are energy suppliers that are good for you and keep you full for a long time.<br/><br/>The fact that a large breakfast is better than a large dinner does not necessarily mean that breakfast is essential for losing weight. A meta-analysis carried out in 2019 showed, that the total daily energy intake of people who eat breakfast is on average higher, than that of those who do not have breakfast. The latter were on average just under half a kilo lighter. So, according to the results of this major study, you don't necessarily have to eat breakfast if you want to lose weight.<br/><br/>Lose weight with the right diet – that's how easy it is to put healthy on your plate<br/><br/>Eating healthy in no way means less taste. Fresh vegetables, fish or meat as protein sources and other healthy ingredients conjure up taste in the pot and a smile on your lips – ideally also when you step on the scales. A US study has shown that people who cook their own food and consciously deal with what they eat have a body mass index in the normal range. Restaurant visits or fast food, on the other hand, quickly lure you into the sugar trap: Often there is no indication of how much sugar is in salad dressings, how much fat the potatoes were fried in or whether the meat was not treated.<br/><br/>A healthy lunch consists of three parts – the largest part is fruits or vegetables and should cover half of the plate. A quarter of the meal should consist of protein, i.e. fish, meat or tofu. The remaining quarter consists of carbohydrates and is ideally made from whole grain products. Important: Don't eat at your desk in the office, but stimulate your metabolism and ideally take a short walk before or after lunch.<br/><br/>When should you eat to lose weight?<br/><br/>In the evening, you should focus on light meals that are rather low in carbohydrates. These are the least likely to cause insulin to skyrocket, which is good for our body. Vegetables, dairy products and nuts, for example, are well suited for this.<br/><br/>You should also be careful not to have dinner too late. It is best to have eaten until 7 p.m. – then the body can relax and prepare for the night. Sufficient sleep is important for healthy weight loss. A US study found that people who slept about eight hours a night had better fat deposits. So good night! Allow yourself more than six hours of sleep so that you can start the next day fit and refreshed.<br/><br/>Losing weight without exercise – is it really possible?<br/><br/>It would be so easy, if the dream weight could be achieved simply by lowering the calorie intake. But you probably know the wisdom that diet is only one side of the coin and exercise is the other. So nothing helps: Put on your sportswear and off you go!<br/><br/>Anyone who, in addition to the sports program such as jogging, walking or swimming, also lets the elevator go alone and takes the stairs, takes a little detour or uses the bike instead of the car, is doing wellis also called something good. Even simple walking is good for health. | Kilo Vermek İçin En İyi Beslenme ve Egzersiz<br/><br/>Kahvaltı gerçekten sağlıklı mı?<br/><br/>Sabahları bir imparator gibi, öğlenleri bir kral gibi, akşamları bir dilenci gibi - iyi bilinen bir atasözü gider. Tıp kuruluşu Endokrin Derneği tarafından yapılan bir araştırma, şu sözün arkasındaki önemli mesajı doğrulamaktadır: Kahvaltının çoğu zaman varsayıldığından daha önemli bir rol oynadığını göstermektedir. Sabahları, insan vücudu aslında günün diğer zamanlarında olduğu gibi metabolik aktivitenin iki katından daha fazla yüksekliğe sahiptir: Büyük bir kahvaltı sizi uzun süre dolu tutmakla kalmaz, kan şekeri ve insülin seviyeleri de yavaş yavaş yükselir. Tatlılar için iştah düzenlenir, gün boyunca daha az sıklıkta atıştırmalıklar yeriz. Bu nedenle, bir diyet sırasında bile kahvaltı atlanmamalıdır.<br/><br/>Tabii ki, büyük bir kahvaltı yapmak, sabahları nut nugat kreması ve tatlı kahvaltı krepleri ile birkaç kruvasan yememiz gerektiği anlamına gelmez. Kahvaltı, protein ve lif bakımından yüksek olmasının yanı sıra vitamin ve mineraller sağladığında en sağlıklı olanıdır. Tam tahıllı ekmek veya müsli, yulaf gevreği, meyve ve fındık sizin için iyi olan ve sizi uzun süre dolu tutan enerji tedarikçileridir.<br/><br/>Büyük bir kahvaltının büyük bir akşam yemeğinden daha iyi olması, mutlaka kahvaltının kilo vermek için gerekli olduğu anlamına gelmez. 2019'da gerçekleştirilen bir meta-analiz, kahvaltı yapan kişilerin toplam günlük enerji alımının kahvaltı yapmayanlarınkinden ortalama daha yüksek olduğunu gösterdi. İkincisi ortalama yarım kilo daha hafifti. Bu nedenle, bu büyük çalışmanın sonuçlarına göre, kilo vermek istiyorsanız mutlaka kahvaltı yapmak zorunda değilsiniz.<br/><br/>Doğru diyetle kilo verin – tabağınıza sağlıklı koymak bu kadar kolay<br/><br/>Hiçbir şekilde sağlıklı beslenmek daha az tat anlamına gelmez. Taze sebzeler, protein kaynakları ve diğer sağlıklı bileşenler olarak balık veya et, tencerede tat ve dudaklarınızda bir gülümseme uyandırır - ideal olarak teraziye bastığınızda da. Bir ABD çalışması, kendi yiyeceklerini pişiren ve bilinçli olarak yedikleriyle ilgilenen insanların normal aralıkta bir vücut kitle indeksine sahip olduğunu göstermiştir. Restoran ziyaretleri veya fast food, diğer yandan, sizi hızla şeker tuzağına çeker: Genellikle salata soslarında ne kadar şeker olduğuna, patateslerin ne kadar yağda kızartıldığına veya etin tedavi edilip edilmediğine dair bir belirti yoktur.<br/><br/>Sağlıklı bir öğle yemeği üç bölümden oluşur - en büyük kısmı meyve veya sebzedir ve tabağın yarısını kaplamalıdır. Yemeğin dörtte biri protein, yani balık, et veya tofudan oluşmalıdır. Kalan çeyrek karbonhidratlardan oluşur ve ideal olarak tam tahıl ürünlerinden yapılır. Önemli: Ofisteki masanızda yemek yemeyin, ancak metabolizmanızı teşvik edin ve ideal olarak öğle yemeğinden önce veya sonra kısa bir yürüyüş yapın.<br/><br/>Kilo vermek için ne zaman yemek yemelisiniz?<br/><br/>Akşamları, karbonhidratlarda oldukça düşük olan hafif yemeklere odaklanmalısınız. Bunlar, insülinin vücudumuz için iyi olan fırlamasına neden olma olasılığı en düşüktür. Sebzeler, süt ürünleri ve fındıklar, örneğin, bunun için çok uygundur.<br/><br/>Ayrıca çok geç akşam yemeği yememeye dikkat etmelisiniz. Akşam 7'ye kadar yemek yemek en iyisidir - o zaman vücut rahatlayabilir ve geceye hazırlanabilir. Sağlıklı kilo kaybı için yeterli uyku önemlidir. Bir ABD çalışması, gece yaklaşık sekiz saat uyuyan insanların daha iyi yağ birikintilerine sahip olduğunu buldu. Bu yüzden iyi geceler! Kendinize altı saatten fazla uyku izni verin, böylece ertesi güne zinde ve yenilenmiş olarak başlayabilirsiniz.<br/><br/>Egzersiz yapmadan kilo vermek - gerçekten mümkün mü?<br/><br/>Bu çok kolay olurdu, rüya ağırlığı sadece kalori alımını azaltarak elde edilebilir olsaydı. Ama muhtemelen diyet sikkenin sadece bir tarafı ve egzersiz diğer olduğunu bilgelik biliyorum. Yani hiçbir şey yardımcı olur: Spor kıyafetini giy ve git!<br/><br/>Koşu, yürüyüş veya yüzme gibi spor programına ek olarak asansörün tek başına gitmesine ve merdivenlere çıkmasına izin veren, biraz dolambaçlı yol alan veya araba yerine bisiklet kullanan herkes, iyi bir şey olarak da adlandırılır. Basit yürüyüş bile sağlık için iyidir. |
| Why We Open Sourced the Anvil App Server<br/><br/>Why Open Source?<br/><br/>A little while ago, we open-sourced the Anvil App Server. The community reaction has been great, even a little overwhelming (yes, every reply to that announcement really did land in my inbox!). We've already incorporated a bunch of that feedback into our version 1.2 release. But we keep getting asked, " Why did you open-source such a core part of your product? "<br/><br/>Why do this at all?<br/><br/>Anvil is a tool that makes it as simple as possible to build a web app. We do that by enabling you to build the whole application in one language, Python.<br/><br/>Simple hosting is part of that.<br/><br/>The web platform is broken , and Anvil is our attempt to fix it. And, because there is so much complexity in deploying a web app, a cloud-hosted service was the best way to provide the simplicity we want. That way, you can build your app in the Anvil Editor, and make it live on the Internet with one click.<br/><br/>But we kept hearing from people who said, "that's great, but…"<br/><br/>"…but I need to run this on an offshore platform without reliable internet access"<br/><br/>"…but I want to package my app into an IoT device I sell"<br/><br/>or simply, "…but if I'm putting my eggs in this basket, how can I be sure I can still run my app in ten years' time?"<br/><br/>These are all good points! A cloud service isn't the right solution for everyone. If we want to serve these users, there's got to be some way for them to get their apps out of Anvil and run them locally, under their own complete control.<br/><br/>Open Source: Escape hatch, not an ejector seat<br/><br/>We believe in escape hatches, not ejector seats. At conferences, we sometimes get asked, "can I export this as a Flask+JS app?". Sure, it would be possible – we could generate a server package, compile the client-side Python to Javascript, and spit out a classic web app. But it would have serious drawbacks, because:<br/><br/>Not a comfy ride.<br/><br/>Code generation is an ejector seat. Generated code is better than nothing – at least you can edit it! But the moment you edit that code, you lose all the benefits of the system that generated it. If you're using Anvil because of its drag-and-drop editor and Python in the browser, why should our locally-hosted users have to use vim and Javascript?<br/><br/>So we did it the right way: we open-sourced Anvil's runtime engine. It's the same code that serves your app in our hosted service, and it represents your app the same way. You can edit your code with a text editor, run it, then git push it back into our online IDE. It's not an ejector seat: there's no explosive transition. It's an escape hatch: you can climb out, and climb right back in.<br/><br/>What about our business model?<br/><br/>Anvil was never meant to be one of those enterprise low-code systems that charge you $20/mo for each person who uses your app. Anvil is a developer tool. The apps you develop are yours. Enabling you to run them on a Raspberry Pi is cool, but it doesn't change our business model.<br/><br/>We're doing what we always were: We make and sell a development tool that makes it drastically simpler to build web applications. We provide hosting for Anvil apps. We offer the entire development-and-hosting platform on-site for enterprise customers. And, of course, we offer a free plan so that everyone can use Anvil for hobby or educational purposes – or to start building something and see how it goes.<br/><br/>We've open-sourced the Anvil App Server for the (relatively small) number of people who need it, and to provide the ultimate insurance policy. Sure, you can build an app with vim and host it yourself, without even registering an account with us (we've got docs to show you how!). But the Anvil Editor is the world's easiest way to build a web app, and our hosted service is the easiest way to deploy it – so that's what we expect most of our users to continue doing. And you can build with confidence, knowing that the open-source code is right there if you need it.<br/><br/>Try it yourself<br/><br/>If our development philosophy resonates with you, why not try Anvil yourself? | Neden Anvil App Server'ı Açtık<br/><br/>Neden Açık Kaynak?<br/><br/>Kısa bir süre önce, Anvil App Server'ı açtık. Topluluk tepkisi büyük, hatta biraz ezici oldu (evet, bu duyuruya verilen her cevap gerçekten gelen kutuma indi!). Bu geri bildirimin bir kısmını sürüm 1.2 sürümümüze zaten dahil ettik. Ama sürekli olarak "Ürününüzün bu kadar temel bir kısmını neden açtınız?" diye soruluyoruz.<br/><br/>Bunu neden yapıyorsun?<br/><br/>Anvil, bir web uygulaması oluşturmayı mümkün olduğunca basitleştiren bir araçtır. Bunu, tüm uygulamayı tek bir dilde, Python'da oluşturmanızı sağlayarak yapıyoruz.<br/><br/>Basit hosting bunun bir parçasıdır.<br/><br/>Web platformu bozuldu ve Anvil bunu düzeltme girişimimiz. Ve, bir web uygulamasını dağıtmada çok fazla karmaşıklık olduğu için, bulut barındırılan bir hizmet istediğimiz sadeliği sağlamanın en iyi yoluydu. Bu şekilde, uygulamanızı Anvil Editor'de oluşturabilir ve tek bir tıklamayla internette canlı hale getirebilirsiniz.<br/><br/>Ama "bu harika, ama..." diyen insanlardan haber aldık.<br/><br/>"...ama bunu güvenilir internet erişimi olmayan bir offshore platformunda çalıştırmam gerekiyor"<br/><br/>"...ama uygulamamı sattığım bir IoT cihazına paketlemek istiyorum"<br/><br/>ya da basitçe, "...ama yumurtalarımı bu sepete koyuyorsam, uygulamamı on yıl içinde hala çalıştırabileceğimden nasıl emin olabilirim?"<br/><br/>Bunların hepsi iyi noktalar! Bir bulut hizmeti herkes için doğru çözüm değildir. Bu kullanıcılara hizmet etmek istiyorsak, uygulamalarını Anvil'den çıkarmanın ve yerel olarak çalıştırmanın bir yolu olmalı, kendi tam kontrolleri altında.<br/><br/>Açık Kaynak: Kaçış kapağı, bir fırlatma koltuğu değil<br/><br/>Kaçış kapaklarına inanıyoruz, fırlatma koltuklarına değil. Konferanslarda bazen "Bunu bir Flask + JS uygulaması olarak dışa aktarabilir miyim?" diye soruyoruz. Elbette, bu mümkün olurdu - bir sunucu paketi oluşturabilir, istemci tarafı Python'u Javascript'e derleyebilir ve klasik bir web uygulamasını tükürebiliriz. Ancak ciddi dezavantajları olurdu, çünkü:<br/><br/>Rahat bir yolculuk değil.<br/><br/>Kod oluşturma bir itici koltuktur. Oluşturulan kod hiç yoktan iyidir - en azından düzenleyebilirsiniz! Ancak bu kodu düzenlediğiniz anda, onu oluşturan sistemin tüm faydalarını kaybedersiniz. Tarayıcıdaki sürükle-bırak editörü ve Python nedeniyle Anvil kullanıyorsanız, yerel olarak barındırılan kullanıcılarımız neden vim ve Javascript kullanmak zorunda?<br/><br/>Bu yüzden doğru şekilde yaptık: Anvil'in çalışma zamanı motorunu açtık. Uygulamanıza barındırılan hizmetimizde hizmet veren aynı koddur ve uygulamanızı aynı şekilde temsil eder. Kodunuzu bir metin editörü ile düzenleyebilir, çalıştırabilir, ardından çevrimiçi IDE'mize geri itebilirsiniz. Bu bir itici koltuk değil: patlayıcı geçiş yok. Bu bir kaçış kapağı: dışarı tırmanabilir ve hemen içeri tırmanabilirsiniz.<br/><br/>Peki ya iş modelimiz?<br/><br/>Anvil, hiçbir zaman uygulamanızı kullanan her kişi için 20 $ / mo ücret alan düşük kodlu sistemlerden biri değildi. Anvil bir geliştirici aracıdır. Geliştirdiğiniz uygulamalar sizindir. Onları bir Raspberry Pi'de çalıştırmanızı sağlamak harika, ancak iş modelimizi değiştirmiyor.<br/><br/>Her zaman olduğumuz şeyi yapıyoruz: Web uygulamaları oluşturmayı çok daha basit hale getiren bir geliştirme aracı yapıyoruz ve satıyoruz. Anvil uygulamalarına ev sahipliği yapıyoruz. Kurumsal müşteriler için tüm geliştirme ve barındırma platformunu yerinde sunuyoruz. Ve elbette, herkesin Anvil'i hobi veya eğitim amaçlı kullanabilmesi için ücretsiz bir plan sunuyoruz - ya da bir şeyler inşa etmeye başlamak ve nasıl gittiğini görmek için.<br/><br/>İhtiyacı olan (nispeten az) sayıda insan için ve nihai sigorta poliçesini sağlamak için Anvil App Server'ı açtık. Elbette, vim ile bir uygulama oluşturabilir ve bizimle bir hesap bile kaydetmeden kendiniz barındırabilirsiniz (nasıl olduğunu gösterecek doktorlarımız var!). Ancak Anvil Editor, bir web uygulaması oluşturmanın en kolay yoludur ve barındırılan hizmetimiz bunu dağıtmanın en kolay yoludur - bu nedenle kullanıcılarımızın çoğunun yapmaya devam etmesini bekliyoruz. Ve eğer ihtiyacınız olursa, açık kaynak kodunun orada olduğunu bilerek güvenle inşa edebilirsiniz.<br/><br/>Kendin dene.<br/><br/>Eğer gelişim felsefemiz sizinle rezonansa giriyorsa, neden Anvil'i kendiniz denemiyorsunuz? |
