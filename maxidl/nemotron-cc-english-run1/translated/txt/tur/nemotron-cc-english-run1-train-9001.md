| UNDERSTANDING SELF-EXECUTING TREATIES VIA STATE PRACTICE<br/><br/>Updated: Feb 2<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>Consider this paradox, when a country ratifies a treaty, it is said to have consented to accept the treaty in its entirety (reservations and declarations being exceptions); but in some cases, the countries go ahead and refuse to adhere to its provisions. For example, Article VI, Clause 2 of the American Constitution has the provisions that "all treaties … shall be the supreme Law of the Land." Although it is evident that treaties on their own do not have the same effect as federal laws. In truth, they only become operational once these provisions come into force as Federal law with Senate and Presidential approval. Although this is the practice, it is a generally accepted principle in international law that certain treaties have a binding effect on countries. The treaty must fulfil the requirement of being a self-executing treaty to affect the country without any corresponding domestic legislature directly.<br/><br/>This raises the question as to which treaty will qualify as "self-executing" and which will not?<br/><br/>Whether a treaty is a self-executing treaty or not is decided by national judges on a case-to-case basis (Buergenthal, 1992). In order to understand this, the paper will first look at the two types of theories followed by countries on the nature of treaties applying to domestic law. These two theories are monism and dualism. They basically view the framework of domestic and international law as a single hierarchy and two separate hierarchies, respectively (Wildhaber, 1971). Countries following monism believe that certain treaties immediately are binding and immediately have an effect on the country. Once the treaty has been ratified, it can be invoked in national courts and is considered to be a part of the law of the country. Countries following dualism believe that a treaty does not affect domestic law until it has been reinforced by a legislature passed in the parliament. An example of dualism is how the European Convention on Human Rights became operational in the United Kingdom after passing the Human Rights Act 1998 in their parliament (Laws, 2000).<br/><br/>International law is diverse, and so are the types of procedures different countries follow for the acceptance of treaties. Some constitutions' themselves mention the procedures for the ratification of a treaty. Some countries even have different treatment given to international treaty law and customary international law. Certain international organizations like the European Union often affect the domestic law of its member states. The member states of the European Union have to give effect to certain forms of community legislature. Although, it has an essential difference from self-executing treaties. The difference is that it is not for national judges to decide whether the provisions are self-executing or not, but rather for the European Court of Justice to interpret under its constitutive treaties. Other forms of international law formed via resolutions or such might not have the same effect for these states. Nevertheless, they might consider them as forms of "soft law" and look into them to interpret the intent of the law. Sometimes, proclamations made by the judicial organs of international organizations such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights affect their member states. Although these proclamations are not binding on the member states, the national judges seem to refer to these for authoritative interpretation.<br/><br/>Therefore, a case-to-case approach must be taken while analyzing the procedures and precedents set in different countries. To examine the concept of self-executing treaties, this paper will compare the precedents set by different jurisdictions. If the reader wishes to conduct a similar analysis, they can do so by looking into the different national yearbooks on international law. Mostly, these yearbooks will have a section devoted to the relationship between international and national law.<br/><br/>International Jurisprudence:<br/><br/>The most significant issue that comes up for national courts is whether the treaty is self-executing? If the treaty can be applied without any additional domestic legislature having passed to reinforce it. This question came up in the case of Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, wherein the Polish Constitutional Court held that since the treaty provisions referred to domestic measures to be taken, the treaty was not self-executing in nature (Bug river claims, Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, 2003). Essentially, when the treaty refers to domestic measures to be taken, it does not in itself create new obligations. It instead reinforces the treaty's intent for the domestic legal process to take measures for the same. A similar issue was raised in the Sosa case in the United States of America. In this case, the court considered whether the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was a self-executing treaty. The American Supreme Court has also declared that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is not a self-executing treaty (Court, 2004). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland also examined the self-executing nature of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The issue before the court was whether Article 13(2)(b) and (c) were self-executing in nature. The court examined whether the treaty was partially self-executing and did so by checking whether there existed a minimum core content for the treaty to be applicable. The court held that it found no such provision within the treaty (A and B v Government of the Canton of Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>It is essential to understand that these issues differ from the fundamental question of whether international law can be applied as part of the law of the land? In order to answer this question, the paper will examine the judgement by the Supreme Court of the Dominican Republic. The Supreme Court stated that Article 3 of the Dominican Republic's Constitution made international law binding on the domestic legal order. The court rejected the Superior Land Court's interpretation that these treaties were "foreign legislature" and not part of the domestic legal order. The Supreme Court laid down that all treaties ratified by the Dominican Republic formed a part of Dominican Law and, therefore, can be termed as self-executing (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland has examined whether the Libson Treaty was self-executing and directly applicable to Swiss Universities. The court held, "According to relevant case law, a treaty norm is directly applicable if its content is sufficiently precise and clear to form the basis of a decision in a particular case. The norm thus has to be justiciable, i.e. define the rights and obligations of an individual and be directed at the competent authorities" (X v University of Lucerne, 2014). This implies that whether the treaty is directly applicable or not, depends upon on whether the norm is justiciable. The Lisbon Treaty is based on the principle of qualifications acquired aboard. This is conveyed through Article IV (1) of the treaty. The purpose of this was to create an obligation for states to show that their decision-making process is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory. The responsibility for proving that the applicant has not met the required criteria is on the "body undertaking the assessment." The treaty guarantees procedural safeguards, which are generally accepted by countries and hence, the court held this treaty to be self-executing. This goes on to showcase the different interpretations undertaken by the courts of various countries.<br/><br/>It is essential to observe whether the norms set out by treaties are actually being complied with. The case laws from various jurisdictions have emphasized that national courts are the final authority on the issue of whether a treaty is self-executing. There is also an inherent duty cast on countries for the observance and due performance of treaties. Such is cast by the Pacta Sunt Servanda rule as enshrined within Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties (VCLT). Article 27 goes on to reinforce it by stating that international law obligations cannot be ignored by using domestic law as a justification. Many countries' courts have used this as a source of interpretation, such as the Latvian Constitutional Court. In the case of a national norm conflicting with an international norm, the court held that the national norm was null and void. To reach its conclusion, the court strongly relied on the necessary performance of treaties in good faith as envisaged in Article 26 of the VCLT (Linija v Latvia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>From the above, it is clear that treaties have particular requirements before they can be considered self-executing. However, keeping all of these aside, the most important still remains the national courts' interpretation. The national courts decide whether the treaty can be called self-executing or not. Although their Constitution's might contain a provision regarding treaty law being the supreme law of the land, courts from different countries interpret these provisions in different manners. This can be seen as to how the American and Dominican Constitutions' both contain these provisions but follow completely different interpretations of the same. The term "self-executing" may not be congruous for these treaties since, in practice, they still need approval from the national courts. Ideally, the way forward should be that countries acknowledge the self-executing nature of treaties and treat them in a fashion wherein Article 26 and 27 of the VCLT are respected. Again, this is the "ideal" situation and is not likely to find its way into state practice of certain jurisdictions anytime soon. Still, hope can be gained via looking into the interpretations of national courts that respect these norms and hopefully pave the way for other courts to acknowledge this.<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Örneğin, VI. Madde, Amerikan Anayasası'nın 2. Maddesi, "tüm antlaşmaların ... Toprağın yüce yasası olacağı" hükümlerine sahiptir. Her ne kadar kendi başlarına yapılan antlaşmaların federal yasalarla aynı etkiye sahip olmadığı açık olsa da. Gerçekte, ancak bu hükümler Senato ve Cumhurbaşkanlığı onayı ile Federal yasa olarak yürürlüğe girdiğinde faaliyete geçerler. Uygulama bu olsa da, bazı antlaşmaların ülkeler üzerinde bağlayıcı bir etkisi olduğu uluslararası hukukta genel olarak kabul görmüş bir ilkedir. Antlaşma, doğrudan ilgili bir iç yasama organı olmadan ülkeyi etkilemek için kendi kendini uygulayan bir antlaşma olma şartını yerine getirmelidir.<br/><br/>Bu, hangi antlaşmanın "kendi kendini yürütme" olarak nitelendirileceği ve hangi antlaşmanın uygulanmayacağı sorusunu gündeme getiriyor.<br/><br/>Bir antlaşmanın kendi kendini uygulayan bir antlaşma olup olmadığı, ulusal yargıçlar tarafından davaya dayalı olarak karara bağlanır (Buergenthal, 1992). Bunu anlamak için, kağıt önce iç hukuka uygulanan antlaşmaların doğası üzerine ülkelerin takip ettiği iki teori türüne bakacaktır. Bu iki teori monizm ve düalizmdir. Temel olarak iç ve uluslararası hukukun çerçevesini sırasıyla tek bir hiyerarşi ve iki ayrı hiyerarşi olarak görürler (Wildhaber, 1971). Monizmi takip eden ülkeler, belirli antlaşmaların derhal bağlayıcı olduğuna ve hemen ülke üzerinde bir etkiye sahip olduğuna inanmaktadır. Antlaşma onaylandıktan sonra, ulusal mahkemelerde çağrılabilir ve ülke hukukunun bir parçası olarak kabul edilir. Dualizmi takip eden ülkeler, bir antlaşmanın parlamentoda kabul edilen bir yasama organı tarafından takviye edilmedikçe iç hukuku etkilemediğine inanmaktadır. Dualizmin bir örneği, Avrupa İnsan Hakları Sözleşmesi'nin 1998 İnsan Hakları Yasası'nı parlamentolarında geçtikten sonra Birleşik Krallık'ta nasıl faaliyete geçtiğidir (Kanunlar, 2000).<br/><br/>Uluslararası hukuk çeşitlidir ve anlaşmaların kabulü için farklı ülkelerin izlediği prosedür türleri de vardır. Bazı anayasaların kendileri bir antlaşmanın onaylanması için prosedürlerden bahsederler. Hatta bazı ülkeler uluslararası antlaşma hukukuna ve geleneksel uluslararası hukuka göre farklı muamelelere maruz kalmaktadır. Avrupa Birliği gibi bazı uluslararası kuruluşlar üye ülkelerinin iç hukukunu sık sık etkilemektedir. Avrupa Birliği üyesi ülkeler, belirli toplum yasama organlarına etki etmek zorundadır. Bununla birlikte, kendi kendini icra eden anlaşmalardan önemli bir farkı vardır. Aradaki fark, hükümlerin kendi kendine uygulanıp uygulanmadığına ulusal yargıçların karar vermesi değil, daha ziyade Avrupa Adalet Divanı'nın kurucu antlaşmaları uyarınca yorumlanmasıdır. Kararlar veya benzeri yollarla oluşturulan diğer uluslararası hukuk biçimleri bu devletler için aynı etkiye sahip olmayabilir. Bununla birlikte, bunları "yumuşak hukuk" biçimleri olarak değerlendirebilir ve hukukun niyetini yorumlamak için bunlara bakabilirler. Bazen, Amerikanlerarası İnsan Hakları Mahkemesi gibi uluslararası kuruluşların yargı organları tarafından yapılan bildiriler üye devletlerini etkiler. Bu bildiriler üye ülkeler üzerinde bağlayıcı olmamakla birlikte, ulusal yargıçlar yetkili yorum için bunlara atıfta bulunuyor gibi görünmektedir.<br/><br/>Bu nedenle, farklı ülkelerde belirlenen usul ve emsalleri incelerken bir davaya yaklaşım gösterilmelidir. Kendi kendine yürütme antlaşmaları kavramını incelemek için, bu makale farklı yargı bölgeleri tarafından belirlenen emsalleri karşılaştıracaktır. Okuyucu benzer bir analiz yapmak isterse, bunu uluslararası hukukla ilgili farklı ulusal yıllıklara bakarak yapabilirler. Çoğunlukla, bu yıllıklar, uluslararası ve ulusal hukuk arasındaki ilişkiye ayrılmış bir bölüme sahip olacaktır.<br/><br/>Uluslararası Hukuk:<br/><br/>Ulusal mahkemeler için ortaya çıkan en önemli konu, antlaşmanın kendi kendine uygulanıp uygulanmadığıdır. Antlaşma, takviye etmek için herhangi bir ek yerli yasama organı geçmeden uygulanabilirse. Bu soru, Polonya Anayasa Mahkemesi'nin, alınacak iç önlemlere atıfta bulunulan antlaşma hükümlerinin doğada kendi kendine uygulanmadığını savunduğu Czesaw S v Devlet Hazinesi ve Devlet Hazinesi Bakanı davasında ortaya çıktı (Bug ırmağı iddiaları, Czeswaw S v Devlet Hazinesi Bakanı, 2003). Esasen, antlaşma alınacak iç önlemlere atıfta bulunduğunda, kendi başına yeni yükümlülükler yaratmaz. Bunun yerine, antlaşmanın iç hukuk sürecinin aynı şekilde önlemler alması yönündeki niyetini pekiştirir. Benzer bir konu Amerika Birleşik Devletleri'ndeki Sosa davasında da gündeme geldi. Bu durumda mahkeme, Uluslararası Medeni ve Siyasi Haklar Sözleşmesi'nin kendi kendini yürüten bir antlaşma olup olmadığını değerlendirdi. Amerikan Yüksek Mahkemesi ayrıca, Uluslararası Medeni ve Siyasi Haklar Sözleşmesi'nin kendi kendini yürüten bir antlaşma olmadığını da ilan etmiştir (Court, 2004). İsviçre Federal Yüksek Mahkemesi ayrıca, Uluslararası Medeni ve Siyasi Haklar Sözleşmesi'nin kendi kendini icra eden doğasını da inceledi. Mahkeme önündeki mesele, Madde 13(2)(b) ve (c)'nin doğada kendi kendini icra edip etmediğiydi. Mahkeme, antlaşmanın kısmen kendi kendine uygulanıp uygulanmadığını inceledi ve antlaşmanın uygulanabilir olması için asgari bir çekirdek içerik olup olmadığını kontrol ederek bunu yaptı. Mahkeme, antlaşmada böyle bir hüküm bulunmadığını kabul etti (Zürich Kantonu Hükümeti, 2000).<br/><br/>Bu konuların, uluslararası hukukun toprak hukukunun bir parçası olarak uygulanıp uygulanamayacağı konusundaki temel sorundan farklı olduğunu anlamak esastır. Bu soruyu yanıtlamak için, gazete Dominik Cumhuriyeti Yüksek Mahkemesi'nin kararını inceleyecektir. Yüksek Mahkeme, Dominik Cumhuriyeti Anayasası'nın 3. maddesinin iç hukuk düzeninde uluslararası hukuku bağlayıcı hale getirdiğini belirtmiştir. Mahkeme, Yüksek Toprak Mahkemesi'nin bu antlaşmaların "yabancı yasama organı" olduğu ve iç hukuk düzeninin bir parçası olmadığı yorumunu reddetti. Yüksek Mahkeme, Dominik Cumhuriyeti tarafından onaylanan tüm antlaşmaların Dominik Yasası'nın bir parçasını oluşturduğunu ve bu nedenle kendi kendini yürütme olarak adlandırılabileceğini belirtmiştir (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepcien and ors, 1997). İsviçre Federal Yüksek Mahkemesi, Libson Antlaşması'nın kendi kendine uygulanıp uygulanmadığını ve İsviçre Üniversiteleri için doğrudan geçerli olup olmadığını inceledi. Mahkeme, "İlgili dava hukukuna göre, içeriğinin belirli bir davada bir kararın temelini oluşturacak kadar kesin ve açık olması durumunda, bir antlaşma normu doğrudan uygulanabilir. Bu nedenle normun haklı olması, yani bir bireyin hak ve yükümlülüklerini tanımlaması ve yetkili makamlara yönlendirilmesi gerekir" (X v Lucerne Üniversitesi, 2014). Bu, antlaşmanın doğrudan uygulanabilir olup olmadığına, normun haklı olup olmadığına bağlı olduğunu ima eder. Lizbon Antlaşması, gemide edinilen nitelikler ilkesine dayanmaktadır. Bu, antlaşmanın IV. Maddesi (1) ile iletilir. Bunun amacı, devletlerin karar alma süreçlerinin adil, şeffaf ve ayrımcı olmayan olduğunu göstermeleri için bir zorunluluk yaratmaktı. Başvuru sahibinin gerekli kriterleri karşılamadığını kanıtlama sorumluluğu "değerlendirmeyi yapan kişi" üzerinedir. Antlaşma, genellikle ülkeler tarafından kabul edilen ve bu nedenle mahkemenin bu antlaşmayı kendi kendine yürütmesi için yaptığı prosedürel güvenceleri garanti eder. Bu, çeşitli ülkelerin mahkemeleri tarafından üstlenilen farklı yorumları sergilemeye devam eder.<br/><br/>Antlaşmalar tarafından belirlenen normların gerçekten uyulup uyulmadığını gözlemlemek esastır. Çeşitli yargı bölgelerinden gelen dava yasaları, bir antlaşmanın kendi kendine uygulanıp uygulanmadığı konusunda ulusal mahkemelerin nihai otorite olduğunu vurgulamıştır. Antlaşmaların yerine getirilmesi ve yerine getirilmesi için ülkeler üzerinde doğal bir görev de vardır. Bu durum, Viyana Antlaşmalar Hukuku Sözleşmesi'nin (VCLT) 26. maddesinde yer alan Pacta Sunt Servanda kuralı tarafından belirlenir. Madde 27, iç hukukun gerekçe olarak kullanılmasıyla uluslararası hukuk yükümlülüklerinin göz ardı edilemeyeceğini belirterek bunu pekiştirmeye devam ediyor. Birçok ülkenin mahkemeleri bunu Letonya Anayasa Mahkemesi gibi bir yorum kaynağı olarak kullanmıştır. Mahkeme, uluslararası bir normla çelişen bir ulusal norm durumunda, ulusal normun hükümsüz ve hükümsüz olduğuna karar verdi. Mahkeme, sonuca ulaşmak için, VCLT'nin 26. maddesinde öngörüldüğü gibi, antlaşmaların iyi niyetle gerekli performansına güçlü bir şekilde güvendi (Linija v Letonya, 2004).<br/><br/>Sonuç:<br/><br/>Yukarıdan itibaren, antlaşmaların kendi kendini yürütme olarak kabul edilmeden önce belirli gereksinimleri olduğu açıktır. Ancak, bunların hepsini bir kenara tutmak, en önemlisi hala ulusal mahkemelerin yorumudur. Ulusal mahkemeler, antlaşmanın kendi kendini yürütme olarak adlandırılıp adlandırılamayacağına karar verir. Anayasaları, antlaşma hukukunun toprakların en üst yasası olmasına ilişkin bir hüküm içerebilmesine rağmen, farklı ülkelerden mahkemeler bu hükümleri farklı şekillerde yorumlamaktadır. Bu, Amerikan ve Dominik Anayasalarının her ikisinin de bu hükümleri nasıl içerdiği, ancak aynı şeyin tamamen farklı yorumlarını takip ettiği konusunda görülebilir. "Kendi kendini yürütme" terimi, uygulamada hala ulusal mahkemelerin onayına ihtiyaç duyduklarından, bu antlaşmalar için uygun olmayabilir. İdeal olarak, ilerlemenin yolu, ülkelerin antlaşmaların kendi kendini gerçekleştiren doğasını kabul etmeleri ve VCLT'nin 26 ve 27. maddelerine saygı duyulan bir şekilde davranmaları olmalıdır. Yine, bu "ideal" durumdur ve yakın bir zamanda belirli yargı bölgelerinin devlet uygulamasına girmenin yolunu bulması muhtemel değildir. Yine de, bu normlara saygı duyan ve umarım diğer mahkemelerin bunu kabul etmesini sağlayan ulusal mahkemelerin yorumlarına bakarak umut kazanılabilir.<br/><br/>Kaynakça:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

| Behind-the-Scenes Tragedies That Affected the Cast of TV's Deadliest Catch<br/><br/>Lowered Fishing Quotas<br/><br/>Even though the crew on Deadliest Catch make the majority of their money from Discovery, that doesn't mean they don't actually sell their haul. So, you could say they have two sources of income, which is something that most people in their line of work don't have.<br/><br/>However, back in 2017, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game started a quota system, which limited the amount of fish any fishing boat could bring back to shore by half. That meant the crew on Deadliest Catch experienced a huge drop in profits for several years. Hey, at least they have Discovery to pay the bills, right? | Televizyonun En Ölümcül Yakalanmasının Kadrosunu Etkileyen Sahne Arkası Trajedileri<br/><br/>Balık Tutma Kontenjanları<br/><br/>Deadliest Catch'teki mürettebat, paralarının çoğunu Discovery'den kazansa da, bu aslında mallarını satmadıkları anlamına gelmez. Yani, iki gelir kaynakları olduğunu söyleyebilirsiniz, ki bu da kendi çalışma alanlarındaki çoğu insanın sahip olmadığı bir şeydir.<br/><br/>Bununla birlikte, 2017'de Alaska Balık ve Oyun Departmanı, herhangi bir balıkçı teknesinin kıyıya geri getirebileceği balık miktarını yarıya indiren bir kota sistemi başlattı. Bu, Deadliest Catch'teki mürettebatın birkaç yıl boyunca büyük bir kâr düşüşü yaşadığı anlamına geliyordu. |

| BLOGS<br/><br/>Check out our collection of blogs written by fellow staff members.<br/><br/>INFORMATIONAL BLOGS<br/><br/>Don't Stress It<br/><br/>by<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>&#124; Nov 12, 2020<br/><br/>Stress, no matter how great things are going, it can always find a way to rear its ugly head. Whether it is a last-minute job request or a paper that you forgot to write and it is due the next day, stress can always find a way into your day if you allow it. Today I will show you a few things you can do to eliminate or prevent stress.<br/><br/>The first thing you can do is to exercise. Exercising is a great way to relieve stress because it lowers the stress hormone in your body known as cortisol. The lower levels of cortisol in your body, the lower your stress level will be. Exercise can also increase your confidence, and when your confidence is up then your stress is usually down. For me, when I get stressed, I always exercise by going to the gym and practice boxing, it helps me burn calories and reduce stress while having fun.<br/><br/>Writing things down has been a way to calm people down for a very long time, and it is the next topic on our list. Writing down what is making you stressed is a way to clear the mind, and it helps get rid of stress as well. I have a similar experience when writing stories, usually if I cannot think of a new idea because of an old one, I will write the old idea down and think on it. That is when new ideas start to spring up and I can continue writing normally. It is the same with stress. Think about a stream it continues to flow down it's path until it hits a beaver dam, and that dam blocks the flow of water and everything starts to build up. The only way to get the water flow back to normal is to remove the dam. This is where writing comes in. When you write it down, you are removing stress piece by piece until you can think normally again.<br/><br/>Stress can come into our lives through doors in our life that we keep open. Procrastination is a way that we can leave the doors open for stress. Waiting until tomorrow may be fun for today, but it will hurt you tomorrow, and is a very short-sighted solution. The longer you wait to do something, the larger that something becomes, and the larger it becomes the more stress you will be inviting into your life. Taking care of something as soon as we receive it is a great way to prevent stress, but it is something that takes great discipline to do. The more you cut Procrastination out of your life, the more stress free you will be. So shut that door, you're letting all the cold air out.<br/><br/>So let's review: Exercise, Write down what is stressing you, and Do not Procrastinate. These are only a few ways to relieve stress but to me, they are the most effective. While I know these may not work for everyone I would like to invite anyone feeling stressed to research how to get rid of it. | BLOGLAR<br/><br/>Diğer personel üyeleri tarafından yazılan blog koleksiyonumuza göz atın.<br/><br/>BİLGİSEL BLOGLAR<br/><br/>Strese girme<br/><br/>tarafından<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>12 Kasım 2020<br/><br/>Stres, ne kadar harika şeyler olursa olsun, her zaman çirkin kafasını geri çekmenin bir yolunu bulabilir. İster son dakika iş talebi ister yazmayı unuttuğunuz bir kağıt olsun ve ertesi gün, stres izin verirseniz gününüze her zaman bir yol bulabilir. Bugün size stresi ortadan kaldırmak veya önlemek için yapabileceğiniz birkaç şey göstereceğim.<br/><br/>Yapabileceğiniz ilk şey egzersiz yapmaktır. Egzersiz yapmak, vücudunuzdaki kortizol olarak bilinen stres hormonunu düşürdüğü için stresi hafifletmek için harika bir yoldur. Vücudunuzdaki kortizol seviyesi ne kadar düşük olursa, stres seviyeniz de o kadar düşük olacaktır. Egzersiz ayrıca güveninizi artırabilir ve güveniniz yükseldiğinde stresiniz genellikle azalır. Benim için, stresli olduğumda, her zaman spor salonuna giderek ve boks yaparak egzersiz yaparım, bu da kalori yakmama ve eğlenirken stresi azaltmama yardımcı olur.<br/><br/>Bir şeyleri yazmak, insanları çok uzun zamandır sakinleştirmenin bir yolu olmuştur ve listemizdeki bir sonraki konudur. Sizi strese sokan şeyi yazmak, zihni temizlemenin bir yoludur ve stresten de kurtulmaya yardımcı olur. Hikayeler yazarken de benzer bir deneyimim var, genellikle eski bir fikir yüzünden yeni bir fikir düşünemiyorsam, eski fikri yazıp düşüneceğim. İşte o zaman yeni fikirler ortaya çıkmaya başlar ve normal bir şekilde yazmaya devam edebilirim. Stresle aynıdır. Bir kunduz barajına çarpana kadar yoluna devam eden bir akarsu düşünün ve bu baraj su akışını engeller ve her şey birikmeye başlar. Su akışını normale döndürmenin tek yolu barajı kaldırmaktır. Yazmanın geldiği yer burasıdır. Yazdığınızda, tekrar normal düşünebilene kadar stresi parça parça ortadan kaldırıyorsunuz.<br/><br/>Stres yaşamımızda açık tuttuğumuz kapılar aracılığıyla hayatımıza girebilir. Erteleme, kapıları strese açık bırakmanın bir yoludur. Yarına kadar beklemek bugün için eğlenceli olabilir, ancak yarın size zarar verir ve çok kısa görüşlü bir çözümdür. Bir şey yapmak için ne kadar uzun beklerseniz, bir şey o kadar büyür ve hayatınıza davet edeceğiniz stres o kadar büyür. Bir şeyi alır almaz onunla ilgilenmek stresi önlemenin harika bir yoludur, ancak bunu yapmak için büyük bir disiplin gerekir. Ertelemeyi hayatınızdan ne kadar çok keserseniz, o kadar stressiz olursunuz. O yüzden kapıyı kapat, tüm soğuk havayı dışarı çıkarıyorsun.<br/><br/>Bu yüzden gözden geçirelim: Egzersiz, sizi strese sokan şeyleri yazın ve ertelemeyin. Bunlar stresi azaltmanın sadece birkaç yolu ama benim için en etkili olanlardır. Bunların herkes için işe yaramayacağını bildiğim halde, stres altında olan herkesi ondan nasıl kurtulacağını araştırmaya davet etmek istiyorum. |
