| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Leclaire<br/><br/>Bir zamanlar Edwardsville'in "güneydeki banliyösü" olarak anılan tarihi Leclaire mahallesi, 1890'da kooperatif bir topluluk olarak kuruldu ve 1934'te Edwardsville şehrine ilhak edilene kadar ayrı bir köy olarak kaldı. Amerika Birleşik Devletleri ve Avrupa'daki gazeteler ve dergiler, Leclaire deneyini, özellikle de varlığının ilk 20 yılında bildirdi. 1979'da, eşsiz tarihi nedeniyle, eski köy Ulusal Tarihi Yerler Sicili'nde listelenmiştir.<br/><br/>Leclaire, uzun yıllar boyunca işçi sınıfının kötü durumunu ilerletmeye çalışan St. Louis sıhhi tesisat üreticisi Nelson Oliver Nelson tarafından kuruldu. Nelson, çalışanları için çalışma koşullarını iyileştirmek ve fabrikaların yakınında konut sağlamak istedi, böylece işçiler ve aileleri şirket tarafından ücretsiz olarak sunulan eğlence ve eğitim programlarına kolayca katılabilecekti. 1890'dan önce, hala St. Louis'de iken, N. O. Nelson Şirketi'nin üretim ve dağıtım işletmeleri, eğitim ve eğlence olanaklarıyla birlikte kar paylaşımı sağlamaya başladı. Leclaire işbirliği deneyi ek faydalar getirecektir.<br/><br/>Nelson çalışanları kırsal bir yere taşınmak istediklerini belirttiğinde, şirket temsilcileri St. Louis merkezlerinin yakınındaki birkaç Missouri ve Illinois topluluğundaki küçük kasabaların liderlerine yaklaştılar. Yeni fabrikalar ve örnek bir köy inşa etmek için uygun bir mülk arıyorlardı. Edwardsville'in güneyinde su, kömür ve ulaşıma erişimi olan 125 dönümlük bir arazi buldular. Yerel işadamları finansal teşvik sunmak için hızlı hareket ettiler. Üç haftadan kısa bir süre içinde topluluk, Nelson'ı girişimi için Edwardsville'i seçmesi için ikna etmek için 1 ila 1000 dolar arasındaki bireysel katkılardan 20.000 dolarlık bir fon topladı.<br/><br/>Şehir liderleri Edwardsville'in şehir sınırları içinde mülk bulmayı umuyorlardı, ancak uygun bir yer bulunamadığında, şehrin güneyindeki Nelson yatırımının yakında Edwardsville'in bir parçası olacağından emindiler. Nelson, sözleşmesinde inşaat ve iş yaratmanın tüm olasılıklarını yerine getirmiş olsa da, Edwardsville'e ilhak edilmeden 44 yıl önce olacaktı. Doğuda Madison/Brown Avenues, batıda demiryolu rayları, güneyde Hadley/McKinley Avenues ve kuzeyde Wolf Street tarafından sınırlanan Leclaire, 1890-1934 yılları arasında bağımsız bir köy olarak kaldı. Bu süre zarfında iş, eğitim ve konut planlamasındaki yeniliklerle ün kazandı.<br/><br/>1931 Edwardsville haritasında Leclaire köyü<br/>Paul Jenkins'in izniyle<br/><br/>Nelson'ın bir köy inşa etme kararı bir hevesle verilmedi. 1880'lerin sonuna kadar iş birliği ve kar paylaşımı alanlarında uluslararası bir liderdi, St. Louis işini genişletirken dünyadaki diğerleriyle sosyal teoriler alışverişinde bulundu. Deneysel köyüne Parisli kar paylaşımcısı Edme Jean Leclaire'in adını verdi, ancak bilgi ve ilham sağlayan diğer birçok sosyal vizyonerleri ziyaret etti. Bu örneklerden en iyi fikirleri derleyen Nelson, Leclaire'i kendi sözleriyle "iş vermek, zekayı teşvik etmek, rekreasyon sağlamak, güzelliği teşvik etmek ve ev yapmak" için kurdu. Bunlar, erkeklerin tatmin edici yaşamlar sürdürmeleri için gerekli olduğunu belirlediği faktörlerdi. Daha sonraki yazarlar Leclaire'in kurucu ilkelerini formüle etmek için bu kelimeleri kullandılar: İş, Evler, Eğitim, Rekreasyon ve Güzellik, ancak ek önemli Özgürlük ilkesi ile.<br/><br/>Çalışma<br/><br/>Leclaire'deki fabrika işleri olmasaydı köy olmayacağı için iş bu faktörlerin en önemlisi olarak kabul edilebilirdi. Tuğla fabrikası binaları, mimar E. A. Cameron tarafından yaz aylarında doğal ışık, havalandırma ve kışın ısıtmalı zeminler sağlamak için tasarlanmıştır. Yangın söndürme sistemi vardı ve endüstriyel kazalar ortadan kaldırılmamasına rağmen, işçilerin güvenliğini sağlamak için her türlü çaba gösterildi. Sarmaşık kaplı tuğla binalar, komplekse kampüs benzeri bir görünüm kazandıran iyi yönetilen çimler ve çiçek bahçeleri ile çevriliydi. 1894'te New York World muhabiri Nellie Bly, binaları "insanın çalışması için binaların ideal mükemmelliği" olarak nitelendirdi.<br/><br/>Leclaire'deki N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company'nin üretim kompleksi<br/>Leclaire'in Arkadaşları<br/><br/>Nelson şirket politikaları, çalışanların finansal istikrarını korumak için tasarlandı. İşçiler, bu seçeneği seçerlerse kârdan pay kazanabilir ve şirkette bir sese sahip olabilirler. Kâr paylaşımı planı Nelson çalışanlarına destekleyici bir işgücü ile sonuçlanan bir sahip olma gururu verdi. Yıllar boyunca birkaç kısa ömürlü işçi grevi oldu, ancak çoğunlukla işgücü sorunları nadirdi. İşçilerin de makul saatleri ve rekabetçi ücretleri vardı. Emekli maaşları ve hastalık izninin yanı sıra, bir işçinin ölmesi durumunda dul emekli maaşları, ölüm onun istihdamı ile ilgili olsun ya da olmasın, sağlanan bir fon vardı.<br/><br/>N. O. Nelson Company'nin (NONCO) şirket merkezi St. Louis'de kaldı, ancak N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company'nin tamamı Leclaire'e taşındı. İmalat şirketi, çeşitli ürünler yapan mağazalara ayrıldı. 1900 yılında, dükkanlar vergi amaçlı bağımsız şirketler haline geldi, ancak hepsi hala N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company'ye aitti. Mağazalar, dolaptan değirmen fabrikasına kadar ahşap ürünlerin üretildiği Kabine Değirmeni'ni içeriyordu. Burada çalışan yetenekli zanaatkarlar, yerel bir banka için vezne kafesleri ve Edwardsville'deki St. Andrew's Episcopal Kilisesi'nde hala kullanılan bir sunak da dahil olmak üzere özel sözleşmeleri yerine getirdi. Marble Shop, Nelson ekipleri tarafından Midwest boyunca evlerde, işletmelerde ve hatta devlet kapitollerinde kesilip monte edilen mimari mermer konusunda uzmanlaşmıştır. Bignall ve Keeler haline gelen Machine Shop, boru montaj makineleri, pompalar, ölçü aletleri ve sıhhi tesisat ticaretinde beklenen çeşitli mekanik aletler yaptı. Ayrıca 1890'ların ortalarında Leclaire Bisikleti gibi özel ürünler üretmek için dallandılar. Pirinç Dükkanı, çeşitli sıhhi tesisat borularının ve aletlerinin üretildiği bir dökümhane içeriyordu. Bu örnekler, Leclaire fabrikalarında yapılan işlerin sadece bir kısmını temsil ediyor. Şirketin logosu, bugün Edwardsville'deki tesisat armatürlerinde ve bazı yangın musluğunda hala görülebilen stilize bir "NONCO" idi.<br/><br/>Evler<br/><br/>Evler inşa edilmeden önce, fabrika binalarını tamamlayan işçilerin yanı sıra evler inşa eden işçiler için konut gerekiyordu. Bu ihtiyaçları karşılamak için şirket, birçok amaca hizmet eden büyük bir bina olan "Kulüp Evi"ni inşa etti. Konaklamanın yanı sıra, topluluğun ilk eğitim binasıydı ve iyi stoklanmış bir kütüphane içeriyordu.<br/><br/>Leclaire'in konut kısmının inşaatı, 1890 yılının Haziran ayında köy kurulduktan hemen sonra başladı. Leclaire'de ilk kuraları hazırlayan yenilikçi peyzaj mimarı Julius Pitzman, onları bir dizi koruyucu antlaşma ile donattı. Geniş, eğrisel sokaklar, büyük kuralar ve mülkleri yalnızca konut veya eğitim amaçlı sınırlayan bir tapu kısıtlaması için sağlanan antlaşmalar. Şirket sokakları döşedi, elektrikli sokak lambaları sağladı, kaldırımlar kurdu ve Leclaire sokakları boyunca yüzlerce ağaç dikti. Leclaire'in daha sonraki bölümleri geleneksel bir ızgara tasarımı ve daha küçük lotlarla döşendi, ancak yine de tapu kısıtlamalarını içeriyordu.<br/><br/>1907 yılında bir Leclaire Victorian kır evi<br/>Adı Soyadı : Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Başlangıçta evler şirket tarafından inşa edildi ve daha sonra ev sahipliğini teşvik etmek için Nelson çalışanlarına yakın bir maliyetle satıldı. Bir işçi hastalandıysa ve ipotekini yapamadıysa, ödemeler işe geri dönene kadar askıya alındı. Evler çeşitli ev tasarımlarında sunuldu ve şirket iki konutun birbirine benzemediğini ilan etti. İlk evler öncelikle elektrik ve akan su ile gelen Viktorya yazlıklarıydı. Bunları bungalovlar, dörtkareler ve hatta bazı kit evleri izledi. Mimari tasarım şirket standartlarını karşılaması koşuluyla, sakinler şirket yapımı bir ev satın alabilir veya boş bir arsa satın alabilir ve kendileri bir ev inşa edebilirdi.<br/><br/>Daha sonraki yıllarda yatırımcılara, genellikle Edwardsville sakinlerine çok şey satıldı ve 1920'lerde birçok ev, daha sonra bölge sakinlerine satan yerel müteahhitler tarafından inşa edildi.<br/><br/>Eğitim<br/><br/>Nelson, işçi sınıfı da dahil olmak üzere herkes için eğitime inanıyordu. Eğitim programlaması 1892'de Club House'da bir anaokulu ile başladı ve 722 Holyoake Yolu'ndaki yeni eğitim binasında devam etti. Yaygın olarak "Okul Evi" olarak adlandırılan bu bina, toplantılar ve programlar için büyük bir salon sağladı, ancak gün boyunca sınıf alanına bölmek için hareketli bölümlere sahipti. Akşamları, Washington Üniversitesi profesörleri veya N. O. Nelson gibi ulusal olarak tanınan konuşmacıların yüzyılın başında sosyal iyileştirme hareketinin bir parçası olan haftalık konferansları içeren Leclaire Self-Culture Club'ın dansları, toplantıları veya programları vardı. Bunlar arasında Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Altın Kural" Jones ve yazar Charlotte Perkins Gilman da vardı.<br/><br/>1913'te Leclaire anaokuluna kaydolan çocuklar<br/>Adı Soyadı : Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Eğitim binasının 1895'teki inşaatını takip eden on yıl içinde, bir sanayi okulu, kolej, gece okulu ve bir akademi de dahil olmak üzere bir dizi eğitim deneyi yapıldı. En eski ve en uzun ömürlü çaba, 1892'de Fröbel Modeli'ni kullanan sabah anaokuluydu. Bu iki yıllık program, Edwardsville çocukları da dahil olmak üzere, 1931 yılına kadar, şirketin çalışanların çocuğu olmayan öğrencilere öğrenim ücreti ödemeye başladığı zamana kadar herkese ücretsizdi. Nelson Manufacturing, binanın nominal bir ücret karşılığında Edwardsville Okul Bölgesi'ne devredildiği 1934 yılına kadar bir anaokulu işletti.<br/><br/>Rekreasyon<br/><br/>1915'te Leclaire Gölü'nde kayıkçılar<br/>Adı Soyadı : Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Rekreasyon Leclaire'in önemli bir özelliğiydi. Şirket beyzbol, tenis ve daha sonra futbol için spor tesisleri sağladı. Bir bowling ve bilardo salonu inşa edildi ve kışın teknecilik, yüzme, balıkçılık veya buz pateni için bir göl vardı. Leclaire Park, kayıkhaneler, erkek ve kadın banyo evleri ve büyük bir pavyon ile döşenmiştir. Sakinleri danslar, samanlıklar, heceleme arıları ve diğer etkinlikler düzenlediler ve şirket, köydeki veya Edwardsville'deki eğlencelerde düzenli olarak çalan bir gruba sponsor oldu. Club House ve School House'daki eğitim fonksiyonları gibi, Leclaire'deki eğlence tesisleri de herkese açıktı ve genellikle Edwardsville ve hatta St. Louis ziyaretçileri için bir varış noktasıydı.<br/><br/>Güzellik<br/><br/>Leclaire Gölü'nün erken fotoğrafı<br/>Adı Soyadı : Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson'ın çevreyle ilgili tatmin edici bir yaşam için önemli gördüğü faktörlerin sonuncusu. Nelson sağlıklı yaşamın önemini biliyordu. Ülkede bulunabilecek güzellik ve temizliğe değer verdi ve Leclaire'deki herkesi bahçe ve meyve bahçeleri dikerek mülklerini güzelleştirmeye teşvik etti. Nelson'ın kendisi de örnek olarak öncülük etti, bu yüzden bir şirket serası ücretsiz çiçekler sağladı ve en güzel yardlar için yarışmalar düzenlendi. Leclaire, tüm köyün bugün hala belirgin olan park benzeri bir ortama sahip olması için döşendi.<br/><br/>Özgürlük<br/><br/>Leclaire Kooperatifi mağazası<br/>Adı Soyadı : Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson, Leclaire için beş kurucu ilke listeledi, ancak modern yazarlar altıncı bir ilke ekledi: Özgürlük. Şirket tarafından sunulan tüm programlar, yerel sakinlerin yanı sıra çalışanlara da açıktı, ancak hiçbiri zorunlu değildi. Şirket programlarına katılıp katılmamayı seçme özgürlüğü tamamen kişiye bağlıydı. Leclaire sakinleri Nelson Manufacturing veya başka bir yerde çalışabilirdi ve işçiler Leclaire'de yaşamak zorunda değildi. Eğlence ve eğitim programlarına katılım da isteğe bağlıydı. Çalışanların alışveriş yapabileceği bir şirket mağazası da vardı, ancak diğer şirket kasabalarının aksine, hiç kimse şirket mağazasına borçlu değildi. Leclaire Mağazası, üyelerin adil piyasa fiyatlarından ücretlendirildiği, ancak daha sonra üç aylık temettü ödendiği bir kooperatifti.<br/><br/>Farklı Bir Şirket Kasabası<br/><br/>Tüm bu faydalar Leclaire'i diğer şirket kasabalarından benzersiz hale getirdi. Ancak şirketin çalışanlara şefkat ve bakım gösterdiği bireysel durumlar da vardı. Şirket fabrikaları kapattı ve 1904 St. Louis Dünya Fuarı'nda işçileri ve ailelerini bir günlüğüne St. Louis'e götürmek için gezi trenleri kiraladı. Para sıkı olduğunda, Nelson bazen işçiler için hayatı kolaylaştırmak için her ödeme zarfına fazladan para koyardı ve eğer erkeklerin kabul etmediği bir program başlatırsa, bunu konuştular ve çoğu zaman Nelson kendini tersine çevirirdi.<br/><br/>Lillesand, Norveç'te 1841'de doğan N. O. Nelson karmaşık bir adamdı. Serbest girişime inanan bir kapitalistti, aynı zamanda bir sosyalistti, "Altın Kural"ın takipçisiydi ve İç Savaş'ta Birlik için görev yapan bir vatanseverdi. 1900'e gelindiğinde, multimilyonerdi, ancak 1922'de öldüğü zaman, işçi sınıfının iyileştirilmesi için her şeyi vermişti.<br/><br/>Leclaire, Nelson'ın tek sosyal deneyi olmamasına rağmen, en başarılı çalışması olarak kabul edilir. Sosyal iyileşme için diğer önemli çabalar arasında New Orleans'taki bir kooperatif bakkal zinciri, Bessemer, Alabama, fabrikalarındaki siyahi çalışanların çocukları için bir anaokulu ve Indio, Kaliforniya'daki tüketiciler için bir ev vardı.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire, uluslararası alanda kayda değer ve başarılı bir deney olarak ünlendi. New York World'de birçok kez anlatıldı, ancak özellikle muhabir Nellie Bly tarafından 1894'te "Emek sorununun çözüldüğü ve herkesin St. Louis yakınlarındaki küçük bir köyde mutlu olduğu" model kasaba hakkında uzun uzun yazdı. Los Angeles Times ayrıca Chicago Daily Tribune ve diğer birçok yayında olduğu gibi N. O. Nelson hakkında düzenli olarak rapor verdi.<br/><br/>1915'te Leclaire'in 15. yıldönümü kutlamasında yaptığı bir konuşmada Nelson, "Leclaire size geniş bir açık misafirperverlik sunuyor ve bugün her gün zevk aldığımız rahatlık, konfor ve güzellik ve ilhamın tadını çıkarmanızı teklif ediyor" dedi. O günden bu yana bir asırdan fazla zaman geçti, ancak davet hala duruyor. Sakinleri ve araştırmacılar Leclaire'in tarihini öğrenmeye ve gelecek nesillerin iyileştirilmesi için öğrenilebilecek dersleri düşünmeye davet ediliyor.<br/><br/>2019 yılında üretim kompleksinin eski binalarından biri, şimdi Lewis ve Clark Community College N. O. Nelson Kampüsü olarak hizmet veriyor.<br/>Fotoğraf: Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Leclaire'in Yüzüncü Yıl kutlamasının ardından 1990 yılında düzenlenen Leclaire Dostları, Leclaire'in tarihini bir web sitesi (tarihi-leclaire.org), yayınlar ve her yıl Ekim ayının üçüncü Pazar günü düzenlenen bir festival olan Leclaire Parkfest aracılığıyla tanıtıyor. |

But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Yazar Zoom veya Skype üzerinden ziyaret eder<br/><br/>Zoom veya Skype üzerinden öğrencilerinizi ziyaret etmekten heyecan duyuyorum! Skype, kişisel yazarları getirmeyen, ancak kitapları ve şiirleri keşfetmek, bir yazarla bağlantı kurmak ve bire bir sorular sormak isteyen okullar / sınıflar için harika bir seçenektir.<br/><br/>Maliyet<br/><br/>Oturum başına 125 $ (veya sabah veya öğleden sonra üç saat içinde gerçekleşen iki oturum için 200 $; bir günde üç oturum için 325 $; bir günde dört oturum için 425 $) için okullarla 30-45 dakikalık Zoom veya Skype ziyaretleri sunuyorum. Her seansta, çocukları mümkün olduğunca aktif bir şekilde dahil etmeye çalışıyorum. Hayır, kişisel bir ziyaretin sunduğu bağlantının aynısı değil, ancak yine de çocuklar için ilham verici ve motive edici olabilir!<br/><br/>Ne Yaparım<br/><br/>50 öğrenciye kadar her oturum şunları içerir:<br/><br/>5 Dakikalık Teknoloji Kurulumu<br/><br/>Her biri 10ish-dakikadan oluşan 3 segment – Aralarından seçim yaparsınız:<br/><br/>Nasıl Yazar Oldum<br/><br/>Bu özel kitabı yazmak (hangi kitaba odaklandığımı seçersiniz)<br/><br/>Okumak (Bazı şiirler ve çocuklar başkalarını okumama yardım eder)<br/><br/>Sınıf sunumu (öğrencileriniz benim için bir okuma veya performans sergilediler - çok takdire şayan bir izleyici!)<br/><br/>Birlikte şiir yazmak<br/><br/>Soru ve Yanıt Oturumu<br/><br/>5 dakikalık paketler/hoşçakallar<br/><br/>Ayrıca, hizmet öncesi öğretmenlerin sınıflarıyla veya şiir ve yazı hakkında hizmet içi öğretmenlerin gruplarıyla sohbet ediyorum.<br/><br/>Büyük Sanal Ziyaret için İpuçları<br/><br/>Başarılı Bir Sanal Ziyaret İçin İpuçları<br/><br/>Sanal okul ziyaretleri için hedeflerimden biri, kişi içi ziyaretleri başarılı ve eğlenceli hale getiren etkileşimi yakalamaktır. Ancak gerçek şu ki, bazen sanal olarak etkileşimli olmak zor! Zamanlama doğru bir şekilde senkronize olmayabilir, bu da birlikte okumayı bir zorluk haline getirir ve ortaya çıkıp doğrudan mikrofona / bilgisayara konuşmadıkları sürece bireysel öğrencileri duymak benim için gerçekten zor. Ancak bazı deneme yanılmalardan sonra, mümkün olan en iyi sanal ziyaretlere sahip olmanın bazı yollarını keşfettim. İşte buradalar: Öğrencilerinizle ziyaretimi harika bir deneyim haline getirmenin 10 yolu!<br/><br/>Ziyaretten önce<br/><br/>Çocukları ziyaret hakkında mümkün olduğunca heyecanlandırın. Onlarla web sitemi ziyaret edin. Onlarla bazı kitaplarımı okuyun. Öğrencilerin benim için sahip olduğu bazı soruları toplayın. Büyük bir anlaşma gibi hissettirmek için önceden yaptığınız her şey öğrenci katılımına doğru uzun bir yol kat edecektir.<br/><br/>Video kamerayı veya dizüstü bilgisayarı webcam ile konumlandırın, böylece izleyicilerin mümkün olduğunca çoğunu görebilirim. Sadece birkaç öğrenciyi görebildiğimde öğrenci katılımını değerlendirmek zordur.<br/><br/>Her grubu 50 öğrenciyle sınırlayın. Video aracılığıyla büyük gruplarla bağlantı kurmak inanılmaz derecede zordur.<br/><br/>Konudan konuya veya şiirden şiire hızla geçeceğim. Lütfen öğrencilere neler olduğunu anlamak için yakından dinlemeleri gerektiğini hatırlatın.<br/><br/>Bazen öğrencilerle birlikte küçük bir Reader's Theater yapıyorum. Size önceden yazılmış herhangi bir öğrenci parçasını gönderirsem, her seans için bir kopya yazdırın ve gerekirse parçalara bölün.<br/><br/>Ziyaret sırasında<br/><br/>Bir kitabı tartışırken, eğer o basılı kitabınız varsa, lütfen öğrencilerin görmesi için basılı tutun.<br/><br/>Sen benim vekilimsin. Sık sık öğrencileri arayamıyorum ve bireysel yanıtları duyamıyorum. Bu yüzden, "3 fikir alacağız. Bir fikrin varsa elini kaldır" diyebilirim. Sonra siz devralın, üç öğrenciyi çağırın ve bu cevapları odadaki herkese ve bana duyurun.<br/><br/>Senaryolu öğrenci bölümleri için kendinden emin, giden öğrencileri seçin (eğer önceden gönderirsem). Şahsen okul ziyaretlerim sırasında, daha az özgüvenli öğrencilerden bazılarını çizmeye çalışıyorum, ancak sanal ziyaretler sırasında bunun iyi çalışmadığını, çünkü onları duyamadığımı gördüm.<br/><br/>Konuşan kısımları olan öğrenciler önde otursunlar. Zamanı geldiğinde ayağa kalkmalarını sağlayın ve yüksek sesle konuşmalarını hatırlatın.<br/><br/>Sanal ziyaretlerde, davranış yönetimi sadece size düşer. Genellikle tam olarak ne olduğunu göremiyorum, bu yüzden lütfen gerektiği gibi adım atın. Eğer büyük bir aksama varsa, sadece bir dakika beklememi isteyin, böylece kimse dikkat etmezken gevezelik etmem:><br/><br/>Ekranda fotoğrafımı çekmekten ve sosyal medyada paylaşmaktan çekinmeyin - resimlerim genellikle saçma görünse de, çünkü okurken komik yüzler veya bir şeyler yapıyorum!<br/><br/>Herhangi bir sorunuz varsa, lütfen ziyaretten önce veya ziyaret sırasında sorun!<br/><br/>Sanal Oturum Planlaması<br/><br/>Benimle sanal bir ziyaret planlamakla ilgileniyor musunuz?

On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Haber Arşivi<br/><br/>Yeni kitap, HIV ile mücadele etmenin yollarını araştırıyor<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Kitabın kapağını tasarlayan Marjorie Human'dan Prof. Dennis Francis, HIV üzerine hareket ediyor.<br/><br/>HIV pandemisi, yanıt açısından insanlarda en iyi ve en kötüyü ortaya çıkardı. Bir yandan damgalanmaya ve şiddete yol açtı, diğer yandan çeşitli birey ve gruplardan yapıcı ve destekleyici tepkiler getirdi. Özgür Devlet Üniversitesi Eğitim Fakültesi Dekanı Prof. Dennis Francis tarafından düzenlenen yeni bir kitap olan Acting on HIV, dramanın yaşamsal sosyal değişimi ve bireysel davranış değişikliğini teşvik etmek için nasıl kullanılabileceğine bakıyor.<br/><br/>HIV üzerine hareket etmek, HIV/AIDS ve ilgili tutum ve davranışları tartışmak için bir yaklaşım olarak dramaya sistematik bir soruşturma sunmaktadır.

Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Günün Emlak Kelimesi: Seçenek<br/><br/>Seçenek: Belirli bir süre için açık tutmak için bir anlaşma, gayrimenkul satmak veya kiralamak için bir teklif. Bir seçenek, örneğin, alıcıya satın alma işlemi yapmadan önce finansman, unvan, imar ve fizibilite sorularını çözmek için alıcıya zaman vermek için kullanılabilir. Seçenekler genellikle arazi birleştirme işleminde kullanılır. Bu seçenek, mülkün satın alma fiyatından ayrı ve bağımsız olarak gerçek göz önünde bulundurularak desteklenmelidir. Sadece dikkate alma resitali, kiralama hükümlerinin seçeneği desteklemek için yeterli olduğu bir kiralama seçeneği dışında yeterli değildir. Bir seçenek sadece sözleşmeye dayalı bir hak oluşturur; opsiyon sahibine mülkte herhangi bir mülk vermez. Seçenek imzalandığı sırada, mal sahibi ne satış yapar ne de alıcı satın alır, mülk. Her ne kadar mal sahibi alıcı tarafından bildirimde bulunursa satmakla yükümlü olsa da, alıcı satın almakla yükümlü değildir. Satın alma seçeneği de bir çağrı olarak bilinir; Satma seçeneği, bir put olarak bilinir. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Cilt için Karotenoidlerin Faydaları<br/><br/>Karotenoidleri duydunuz mu? Bu güçlü fitokimyasallar, çiçekler, meyveler veren ve sarı, turuncu ve kırmızı renklerini bırakan bitkilerde bulunan pigmentli bileşenlerdir.<br/><br/>1930'lardan beri bilim adamları, epidermisin en dış tabakası, dermis ve subkutan yağ da dahil olmak üzere insan vücudunda yaklaşık 800 karotenoid ve yaklaşık 40 tane bulunmuştur. En yaygın karotenoidler beta-karoten, alfa-karoten, lutein, zeaksantin, likopen ve astaksantindir. Burada astaksantin hakkında daha fazla bilgi edinebilirsiniz.<br/><br/>Ciltteki karotenoidlerin içeriği, meyve ve sebzelerin alımı, çeşitli gıdalardan biyoyararlanımı, takviye, UV radyasyonuna maruz kalma, hava kirliliği, alkol tüketimi, sigara ve stres gibi çok sayıda faktörden etkilenir.<br/><br/>Karotenoidler Cildime Nasıl Yardımcı Olur?<br/><br/>Karotenoidler cilt için en iyi bilinen antioksidanlardan bazılarıdır ve aynı zamanda anti-enflamatuar ajanlar olarak önemli işlevlere sahiptirler.<br/><br/>Sağlıklı Yaşlanma ve Cilt Onarımı<br/><br/>Antioksidanlar sağlıklı ciltler için gereklidir, çünkü hücrelere serbest radikal hasarı önlemeye yardımcı olurlar. Serbest radikal hasarı erken yaşlanmaya ve çeşitli cilt kanserlerinin başlangıcına neden olur. Karotenoidler, E vitamini, C vitamini ve Co enzimi Q10 ile birlikte önemli dermal antioksidanlardır.<br/><br/>Antioksidan aktivitelerinden dolayı karotenoidler ciltte kollajen ve elastin üretimini destekler ve teşvik eder. Bu, cildin yoğunluğunu, kalınlığını, elastikiyetini ve sağlamlığını artırmaya yardımcı olur. Kolajen ve elastin yaşlandıkça azalır, bu nedenle diyette ve topikal olarak yeterli karotenoid almak iyi yaşlanma için kritik öneme sahiptir.<br/><br/>Karotenoidler fotoğraflama, cilt renk değişikliği, elastikiyet, hidrasyon, doku belirtilerini iyileştirebilir ve transepidermal su kaybını azaltabilir.<br/><br/>Özellikle astaksantin, kolajen ve elastin üretmek için fibroblastları uyarır, kollajen ve elastin parçalayan enzimlerin aktivitesini inhibe eder ve anti-inflamatuar ve UV filtreleme etkileri gösterir.
