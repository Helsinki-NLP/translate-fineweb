| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - Raamatun C2000-sarjan kauttaKäännymme Apostolien tekojen ensimmäisen luvun puoleen, kun aloitamme alkuseurakunnan tutkimisen.<br/>Luukas, Apostolien tekojen kirjoittaja, apostoli Paavalin toveri, joka oli myös evankeliumin kirjoittaja Luukkaan mukaan, kirjoitti nämä kaksi tutkielmaa ystävälleen Theophilukselle. Theophilus on kreikkalainen nimi. Se on nimi, jolla on kaunis merkitys. Nimi tarkoittaa Jumalan rakastajaa. On joitakin, jotka uskovat, että se ei ollut ihminen ollenkaan, vaan että evankeliumi ja Apostolien teot oli osoitettu Jumalan rakastajille, kuka sitten lienetkin. Toisten perinteiden mukaan Theophilus oli itse asiassa Luukkaan isäntä - ja tuohon aikaan lääkärit olivat orjia, yleensä varakkaan mesenaatin orjia. Niin, että Luukkaan isäntä oli Teofilus, ja hän vapautti Luukkaan ollakseen Paavalin kanssa lähetysmatkoilla. Näin Luukas kirjoittaa takaisin entiselle isännälleen. Tämä on kirkon varhainen perinne, mutta sitä on tietenkin mahdotonta todistaa, kuten niin monia perinteitä.<br/>On myös niitä, jotka uskovat, että kun Paavali oli Trooaassa ja hän sai näyn miehestä, joka kutsui häntä sanoen: "Tule yli Makedoniaan ja auta meitä", että tuo mies Paavalin näyssä ei ollut kukaan muu kuin Luukas. Sillä ensimmäinen, jonka Paavali todella tapasi tullessaan Makedoniaan, oli Luukas, ja kuten me olemme Apostolien teoissa, niin te tulette huomaamaan, että kun me pääsemme siihen Apostolien tekojen osaan, niin Luukas alkaa kirjoittaa enemmän ensimmäisessä persoonassa kuin kolmannessa persoonassa. Niin on ilmeisesti tässä nimenomaisessa Apostolien tekojen kohdassa, että Luukas tuli Paavalin kumppaniksi ja alkoi matkata hänen kanssaan. Hän alkoi käyttää pronomineja "me" ja "me" sijasta "he" ja "he". Tämä on epäilemättä paikka, jossa Luukas tuli osalliseksi ja silminnäkijäksi niistä asioista, joita tästä lähtien tapahtui. Tuomme tämän esiin teille, kun pääsemme siihen pisteeseen.<br/>Hän aloittaa Apostolien teot sitomalla sen evankeliumiin Luukkaan mukaan. On mielenkiintoista, että aivan viimeinen asia, jonka Luukas kirjaa evankeliumiinsa, on aivan ensimmäinen asia, jonka hän kirjaa Apostolien tekoihin. Havaitsemme Luukkaan evankeliumin päättyvän, kun Jeesus käskee opetuslastensa odottaa Jerusalemissa, kunnes heidät varustetaan voimalla korkeudesta. Ja sitten Jeesus nousi ylös taivaaseen, ja niin hän sulkee evankeliumin. Avatessaan Apostolien teot hän kirjoittaa:<br/>Edellinen tutkielma [eli Evankeliumi Luukkaan mukaan] olen kirjoittanut sinulle, oi Teofilus, kaikesta, mitä Jeesus alkoi sekä tehdä että opettaa (Ap.t. 1:1),<br/>Avainsana aloitetaan. Evankeliumi Luukkaan mukaan ei ole koko kertomus Jeesuksen Kristuksen palveluksesta. Se on vasta Jeesuksen Kristuksen palvelutyön alku. Jeesus jatkaa ihmisten tarpeiden palvelemista. Jeesus jatkaa sairaiden parantamista. Jeesus jatkaa kuolleiden herättämistä. Jeesus jatkaa rakkautensa ja evankeliuminsa välittämistä maailmalle, vasta nyt Hän palvelee niiden opetuslasten kautta, jotka on voideltu Pyhällä Hengellään. Mutta Kristuksen palvelus jatkuu; pohjimmiltaan se on lähtökohta, jonka Luukas omaksuu Apostolien teoissa. Edellinen tutkielma kaikesta siitä, mitä Jeesus alkoi sekä tehdä että opettaa.<br/>Nyt sen vuoksi Apostolien teot on keskeneräinen kirja: siinä, että Herra jatkaa työtä tänäkin päivänä niiden elämän läpi, jotka ovat antautuneet olemaan Jumalan välikappaleita. Ollakseen Pyhän Henkensä johdattamana ja ohjaamana ja voitelemana, jatkaakseen Jeesuksen palvelutyötä maailmassa tänä päivänä. Nyt Jumala on säätänyt, että Hänen työnsä tulee suorittaa ihmisten välineillä. En sano, että se täytyy suorittaa. Jumala voi käyttää enkeliolentoja työssään, ja tulee aika, jolloin Jumala käyttää enkeleitä julistamaan evankeliumiaan ihmisille kaikkialla maailmassa. Ilmestyskirja, 14. luku, "Ensimmäinen taivaan keskellä lentävä enkeli, jolla on iankaikkinen evankeliumi" (Ilm. 14:6). Mutta tällä hetkellä Jumala on päättänyt käyttää inhimillisiä välineitä. Niin epätäydellisiä kuin ne saattavatkin olla, kuitenkin se on se, mitä Jumala on määrännyt käyttämään. Jännittävä asia siinä on, että Jumala käyttää minua ja Jumala käyttää sinua. Niin monta kertaa me rukoilemme pois, "Oi Herra, en voi puhua. En ole koskaan voinut puhua ennen tai edes nyt, Herra." Kuten Mooses yritti anoa pois Jumalan kutsua. Jeremiah sanoi: "Herra, olen vain lapsi; kukaan ei kuuntele minua." Ja meillä kaikilla on tekosyymme, miksi meitä ei voi käyttää. Eikö niin? Me kaikki tiedämme syyt, miksi Jumala ei voinut käyttää meitä.<br/>Kerran, kun Herra kutsui profeettaa tekemään työtään, hän sanoi: "Herra, lähetä kuka haluat." Herra sanoi: "Hei, olen kutsunut sinut." "Herra, hyvä idea; lähetä kuka haluat." Niin usein olemme siinä asemassa, "Herra, lähetä kenen tahansa kädestä, kuka tahansa paitsi minä Herra." Ja kuitenkin, Jumala on määrännyt käyttämään meitä.<br/>Nyt jokainen meistä voi näyttää omat epätäydellisyytensä, jokainen meistä voi osoittaa omat kyvyttömyytensä, ja me kaikki voimme löytää tekosyyn, miksi Jumala ei haluaisi käyttää minua, mutta silti Jumala on päättänyt käyttää sinua. Ihmettelet, milloin Jumalalla on sellaisia välineitä, joilla hän saa työn tehtyä, eikö niin?<br/>Siihen päivään asti, jona hänet otettiin ylös, sen jälkeen kun hän oli Pyhän Hengen kautta antanut käskyt apostoleille, jotka hän oli valinnut (Ap.t.1:2):<br/>Hän päätti Luukkaan evankeliumin siihen päivään, jolloin Jeesus otettiin ylös, sen jälkeen kun Hän oli käskenyt apostoleita odottamaan voiman varustusta.<br/>Jolle hän myös [se on apostolit hän myös] osoitti itsensä eläväksi heille intohimonsa [tai kuolemansa] jälkeen monilla erehtymättömillä todisteilla (Ap. t. 1:3).<br/>Jeesuksen Kristuksen ylösnousemuksen tosiasiaa on vaikea kiistää. Olin huvittunut sekä ärsyyntynyt ja ärsyyntynyt eräästä Santa Anan rekisteristä lukemastani kirjoituksesta viime lauantaina. Kreivikunnissa esitellyistä luomistieteistä ja evoluutioteorioista. Kuinka niin, tämä yksi professori sanoi, että hän opettaa tiedeluokkaa, ja näin ollen he käsittelevät vain tosiasioita, ja että heillä ei ole sijaa teorioille. Koska tiede perustuu tosiasioihin ja luominen perustuu uskonnollisiin taikauskoihin, uskonnollisten teorioiden uskominen vaatii paljon uskoa, kun on kyse tosiasioista, ne voi vain hyväksyä. Ajattelin: "Erittäin mielenkiintoista siinä tiedeluokassa, he opettivat minulle, että se oli tosiasia, että maailma oli neljä miljardia vuotta vanha. Nyt he opettavat, että se on tosiasia, että maailma on kaksitoista miljardia vuotta vanha. Eikä siitä ole kovinkaan kauaa, kun kävin koulua."<br/>On mielenkiintoista, että Raamattua ei ole koskaan tarvinnut tarkistaa tai päivittää vastaamaan nykyisiä tietoja, joita ihmiset ovat löytäneet. Ja kuitenkin, jos ottaisit lukion luonnontieteiden oppikirjani tänään ja yrittäisit opettaa niistä tiedeluokkaa, huomaisit, että monia asioita, joita opetettiin tieteellisinä tosiasioina ollessani lukiossa, ei enää tunnusteta tieteellisiksi tosiasioiksi. Yksinkertainen solun protoplasma ei ole enää yksinkertainen solu, vaan äärimmäisen monimutkainen. Jos on olemassa jokin tosiasia, joka voidaan todistaa historiassa, niin se on Jeesuksen Kristuksen kuolleistanousun tosiasia.<br/>Meillä on oikeuskäytäntö, joka perustuu todistajien todistukseen. Jos ihmistä syytetään rikoksesta ja on olemassa ihmisiä, jotka todistivat tuon rikoksen sen tapahtuessa, ja heidät saatetaan normin tasalle, ja he vannovat kertovansa totuuden, koko totuuden, eikä mitään muuta kuin totuuden, niin auta heitä Jumalaa. Ja heidän kuulustelussaan he vakuuttavat, että: "Näin sen miehen pankissa 23. toukokuuta, näin hänen vetävän aseen takistaan, kuulin hänen vaativan, että kaikki rahat annettaisiin hänelle, näin hänen poistuvan pankista. Näin hänet, kun konstaapeli pidätti hänet ulkona." Ja jos saat kolme tai neljä todistajaa osoittamaan tuota miestä ja pitämään heidän todistuksensa ristikuulustelussa, tuo mies tuomitaan syylliseksi. Hän on se, joka teki sen. Meillä on kaksi tai kolme todistajaa, jotka todistavat samaa tarinaa tuosta miehestä, ja se hyväksytään tosiasiaksi, että hän on se, joka syyllistyi rikokseen ja on syyllinen.<br/>Jeesuksen kuoleman jälkeen, kun Hän nousi jälleen, Hän ilmestyi monille eri ihmisille, jotka antoivat valallisen todistuksen siitä, että he näkivät Hänet. Että he puhuivat Hänelle, että Hän ilmestyi heille eri paikoissa erilaisissa olosuhteissa. Ja neljänkymmenen päivän ajan vieraili heidän luonaan, ja yhteen aikaan, jopa viisisataa ihmistä, jotka olivat kokoontuneet yhteen paikkaan, Hän ilmestyi. On vaikea vain heittää syrjään tai kieltää näiden ihmisten todistusta. Sen tekeminen on koko oikeusjärjestelmämme mustamaalaamista. Mutta ei vain sitä, että nämä miehet, jotka todistivat nähneensä ylösnousseen Herran, puhuneensa Hänelle, syöneensä Hänen kanssaan, he kaikki yhtä lukuun ottamatta kohtasivat väkivaltaisia kuolemia muiden ihmisten käsissä, koska he vakuuttivat kertomansa tarinan olevan totta. Puhut todistajista, jotka vannoivat kertovansa totuuden, koko totuuden, vain totuuden, - jos henkilön henkeä uhattaisiin sen todistajan takia, ja se oli valhe, - ainakin yksi heistä olisi murtunut painostuksen alla. He olisivat tunnustaneet koko huijauksen. "Hän osoitti itsensä eläväksi intohimonsa jälkeen monin erehtymättömin todistein."<br/>heidän nähtensä neljänkymmenen päivän ajan, puhuen heille Jumalan valtakuntaan liittyvistä asioista (Ap.t.1:3):<br/>Joskus syytämme opetuslapsia heidän kysymyksistään Jumalan valtakunnan ajoituksesta. Muistettakoon, että Jumalan valtakunta oli Jeesuksen Kristuksen lempiaihe. Hän puhui aina Jumalan valtakunnasta, ja on suuri toivo, että Hän istutti kaikkien ihmisten sydämiin. Asiat eivät tule aina jatkumaan turmeltuneina sellaisina kuin ne ovat. Maailma ei mene ikuisesti pimeyden vallan alle, pahuuden orjuuteen. Jumala tulee eräänä päivänä perustamaan valtakuntansa maan päälle. Vanhurskaan ilon ja rauhan valtakunta. "Jeesus hallitsee, jossa ennen kuin aurinko juoksee hänen peräkkäiset matkansa, ja hänen valtakuntansa ulottuu rannasta rantaan." Ja se päivä on oleva loisteliain päivä, jonka maailma on koskaan nähnyt, kun sairaudet ja kärsimykset ja tuskat hävitetään Hänen valtakunnastaan, kun synti ja ahneus ja nämä asiat, jotka ovat tehneet maailmasta niin sietämättömän paikan, hävitetään Hänen valtakunnastaan. Jumalaton kaupallisuus, ihmisen riisto, kaikki nämä asiat lakkautettiin Hänen loistoisassa valtakunnassaan, kun Hän hallitsee. Ei ihme, että opetuslapset olivat innokkaita saamaan sen päälleen. Olen innokas saamaan sen päälle; olen innokas Hänen valtakuntansa tulemisesta. Ja Jeesus kertoi meille, kun rukoilemme, ensimmäinen anomus on: "Tulkoon sinun valtakuntasi. Tapahtukoon sinun tahtosi myös maan päällä niin kuin taivaassa" (Matt 6:10 ). Tämä on oikeanlainen halu, joka meillä kaikilla tulisi olla. Kaipaan Jumalan valtakuntaa. Ja niin hän puhui heille tänä neljänkymmenen päivän aikana valtakunnasta.<br/>Ja kun hän oli kokoontunut heidän kanssaan, hän käski heitä, etteivät he lähtisi Jerusalemista, vaan odottaisivat Isän lupausta, jonka te, sanoo hän, olette kuulleet minusta (Ap. t. 1:4).<br/>Hän sanoi: "Katsokaa, odottakaa täällä Jerusalemissa, kunnes saatte Isän lupauksen." Tämä lupaus, johon hän viittaa, on epäilemättä Jooelin lupaus, jossa Herra lupasi: "Ja myöhempinä aikoina, sanoo Herra, minä vuodatan Henkeni kaiken lihan päälle, ja teidän poikanne ja tyttärenne profetoivat, ja teidän nuorukaisenne näkevät unia, teidän vanhuksenne näkevät näkyjä, ja minun palvelijaini ja palvelijattarieni päälle minä vuodatan Henkeni, sanoo Herra" (Joe 2:28-29). Isän lupaus: se päivä tulee, jolloin Jumala vuodattaa Henkensä kaiken lihan päälle, kaikkien uskovien päälle. He saavat, kukin, tuon dynamiikan Jumalalta.<br/>Sillä Johannes [Hän sanoi] todella kastoi vedellä, mutta teidät kastetaan Pyhällä Hengellä ei monta päivää tästä eteenpäin (Ap. t. 1:5).<br/>Kasteen idea oli emersion, bapteedzo. Johannes kastoi vedellä, upotti ihmiset veteen, "sinä tulet olemaan upoksissa Pyhässä Hengessä ei montaa päivää."<br/>Kun he siis olivat kokoontuneet, kysyivät he häneltä sanoen: "Herra, tällä kertaako sinä käännät kuninkuuden Israelille?" (1:6).<br/>"Milloin se tulee olemaan, Herra? Milloin on tämän ennallistamisen aika?" Ja Jeesus puhuu heille nyt, ei valtakunnasta, vaan voimasta, jonka he tulevat saamaan palvelukseen. Ja niin Hän harjaa sivuun heidän kysymyksensä.<br/>Sanoen heille: Ei ole teidän asianne tietää aikoja eikä aikoja, jotka Isä on omaan voimaansa pannut (1:7).<br/>"Ei ole sinun asiasi tietää." He elivät jatkuvasti odottaen valtakunnan välitöntä perustamista. Koko Jeesuksen elinaikana he odottivat Häntä minä hetkenä hyvänsä menemään puhelinkoppiin ja tulemaan esiin maailman pelastajana. Shazzam! Osoittaen voimansa ja kukistaen maailman hallitukset, perustaen Jumalan valtakunnan maan päälle. Ja he odottivat päivittäin tämän muutoksen tapahtuvan. Ja aina kun Jeesus puhui Jerusalemiin menemisestä, syntisen ihmisen käsiin joutumisesta ja sitten ristiinnaulituksi tulemisesta, "Voi ei, Herra. Ei, sinä et ymmärrä valtakuntaa, Herra. Ole niin kaukana sinusta." Kun Jeesus kuoli ristillä, he kaikki olivat hyvin pettyneitä.<br/>Emmauksen tiellä olevat kaksi opetuslasta ovat niin surullisia. "Hei kaverit, miksi olette niin surullisia kuin kävelette eteenpäin?" "Mitä te tarkoitatte? Te olette varmaan muukalainen täällä, jos ette tiedä, mitä Jerusalemissa on tapahtunut viime aikoina." "Mitä asioita?" "Voi, mies nimeltä Jeesus Nasaretilainen... voi ihminen, se oli mahtava ja voimallinen. Jumalan voitelu oli hänen elämänsä päällä. Me olimme toivoneet, että Hänessä olisi Israelin pelastus, mutta he ristiinnaulitsivat Hänet. Me olimme toivoneet . . . nyt se on kuollut." Nyt Hän on noussut ylös, ja Hän sanoo: "Muutaman päivän kuluttua te saatte Isän lupauksen." "Voi, mikä lupaus? Lupaus valtakunnan perustamisesta?" Katsos, oli oikeutettua, että he kysyivät: "Onko tämä Herra? Onko nyt aika? Aiotko sinä perustaa valtakuntasi nyt? " Ei ole sinun asiasi tietää niitä aikoja, jolloin Isä on määrätty tai että Isällä on omassa vallassaan, vaan sinä saat voiman, kun Pyhä Henki on tullut päällesi."<br/>Nyt tässä käytetään kreikkalaista prepositioepiä merkitsemään uutta suhdetta, joka heillä oli oleva Pyhän Hengen kanssa. Evankeliumissa Johanneksen mukaan, 14. luvussa, koska Jeesus on siellä lupaamassa lähettää Pyhän Hengen, Hän sanoi: "En jätä teitä lohduttomiksi. Minä tulen teidän tykönne ja rukoilen Isää, ja hän lähettää teille toisen lohduttajan, totuuden Hengen, jota maailma ei voi ottaa vastaan, koska se ei näe häntä eikä tunne häntä, mutta te tunnette hänet, sillä hän asuu teidän luonanne, ja hän on teissä" (Joh 14:17-18). Sama kreikkalainen prepositio kuin meidän, vain he kirjoittavat sen "en" sijasta "in". Kaksinkertainen suhde siellä Johannes: Hän on teidän kanssanne, mutta Hän tulee asumaan teissä. Mutta nyt Jeesus sanoi, että te tulette saamaan voiman, kun Pyhä Henki tulee päällenne. Kreikan preposition epi, joka on käännetty eri teksteissä koko Uudessa testamentissa "päälle" tai "yli" tai pidän siitä, "ylivuoto".<br/>Johanneksen evankeliumin seitsemännessä luvussa: "Viimeisenä päivänä, suurena juhlapäivänä, kun Jeesus seisoi siellä Temppelivuorella ja huusi kansalle: 'Jos joku janoaa, tulkoon minun tyköni ja juokoon; ja joka juo sitä vettä, jota minä annan, hänen sisimmästään vuotaa elävän veden virtoja.'" Johannes sanoi: "Tämän hän puhui Hengestä, jota ei vielä ollut annettu, jonka niiden, jotka uskovat häneen, tulisi saada" (Joh 7:37-39). Mitä hän puhui Hengestä? Että se olisi kuin elävän veden virta, joka virtaa ulos. Pidän siitä, että "Kun Henki tulvii ylitsesi", päällesi, tai ylitsesi, tai vuotaa sinusta. Niinpä kolminkertainen suhde: Hän on kanssasi ennen kääntymystäsi, Hän on se, joka saa sinut tajuamaan, että olet syntinen, Hän on se, joka viittaa Jeesukseen Kristukseen vastauksena, kun Hän vakuuttaa maailman synnistä, vanhurskaudesta ja tuomiosta. Sillä hetkellä, kun avaat elämäsi ja sydämesi Jeesukselle Kristukselle ja kutsut hänet sisään, Pyhä Henki tulee ja alkaa asua sinussa. Hän tulee olemaan sinussa. "Ettekö tiedä, ettette ole omianne, te olette kalliisti ostetut; sentähden kirkastakaa Jumalaa ruumiissanne ja hengessänne, jotka ovat hänen. Ettekö tiedä, että teidän ruumiinne on Pyhän Hengen temppeli, joka teissä on? Älkää juopuko viinistä, jossa on ylenpalttisuutta, vaan täyttykää tai täyttykää Hengellä" ( 1Co 6:19-20 , Ef 5:18 ). Mutta nyt on kolmas suhde. Tämä on voimaannuttava kokemus.<br/>Saatte [dunamuksen] dynamiikan, kun Pyhä Henki on tullut teidän päällenne [tai teidän päällenne, tai kun teistä on tullut ylitsevuotavainen]: ja te tulette olemaan minun todistajiani (Ap. t. 1:8 ).<br/>Ja niin dynaaminen, olla Jeesuksen Kristuksen todistaja. On mielenkiintoista, että sana todistus kreikaksi on sana martus, josta saamme sana marttyyri. Ja kreikaksi se tarkoittaa marttyyria. Todistaja ei ainoastaan julista mitä uskoo, hän elää mitä uskoo, hän on mitä uskoo, ja hän uskoo sen niin vahvasti, että tarvittaessa hän kuolee sen puolesta mihin uskoo. Et voi estää häntä, hän ei pelkää kuolla uskonsa vuoksi.<br/>Muistatko, kun Paavali oli paluumatkalla Jerusalemiin ja Agabus tuli alas Kesareasta ja otti Paavalin vyön ja sitoi itsensä ja sanoi: "Niin sitokoon se mies, joka omistaa tämän vyön, kun hän pääsee Jerusalemiin." Ja Paulin ystävät alkoivat itkeä sanoen: "Paul, älä mene, älä mene." Ja hän sanoi: "Mitä sinä näillä kyynelillä tarkoitat? Luuletko, että saat minut luopumaan? Luuletko, että olen huolissani sidotuksi tulemisesta? Olen valmis kuolemaan." Hän oli martus. "Olen valmis kuolemaan." Kuolemaan joutuminen uskosi vuoksi ei tehnyt sinusta marttyyria; koska olit marttyyri, sinut surmattiin. Koska olit todistaja, koska uskoit siihen niin vahvasti. Se ei siis tehnyt sinusta todistajaa, se vain todisti mitä olit. Olit todistaja koko ajan. Jos et olisi ollut martus, et olisi koskaan mennyt kuolemaan. Olisit perunut; olisit sanonut: "Whoa, whoa, odota, odota. Odota, vaihdetaan kurssia täällä. Luulen, että olen tehnyt virheen." Sitten sanot: "No, hän ei ollut martus. Hevosen varastaminen ei tee sinusta hevosvarasta; se vain todistaa, että olit. Kukaan ei varasta hevosta, ellei hän ole hevosvaras. Joten sen varastaminen ei tee sinusta hevosvarasta, se vain todistaa, että olit koko ajan. Marttyyrinä oleminen todistaa vain sen, mitä olit todistajana, martus. "Ja te tulette olemaan todistajia." Ja eikö ole mielenkiintoista, että suurin osa heistä kärsi marttyyrikuoleman? "Todistajia minulle."<br/>Todistajan tuli olla sekä Jerusalemissa että koko Juudeassa (Ap. t. 1:8).<br/>Todistaja aloitti kotonaan - vaikeimmassa paikassa - aloittaa kotonaan Jerusalemissa - ja sitten Jerusalemin ympäristössä, Juudean alueella - ja levittäytyä sitten Samariaan. Ja sitten se oli mennä maailman ääriin ja kun tutkimme Apostolien tekojen kirjaa, näemme juuri tämän etenemisen. Miten todistus alkoi Jerusalemissa. Saamme sen seuraavassa luvussa. Ja sitten näemme, kuinka se alkoi levitä Juudeaan, ja sitten Filippus meni Samariaan, ja lopulta Paavali ja Barnabas kutsutaan lähtemään maailman ääriin. Ja niin todistus levisi voitelun ja Pyhän Hengen voimaannuttamisen kautta.<br/>Mutta kun hän oli tämän puhunut, nostettiin hänet heidän nähtensä, ja pilvi vei hänet pois heidän näkyvistään (1:9).<br/>Tämä on viimeinen lupaus, jonka Jeesus antoi opetuslapsilleen. Tämä on se, viimeiset sanat ennen Hänen taivaaseenastumistaan. Tietenkin myöhemmin Hän tuli ja puhui Paavalille ja muille, mutta ennen Hänen taivaaseenastumistaan, tämä on Hänen viimeinen sanansa. Ja tämän päälle, kun hän oli puhunut nämä asiat, heidän katsellessaan häntä, hänet otettiin ylös, ja pilvi otti hänet pois heidän näkyvistään.<br/>Ja heidän katsellessaan kiinteästi taivasta kohti hänen mennessään ylös, katso, siellä oli kaksi miestä, jotka seisoivat heidän vierellään valkeissa vaatteissa (Ap.t.1:10).<br/>Oletamme, että he olivat enkeleitä.<br/>jotka myös sanoivat: "Galilean miehet, miksi te seisotte ja katsotte ylös taivaaseen?" tämä sama Jeesus, joka otetaan teiltä ylös taivaaseen, tulee samalla tavalla, kuin olette nähneet hänen taivaaseen menevän (Ap. t. 1:11).<br/>He näkivät hänet, kun hän nousi taivaaseen, ja he näkevät hänet, kun hän tulee takaisin. "Katso, Herra tulee kymmenentuhannen pyhänsä kanssa panemaan täytäntöön tuomion maan päällä" (Tuom. 1:14-15). Ja sitten: "Hänelle, joka rakasti meitä ja antoi itsensä meidän puolestamme ja joka on tehnyt meidät meidän Jumalallemme, kuninkaille ja papeille, jotka tulevat hallitsemaan hänen kanssaan maan päällä, katso, Herra tulee, ja jokainen silmä saa nähdä hänet, ja myös ne, jotka lävistivät hänet, tulevat suremaan" Ilm 1:5-7). Niin Herra tulee. Jokainen silmä saa nähdä Hänet. Jehovan todistajat sanovat, että Hän on jo tullut, mutta se oli salainen tuleminen. Koska vain opetuslapset näkivät Hänen menevän, vain Jehovan todistajien opetuslapset näkivät Hänen palaavan. Mutta Jeesus sanoi: "Jos he sanovat teille: 'Hän on tullut salassa ja mennyt salaiseen kammioon, älkää uskoko sitä'" (Matt 24:26).<br/>"Tämä sama Jeesus, joka otetaan teiltä ylös taivaaseen, on tuleva samalla tavalla kuin olette nähneet hänen taivaaseen menevän."<br/>Nyt on hyvin mielenkiintoinen jae II Johannes, jae 1:7 , "Sillä maailmaan on tullut paljon eksyttäjiä, jotka eivät tunnusta, että Jeesus Kristus on tullut lihassa." Se on valitettavasti huono käännös kreikan kielestä. Sillä tämä partisiippi on nykyisessä aikamuodossa ja tulisi kääntää "on tulossa lihassa". Ne, jotka kieltävät, että Jeesus Kristus on tulossa lihassa. Mitä Johannes sanoo heistä? "He ovat eksyttäjä ja antikristus. Katsokaa itse, ettemme kadota sitä, minkä olemme saaneet aikaan, vaan että saamme täyden palkan; sillä joka rikkoo eikä pysy Kristuksen opissa, hänellä ei ole Jumalaa. Joka pysyy Kristuksen opissa, hänellä on sekä Isä että Poika; ja jos joku tulee ovellesi (lauantaiaamuna) eikä tuo tätä oppia, älä ota häntä vastaan kotiisi äläkä jätä hänelle jäähyväisiä. Sillä se, joka hyvästelee hänet, on osallinen hänen pahoista teoistaan" (2 Joh 1:7-11). Kysy heiltä yksi kysymys: "Tuleeko Jeesus lihassa?" Kysy heiltä vain se kysymys. Ja jos he sanovat ei, muista vain, mitä Johannes varoitti sinua ja mitä Johannes kertoi sinulle. "Jos joku ei tunnusta, että Jeesus Kristus tulee lihassa." Muistatko, kun Hän oli opetuslasten kanssa ja Hän sanoi: "Anna minulle jotain syötävää?" Hän sanoi: "Tiedätkö, henget eivät syö; kosketa minua. Näetkö? Se olen minä." Niinpä tämä sama Jeesus tulee jälleen samalla tavalla, jolla he näkivät Hänen taivaaseen menevän. Ja minä puolestani uskon, että se tuleminen on hyvin pian.<br/>Sitten he virittyivät uudelleen Jerusalemiin vuorelta, jota kutsutaan öljymäeksi, joka on Jerusalemista sapatin päivämatka [noin kaksi kolmasosaa mailista]. Ja tultuaan sisään he menivät yläsaliin, jossa asuivat sekä Pietari että Jaakob ja Johannes ja Andreas ja Filippus ja Tuomas ja Bartolomeus ja Matteus, Jaakob, Alfeuksen poika, ja Simon Selootti ja Juudas, Jaakobin veli. Ja nämä kaikki pysyivät yksimielisesti rukouksessa ja anomisessa, naisten ja Marian, Jeesuksen äidin, ja hänen veljiensä kanssa (Ap.t.1:12-14).<br/>Tämä on viimeinen maininta Mariasta, Jeesuksen äidistä. Tässä vaiheessa ja tästä eteenpäin hänestä ei ole enää mainintaa Apostolien teoissa tai epistoloissa. Ei mainintaa hänen kuolemastaan tai ihmeellisestä taivaaseenastumisestaan, ilman kuolemaa. Raamatussa ei mainita mitään, se on vaiti.<br/>Hänen veljensä olisivat todennäköisesti viittaus Jaakobiin ja Juudaan sekä niihin muihin veljiin, jotka olivat Joosefin ja Marian poikia.<br/>Ylähuone – on joitakin, jotka sanovat, että se on sama ylähuone, jossa Jeesuksella oli viimeinen ehtoollinen opetuslastensa kanssa. Ja kuitenkin on toisia, jotka pitävät tätä ylähuonetta huoneena temppelialueella, jossa alkuseurakunta kokoontui. Tee valintasi.<br/>Ja niinä päivinä Pietari nousi seisomaan opetuslasten keskellä ja sanoi: (niiden nimien luku yhteensä oli noin satakaksikymmentä), miesten ja veljien, tämän raamatunkohdan on täytynyt täyttyä, jonka Pyhä Henki Daavidin suun kautta ennen puhui Juudaasta, joka oli opas niille, jotka ottivat Jeesuksen (Ap. t. 1:15-16).<br/>Tässäkin Pietari on yhä sama äkkipikainen itsensä, he odottavat rukouksessa ja anomuksessa, ja Pietari nousee ja sanoo: "Kaverit, on eräs raamatunkohta, joka täytyy täyttää." Ja te tiedätte, että hän menee eteenpäin: "Pannaan ohjelma käyntiin; heitetään arpaa ja selvitetään, kuka ottaa Juudaksen paikan." Minusta tuntuu, että Pietari oli jälleen lihassa, ilmentäen sitä äkkipikaista luontoa, joka oli hänen. Ja uskon, että seurakunnan tuleva historia Apostolien teoissa osoittaa tämän. Minua kiinnostaa Pietarin käsitys pyhistä kirjoituksista, kuinka hän lainaa niin monista paikoista Vanhassa testamentissa. Pietari kyllä osoittaa hyvin suurta ymmärrystä Vanhan testamentin raamatunkohtia kohtaan, joka on hänen suosiossaan.<br/>Huomaa, että Pietari liittää Pyhään Henkeen sen, mitä Daavid kirjoitti, niin että "koko kirjoitus on Jumalan henkeyttämä" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Koska jos kerrot, että osa pyhistä kirjoituksista on annettu Jumalan innoittamana, silloin minun täytyy kysyä sinulta: "Mitkä osat ovat innoituksesta ja mitkä osat eivät ole innoituksesta?" Sitten sinä olet auktoriteetti, joka kertoo mihin osaan voin uskoa ja mihin osaan en voi uskoa ja heti kun Jumala ei ole enää auktoriteetti vaan sinä olet auktoriteetti, olen pulassa. Varokaa niitä, jotka sanovat: "No, ette voi uskoa kaikkia pyhiä kirjoituksia." Kirjoitukset itse sanovat: "Koko Raamattu on annettu Jumalan henkeytyksestä." Ja tässä, Luukas kirjallisesti siitä, mitä Pietari sanoi, julistaa, että Daavid oli itse asiassa Pyhän Hengen puhemies. Pyhä Henki Daavidin suun kautta puhui Juudaasta.<br/>Sillä hänet luettiin meidän kanssamme, hän oli yksi niistä kahdestatoista, hän oli saanut osan tästä palveluksesta. Mutta nyt tämä mies osti pellon vääryyden palkalla ja putosi pää edellä (Ap.t.1:17-18).<br/>Hän osti pellon, savenvalajan pellon, kuten Zachariah yhdestoista luku julistaa.<br/>ja putosi pää edellä, hän repesi kahtia keskellä, ja kaikki hänen sisuksensa pulppusivat ulos (Ap. t. 1:18).<br/>On niitä, jotka löytävät ristiriitoja pyhistä kirjoituksista, koska yhdessä evankeliumissa meille kerrotaan, että kun Juudas tuli takaisin ja yritti palauttaa rahat, ja he sanoivat: "Hei, se on sinun ongelmasi. Emme voi ottaa sitä." Ja laita se takaisin temppelin kassaan. "Se on verirahaa." Sitten hän heitti sen temppelin lattialle ja meni ulos ja hirttäytyi. Tässä Peter kertoo, että hän putosi pää edellä ja vain piipahti. Ja on niitä, jotka kuvittelevat ristiriitaa. Hyvin yksinkertaista, hän meni puuhun hirttämään itsensä, sitoi köyden kaulaansa ja sitoi sen raajaan ja hyppäsi. Ja putoamisen voima joko katkaisi köyden tai pään, ja hän putosi alas kanjoniin ja aivan kuten hän sanoi sen tässä.<br/>Se oli kaikkien Jerusalemin asukkaiden tiedossa, niin että peltoa kutsutaan heidän kielellään Acheldamaksi, toisin sanoen veripelloksi. Sillä Psalmien kirjaan on kirjoitettu: "Tulkoon hänen asuinsijansa autioksi, älköön siinä asuko ihminen, ja hänen piispanvirkansa ottakoon toinen" (Ap.t.1:19-20).<br/>Nyt hän todellisuudessa lainaa kahta eri psalmia tässä. Psa 69:25 , hän laittaa sen yhteen Psa 109:8 . Ja laskemalla nämä kaksi yhteen hän löytää nämä Juudasta koskevat profetiat.<br/>Miksi nämä miehet (Ap. t. 1:21 )<br/>Nyt he etsivät jotakuta, joka ottaisi Juudaksen paikan apostolina. Tässä ovat heidän tuona aikana etsimänsä pätevyysvaatimukset.<br/>Sen tähden näistä miehistä, jotka ovat olleet meidän kanssamme kaiken sen ajan, jonka Herra Jeesus meidän keskellämme ja ulkona ollessaan (Ap. t. 1:21 )<br/>Nyt muistat, että oli monia opetuslapsia, joista Jeesus valitsi kymmenen apostoleiksi. Ja sana apostoli tarkoittaa "yhtä, joka on lähetetty". Tai valitsi kaksitoista apostoleiksi, joten Hän lähetti ne kaksitoista. Ihmishallituksen lukumäärä. "Meillä on vain yksitoista. Me tarvitsemme yhden ottaaksemme Juudaksen paikan, mutta tarvitsemme yhden, joka on ollut kanssamme alusta asti Jeesuksen kanssa."<br/>Siitä ajasta, jolloin Johannes kastoi hänet, siihen päivään asti, jona hänet otettiin ylös meistä, täytyy hänet asettaa hänen ylösnousemuksensa todistajaksi (Ap. t. 1:22).<br/>Nämä olivat siis ne vaatimukset, joita he etsivät, joku, joka oli ollut olemassa koko ajan, Johanneksen kasteesta taivaaseen astumiseen asti, ja se, joka näki ylösnousseen Herran, ja siten saattoi kantaa ylösnousemisen tosiasiaa, heidän todistuksensa siitä.<br/>Nyt apostoli Paavali, myöhemmin väittäessään olevansa apostoli, sanoi: "Enkö ole nähnyt ylösnoussutta Kristusta?" Ilmeisesti se oli yksi apostoliuden vaatimuksista. Joku kysyi minulta: "Onko tänään apostoleja?" No, en tiedä. En usko, että on olemassa samassa mielessä kuin ne olivat Uudessa testamentissa. Varmasti ei ole nykyään ketään, joka voisi todistaa ylösnousemuksesta niin kuin he tekivät.<br/>He nimittivät kaksi, Joosefin nimeltä Barsabas, jota kutsuttiin lisänimellä Justus, ja Mattiaan. Ja he rukoilivat ja sanoivat: "Sinä, Herra, joka tunnet kaikkien ihmisten sydämet, osoita, kummanko näistä kahdesta olet valinnut" (Ap.t.1:23-24).<br/>Luulen, että teemme usein tämän virheen antamalla Herralle kaksi vaihtoehtoa, molemmat väärin. Jumalan rajoittaminen, näet. Olemme niin taipuvaisia tekemään tämän. Ilmeisesti Paul oli Jumalan valinta. Peter oli äkkipikainen, ja aseen yli hyppääminen sanoi: "Hei, meidän täytyy tehdä jotain, tiedäthän, meidän täytyy auttaa Jumalaa ulos. Yksi puuttuu ja meidän täytyy täyttää hänet." Ja silti, "Jumala, kumman näistä kahdesta sinä haluat?" Ja antaa Jumalalle kaksi vaihtoehtoa.<br/>että hän saisi osansa tästä palveluksesta ja tästä apostolinvirasta, josta Juudas rikkomuksen kautta lankesi, että hän pääsisi omalle paikalleen. Ja niin he antoivat arpansa (Ap.t. 1:25-26);<br/>Mielenkiintoinen tapa, jolla he pyrkivät selvittämään Jumalan tahdon. Heitetään noppaa, selvitetään, mikä Jumalan tahto on täällä. Mielenkiintoinen minulle, eri tapoja, että ihmiset ovat keksineet erottaa Jumalan tahdon. Nyt, Vanhan Testamentin aikoina heillä oli mielenkiintoinen tapa tulla papin luo, joka tiedustelisi Herralta heidän puolestaan urimin ja tummimin, "valojen ja täydellisyyksien", kautta. Juuri mitä nämä urim ja tummim olivat, sitä emme tiedä. Olen varma, etteivät ne olleet ne värilliset lasit, jotka Joseph Smith löysi Kultaisten Tablettien kanssa; taikalasit, että kun laitat ne jalkaasi, voisit yhtäkkiä lukea hieroglyfikirjoituksen.<br/>On niitä, jotka sanovat, että urim ja tummim olivat itse asiassa mustavalkoinen kivi, jota käytettiin papin rinnassa olevassa pussissa. He rukoilivat ja kysyivät Herralta erityisen kysymyksen. Muistat, että Daavid esitti Herralle määrätyt kysymykset: "Herra, lähdemmekö me filistealaisia vastaan?" Vastaus oli: "Ei." Niinpä taas seuraavana päivänä: "Herra, lähdemmekö me filistealaisia vastaan?" Vastaus oli: "Kyllä." "Milloin lähdemme?" He kysyivät erityisiä kysymyksiä, ja Herra ohjasi heidät urimin ja tommin kautta. He sanovat, että pappi rukoilisi, etsisi Jumalaa, ja sitten kurkottaisi sisään ja vetäisi esiin toisen kahdesta kivestä. Jos se oli valkoinen kivi, se oli kyllä-vastaus. Jos se olisi ei, niin se olisi musta kivi, jonka hän vetäisi pois. Jotkut jopa sanovat, että saamme termin blackballed tästä urim ja tummim. Itse asiassa alkuperäisessä se on ei äänestää tiettyä hanketta tai ajatusta vastaan. Sitä, mitä urim ja tummim olivat, emme tiedä, mutta Vanhan testamentin aikana he käyttivät arpaa Jumalan tahdon määrittämiseen.<br/>Niinpä tässä opetuslapset huomaavat saman asian kuin heittävät noppaa nähdäkseen, kumman kahdesta toverista Jumala oli valinnut Juudas Iskariotin tilalle.<br/>arpa lankesi Mattiaalle; hänet luettiin niiden yhdentoista joukkoon (Ap.t.1:26).<br/>Nyt kuka maailmassa on Matthias? Kukaan ei ole koskaan kuullut hänestä ennen tai jälkeen. On mielenkiintoista tavata Matthias ja selvittää, kuka hän on ja mitä hän teki. Luulen, että myöhemmästä historiasta on ilmeistä olettaa, että Jumala valitsi Paavalin apostoliksi. Paavali julistaa sen itse. Nyt tämä on viimeinen kerta, kun luemme heistä, jotka pyrkivät erottamaan Jumalan tahdon arpaa heittämällä tai sattumanvaraisesti.<br/>Tunnen tänään erään toverin, joka pyrkii erottamaan Herran tahdon, rukoilee ja esittää Herralle kysymyksen. Hänellä on kymmenen penniä taskussaan ja rukoillessaan hän ottaa penniä silmät kiinni ja laittaa ne pöydälle, ja jos ne kaikki nousevat päät ylös, se on kyllä. Mielenkiintoinen asia, aina silloin tällöin, ne kaikki nousevat päälaelleen, ja se on aika hyvä todennäköisyys, mutta emme kuitenkaan löydä mitään kaavaa tälle Pyhän Hengen antamisen jälkeen. Kun Pyhä Henki tuli seurakuntaan, alkoi Pyhä Henki puhua heille ja ohjata heitä. Ja Pyhä Henki sanoi: "Erottakaa minulle Paavali ja Barnabas siihen palvelukseen, johon minä olen heidät kutsunut" (Ap. t. Ja Pyhä Henki lähetti heidät eteenpäin, joten huomaamme Pyhän Hengen ohjaavan kirkkoa suoremmin. Kun Pyhä Henki tuli, tämä heitto noppaa saadakseen selville Jumalan tahdon asetettiin sivuun.<br/>"<br/><br/>Kuningas Jaakon käännös<br/><br/>Tämä on vuoden 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (tunnetaan myös nimellä Authorized Version).

Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

Stalinin vastustus puolueen sisällä, mukaan lukien Buharin, Jagoda ja Rykov, puhdistettiin näissä näytösoikeudenkäynneissä, sillä Stalin pakotti heidät manipuloivasti tunnustamaan vallankaappauksen suunnittelun ja valtion vastustamisen rikokset, vaikka todisteita ei ollut. Gabor T Rittersporn sanoi: "Monet uhreista olivat vilpittömästi omistautuneet bolshevismin periaatteille." Tämä vahvistaa todisteita siitä, että bolsevikki-ihanteet, jotka olivat aikoinaan olleet kommunistisen puolueen juuria, joutuivat Purgesin epäjärjestykseen ja tuhoon. Puolue oli tyhjentynyt ja entiset jäsenet katsoivat avuttomana Stalinin käyttävän suurta puhdistusta välineenä Venäjän muuttamiseksi yksipuoluevaltiosta haastamattomaksi diktatuuriksi. Jälleen puhdistukset murskasivat bolsevikkivallankumouksen aikana muodostuneen kommunistisen puolueen puitteet. Tämä on samaa mieltä "Stalin-teloittajan" lähteen kanssa, sillä molemmat osoittavat manipuloivaa luonnetta, joka auttoi diktaattoria parantamaan otettaan Venäjän kurkusta.<br/>Manipuloivalla tavalla, jolla Stalin syytti kohdistettavaa vastustustaan puhdistusten aikana, arkisten venäläisten silmissä, oli myös implosiivinen vaikutus neuvostoyhteiskuntaan. Stalin pystyi keräämään kansalta tukea propagandan ja median avulla auttaakseen häntä kehittämään "persoonallisuuden kultin" ja sankarillisen ja urhean johtajan imagon. Tämän tuen avulla Stalin istutti epäluottamusta kansan mieliin vakuuttaen heille, että vallankumouksen petturit ja se, mitä hän kuvaili "kansanvihollisiksi", olivat heidän joukossaan.<br/><br/>Muut paperit Kuten se, mikä oli puhdistusten lyhytaikainen merkitys Venäjän hallitukselle ja yhteiskunnalle<br/><br/>1203 sanaa - 5 sivua<br/>Yhdysvaltain kauppataseen alijäämäToisesta maailmansodasta lähtien Yhdysvallat on solminut valtioiden kanssa eri puolilla maailmaa sopimuksia kansainvälisen kaupan ja investointien esteiden poistamiseksi.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell ärsytti tappelijoita tähtivoimien ärsytyksen sijaan. Olin viime kaudella 750:llä teholla 8 nita ja on hyvin vaikeaa ohittaa, että tähtivoimat ovat todella hallitsevassa roolissa. Myös matchmaking on roskaa. Kun pelaan jalokiveä (noin 600 pokaalia), on usein otteluita, joissa vihollisjoukkueella on yksi pelaaja enemmän kuin meillä, joka on maxed ja se ei ole edes sitä, että meillä on lvl 9 kilpailla sitä vastaan. Joskus on jopa matchups jossa vihollinen joukkue on täysin maxed ja kukaan meistä. siksi en pelaa rähinöidä tähteä vakavasti enää. Se ei ole edes kuin siellä arent monet pelaajat, jotka eivät ole maxed ja noin 600 pokaaleja. Se on ärsyttävää.<br/>Edit: Mielestäni supercellissä pitäisi olla ainakin perusmekanismi, joka vie tappelupelien tasojen keskiarvon otteluita perustettaessa.<br/><br/>Paitsi että pokaalit eivät kerro taidoistasi vaan joukkuetovereiden taidoista - ja minua ei haittaa pelata ylemmän tason tappelijoita vastaan, mutta kun toinen joukkue on kokonaan tasolla 10 ja toinen ei, se on selvästi epätasapainossa.<br/><br/>Olen recomend saada hyviä ystäviä pelata, minä ja 2 kaveria sai ystäväni teho 1 rasti listalla 28 pelaamalla helmi napata tietyn kokoonpanon koko päivän ja teimme sen ilman yhden meistä on maxed meidän tappelijat.<br/><br/>Tiedän miltä sinusta tuntuu, että minulla oli ennen rähinöitsijöitä korkeissa pokaaleja matalalla tasolla ja on vaikea mennä pidemmälle ja kaikki mitä sanoin itselleni "Haluan olla tähtivoimia" todella supersolun täytyy tasapainottaa tähtivoimia tai ainakin tehdä parempi matchmaking-järjestelmä.<br/><br/>Minusta tuntuu, etten ole yhtä hyvä pelissä kuin sinä, mutta sain Emzille 500 teholla 1 ja matchmaking oli kamalaa. Maxed pelaajia kaikkialla! Ja se ei auttanut, että suurin osa joukkuetovereistani oli noin 5-8k pokaalit... Jouduin turvautumaan viime hetken soolonäytökseen, koska voin joko väijyttää pahaa-aavistamattomia pelaajia tai yksinkertaisesti pelata hieman aggressiivisesti oikeaan aikaan. Mutta toivon todella, että se voisi olla hieman helpompaa ihmisille, jotka haluavat työntää tappelijoita todella korkeisiin pokaalialueisiin ilman tähtivoimien ylellisyyttä.<br/><br/>Altho piikki on edelleen hyvä ilman curveballia. Curveball oli vain apu laukauksien lyömiseen useammin piikinä. Mutta jo ennen curveballin julkaisua piikki oli todella vahva tappelija, joten hän pysyy nyt samana.<br/><br/>Olen samaa mieltä siitä, että heidän olisi pitänyt nerfed väijytys, mutta mielestäni he yrittävät tasapainottaa sekä Snappy Snipingin että Ambushin, koska he molemmat sulautuvat tähän muutokseen. Hän oli tulossa hieman voimakkaaksi, mutta ei silti nerf-arvoiseksi<br/><br/>En ole varma tästä, mutta nyt kun Darryl sai huomattavan buffin, katsomalla heidän uusia tilastojaan, näyttää siltä, että Darryl saattaa varjostaa Bullia, koska hän ei vain aina voi tehdä enemmän vahinkoa kuin Bull, hän ei enää kuole niin aikaisin, joten heidän selviytymiskykynsä on samanlainen ilman tähtivoimaa (vaikka Bullin selviytymiskyky on silti huomattavasti parempi kuin Darrylin, jos hänellä olisi Tough Guy). Paitsi, että Darrylin super voi uudistua automaattisesti, mikä tarkoittaa, että Darryl MIGHTia voidaan pelata tehokkaasti sekä raskaana että salamurhaajana samaan aikaan (ennen kuin hän imee raskaana, mutta kunnollisena salamurhaajana)<br/><br/>Mutta hän on yliarvostettu af. Ja saat pokaaleja hänen kanssaan todella helposti. Joten im kinda ok nerf. En ole edes pelannut häntä siitä lähtien, kun sain hänet 500: een (noin 5 kuukautta sitten), joten en välitä niinkään.<br/><br/>Miksi Poco/Penny ei saa HP:n nerfiä, jos ne ovat Marksman/Healer eivät vastaavasti tankkia?<br/>Miksi Rosan tankyness ei närkästy, yskä 70% vahinkojen vähentäminen?<br/>Miksi Tickillä saa olla koko pelin korkein kantama ja vapain pokedamage?<br/>Miksi Leon ei saa HP/Damage-biisiä?<br/><br/>Oli miten oli, se oli Ambush, joka oli OP, ei pohja Piper. Väittäisin, että Ambush on pelin paras tähtivoima (nyt vielä enemmän, koska vahinkojen prosentuaalinen kasvu epäsuorasti nousi) ja pohja Piper oli pohja-10 tappelija.<br/><br/>Supercellin pitäisi palauttaa molemmat hermosolut, vähentää Ambush 600:aan ja vähentää Snappy Sniping 0,25:een, koska se olisi epäsuorasti perusvaurion buffaama.<br/><br/>Yea ja minä uskomme, että he menivät hieman liian pitkälle Rosan kanssa, koska nyt hän on periaatteessa parempi härkä nyt, kun on kyse tankkaamisesta, mitä hän on ollut jonkin aikaa. Nyt Darryl voisi yhtä hyvin olla pienempi, voimakkaampi härkä<br/><br/>Hänen terveytensä ja nopeutensa tekevät hänestä super-hieman hankalamman käyttää, koska hän voi kuolla melko helposti, ja hänen on todella vaikea pyydystää nopeampia tappelijoita kuten Crow. Hänen tähtivoimansa on kuitenkin hieman rikki... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants.

It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Itsensä työllistäminen osa 1<br/><br/>Kun vastaanotat työpaikan missä tahansa organisaatiossa, sinun on tehtävä erilaisia töitä työnantajasi vaatimusten mukaisesti ja voit saada kiinteän määrän tuloja palkkana.
