| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. Since 2011, she has served as chair of the Democratic National Committee. Follow her on Twitter.<br/><br/>The Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff. | Neljäkymmentäyhdeksän vuotta sitten presidentti Lyndon B. Johnson allekirjoitti vuoden 1965 äänioikeuslain.<br/><br/>Mainos<br/><br/>Perustuslain 15. lisäys totesi lähes sata vuotta sitten, että "Yhdysvaltain kansalaisten äänioikeutta ei saa kieltää tai supistella Yhdysvaltojen tai minkään valtion taholta rodun, värin tai aikaisemman orjuuden vuoksi." Ja lähes vuosisataa ennen sitä kansakuntamme perustajaisät käynnistivät amerikkalaisen demokratian suuren kokeilun julistamalla, että "kaikki ihmiset on luotu tasa-arvoisiksi".<br/><br/>Vuoden 1965 äänioikeuslaki oli myöhäinen tunnustus siitä, että jopa Amerikassa perusaatteillamme on vain vähän painoarvoa, ellei niitä suojella oikeusvaltion periaatteella. Siksi 15. lisäyksen 2. pykälä myönsi kongressille "vallan panna tämä artikla täytäntöön asianmukaisella lainsäädännöllä".<br/><br/>Ja todellakin, äänioikeuslain kodifioitu kieli pystyi saavuttamaan sen, mitä jälleenrakennusajan kongressi ja Thomas Jefferson eivät voineet. Vuoden 1964 kansalaisoikeuslaki ja äänioikeuslaki - ja kansalaisoikeusliike, josta ne syntyivät - toimivat katalysaattorina mustien amerikkalaisten mahdollisuudelle osallistua demokraattiseen prosessiin.<br/><br/>Esimerkiksi vuonna 1962 vain 6,7 prosenttia äänioikeutetuista mustista mississippiläisistä oli rekisteröitynyt äänestäjiksi; vuoteen 1969 mennessä luku oli noussut 66,5 prosenttiin.<br/><br/>Äänioikeuslain säätämät suojat olivat jo pitkään myöhässä, kun ne hyväksyttiin, edustaen sitä vaivalloista kamppailua, jolla ne saavutettiin. Mutta käsittämättömän nämä suojaukset ovat nyt hyökkäyksen kohteena, vaarantaen edistyksen, jonka saavuttamiseksi kansakuntamme työskenteli niin kovasti.<br/><br/>Viime vuonna Shelby County v. Holderin tapauksessa Yhdysvaltain korkein oikeus perasi äänioikeuslain keskeisen komponentin, joka mahdollisti liittovaltion ennakkoarvioinnin syrjimättömyyden varmistamiseksi ennen uuden äänestyslain voimaantuloa.<br/><br/>Mainos<br/><br/>Valitettavasti republikaanijohtajien vastaus on ollut olla tekemättä mitään. Senaattori Ted Cruz ja kuvernööri Rick Perry menivät pois tieltään ylistämään korkeimman oikeuden päätöstä. Senaattori Rand Paul hylkäsi äänioikeuslain jatkuvan välttämättömyyden huomauttamalla, että "meillä on afroamerikkalainen presidentti".<br/><br/>Vaikka presidentti Barack Obaman valinta oli todellakin historiallinen virstanpylväs, on vaarallista ajatella, että se vapauttaa meidät valppaana pysymisestä kansakuntamme menneisyyden jatkuvia seurauksia vastaan. Kiire, jolla valtiot ovat siirtyneet säätämään äänestysrajoituksia, on vahvistus siitä, että pykälän 4 käyttöön ottamat suojat ovat edelleen tarpeen.<br/><br/>Mainos<br/><br/>Republikaanien kuvernöörit ovat allekirjoittaneet tiukat valokuvan tunnistamisrajoitukset lakiin ratkaisuna käytännössä olemattomaan ongelmaan äänestäjien imitoinnista, joka vahingoittaa suhteettomasti naisia, nuoria, työssäkäyviä perheitä ja afroamerikkalaista yhteisöä. On vilpillistä, että republikaanit kuten Paul hakevat näiden yhteisöjen ääniä, kun he uskovat, että "ei ole mitään vikaa" asettamalla rajoituksia, jotka vaikeuttavat näiden vaalipiirien äänestämistä.<br/><br/>Republikaanit ovat myös pyrkineet rajoittamaan varhaiset äänestysajat, mukaan lukien sunnuntai ennen vaalipäivää, jolloin afroamerikkalaisilla kirkoilla on ollut suuri menestys Soulsin kanssa Polls-ohjelmiin.<br/><br/>Mainos<br/><br/>Nämä rajoitukset edustavat republikaanien paatunutta pyrkimystä tehdä äänestämisestä vaikeampaa, joka perustuu kapea-alaisiin, lyhyen aikavälin poliittisiin laskelmiin, joiden mukaan republikaanit voivat voittaa vaalit pienentämällä äänestäjien kokoa.<br/><br/>Demokraateilla on hyvin erilainen tehtävä äänestämisessä: varmistaa, että jokainen äänioikeutettu voi rekisteröityä, että jokainen rekisteröity äänestäjä voi äänestää ja että jokainen ääni lasketaan tarkasti.<br/><br/>Mainos<br/><br/>Demokraattisen kansallisen komitean äänestäjien laajennusprojekti kuvastaa uskoamme siihen, että suurempi äänestäjien osallistuminen vahvistaa kansakuntaamme ja demokratiaamme. Jatkamme verrattoman institutionaalisen tietämyksemme käyttämistä suojellaksemme äänioikeutta lainsäädäntöä ja taktiikkaa vastaan, jotka yrittäisivät tukahduttaa äänestyksen. Ja koska paras puolustus on hyvä hyökkäys, pyrimme myös laajentamaan äänestystä ottamalla käyttöön teknologiamme ja tietoresurssimme uusien äänestäjien rekisteröimiseksi.<br/><br/>Tänä vuosipäivänä yksi parhaista tavoista, joilla voimme kunnioittaa niitä, jotka kamppailivat - ja joissain tapauksissa antoivat henkensä - sillä lainsäädännön kulku on, että kongressin republikaanit liittyvät demokraatteihin äänestysoikeuksien muutoslain hyväksymisessä palauttamaan vuoden 1965 äänioikeuslain lupauksen.<br/><br/>Mainos<br/><br/>Demokraatti Debbie Wasserman Schultz edustaa Floridan 23. kongressipiiriä Yhdysvaltain kongressissa. Vuodesta 2011 lähtien hän on toiminut demokraattien kansallisen komitean puheenjohtajana.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Q&A: Vatikaanin turvaamisen asiantuntija Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13. kesäkuuta 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Kuva: Australian jesuiitat.<br/><br/>Gregoriaanisen yliopiston lastensuojelukeskuksen puheenjohtaja Roomassa ja paavillisen alaikäisten suojelukomission jäsen Fr Hans Zollner SJ oli Australiassa vuonna 2018 puhumassa katolisen ministeriön johtajille ja eloonjääneille.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh jesuiittaviestinnästä istui hänen kanssaan vierailun aikana tutkimaan, miten kirkko vastaa hyväksikäyttökriisiin kansainvälisesti, ja mitä voimme oppia kokemuksistamme Australiassa.<br/><br/>MM: Tämä on kolmas matkasi Australiaan. Olet vieraillut melko monessa muussa maassa nähdäksesi, miten kirkko vastaa väärinkäytöksiin ympäri maailmaa. Voitko antaa meille jonkinlaisen käsityksen siitä, miltä globaali kuva näyttää?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: Käytyään noin 50 maassa viidellä tai kuudella mantereella käsitykseni on, että kirkko on todella alkanut siirtyä parin viime vuoden aikana kysymykseen siitä, tekeekö se oikeutta uhreille, kuunteleeko se heitä ja tekeekö se mitä tahansa turvaamisen suhteen.<br/><br/>Olin jesuiittojen maakuntien mukana eri puolilta Afrikkaa huhtikuun lopussa, ja Afrikan ja Madagaskarin jesuiittaavustajan presidentti on hyvin sitoutunut ja omistautunut tälle. Hän on laatinut perusteellisen toimintasuunnitelman muodostumista ja suuntaviivojen käyttöönottoa varten kaikkialla. Se on hyvin huomaavainen ja hyvin harkittu yritys tehdä mitä tahansa voidaan tehdä ollakseen proaktiivisesti sitoutuneita jesuiittoihin Afrikassa - mantereella, jossa vielä muutama vuosi sitten kaikki tämä oli vierasta kieltä.<br/><br/>Yksi tämän maailmanlaajuisen lähestymistavan kehittämisen haasteista on, että olet tekemisissä niin monien kulttuurien ja niin monien erilaisten käsitysten kanssa. Miten tuot tämän yhteen ja yrität tarjota koulutusta ja tukea uskonnollisille yhteisöille, jotka käsittelevät näitä asioita?<br/><br/>Tämä on yksi suurimmista kysymyksistä, joita meillä on.Mielestäni voin herättää keskustelua, herättää pohdintaa ja valmistaa ihmisiä mahdollisimman paljon, jotta he voivat tehdä pohjatyön.<br/><br/>Gregoriaanisen yliopiston lastensuojelukeskus ei esitä, että sillä olisi vastaus jokaiseen kysymykseen. Ei vain siksi, että emme tiedä erityisiä asiayhteyksiä - saatamme tuntea muutamia niistä, mutta puhumme tuhansista kulttuureista, puhumme sadoista kielistä, puhumme hyvin erilaisista oikeudellisista taustoista. Se vaihtelee joskus jopa yhden maan sisällä, kuten Australiassa, jossa on Australian liittovaltion osavaltioita, joilla on erilaiset lait kuin muilla osavaltioilla.<br/><br/>Olen henkilö, joka yrittää herättää keskustelua ja pohdintaa, ja kuuntelen myös mielelläni ihmisiä.<br/><br/>Mainitsitte tarpeen kuunnella ja tukea uhreja tulla kuulluksi, meillä on selvästi ollut kuninkaallinen komissio täällä Australiassa, mutta mitä muita tapoja olette nähneet, että uhrien ääniä tuetaan ympäri maailmaa?<br/><br/>Ranskassa on yksi hiippakunta, joka on perustanut niin sanotun "kuuntelutilan". Siellä uhrit voivat astua esiin ja ilmaista itseään. Piispa on paikalla. Se on avoin tila, jossa ihmiset, joita on satutettu suunnattomasti, ovat vapaita ainakin ilmaisemaan, mitä he haluavat pyytää kirkon johdolta jne.<br/><br/>Yhdysvalloissa tai muissa maissa on muitakin paikkoja, joissa hiippakunnat, maakunnat, kirkon johto ovat kutsuneet uhreja tulemaan esiin. Minun on sanottava, että kaiken kaikkiaan mielestäni on olemassa hyvä tahto, ja on enemmän piispojen ja maakuntien kaltaisia ihmisiä, jotka kuuntelevat uhreja kuin tiedämme. Mutta ei ole olemassa yhtä mallia, joka antaisi uhreille paitsi tilaa ilmaista itseään ja tulla kuulluksi, myös mahdollisuuden osallistua aktiivisesti kirkon kehittämiseen.<br/><br/>Mitä tulee tilojen perustamiseen uhrien tukemiseksi, mitä sellaisia asioita olet nähnyt, jotka voisivat todella auttaa - ja että voisimme harkita täällä Australiassa?<br/><br/>Yksi tärkeimmistä asioista, joita monet uhrit tuovat esiin, on: "Emmekö voi saada seurakunnan asetuksissa, koulujen asetuksissa, säännöllistä keskustelua, joka sisältää pahoinpitelystä selvinneitä komitean, komission, kaikulautakunnan, palauteryhmän tai jotain sellaista?" Niin, että tätä ääntä ei tuoda vain tiettyyn tilaisuuteen, tai jos henkilö tuntee olevansa siinä vaiheessa, että hän voi puhua siitä, vaan [kuullaan] säännöllisesti – rakenna tuo ääni järjestelmään.<br/><br/>Se auttaa meitä kaikkia, selviytyjiä ja uhreja, koska he tuntevat olevansa tervetulleita ja arvostettuja erityisessä kokemuksessa ja erityisissä elämänhaasteissa, joita he kävivät läpi. Toiseksi se auttaa yhteisöä laajemmin, koska voimme ainakin tehdä itsestämme yhä herkempiä sille, mitä eloonjääneiden huolenaiheet ja erityistarpeet ovat – ne voivat myös puhua nuorten tarpeista.<br/><br/>M: Meillä on täällä Australiassa vahvoja selviytyjäryhmiä, jotka ovat pystyneet tukemaan toisiaan tuon prosessin aikana. Tarkoitatko kuitenkin, että tarvitsemme jonkin keinon tukea noita ryhmiä ja ihmisiä myös omien instituutioidemme kautta?<br/><br/>Ja mielestäni meidän on oltava luovia, se toimii yhdellä tavalla yhdelle koululle ja yhdelle seurakunnalle ja yhdelle hiippakunnalle, ja toisille eri tavalla. Koska selviytyjillä, joiden kanssa olen jatkuvassa yhteydessä, on melko samanlaisia pyyntöjä ja samanlaisia kokemuksia kirkossa vastaanottamisesta tai hylkäämisestä – ulosheittämisestä tai erottamisesta. Mutta heillä on myös keskenään aivan erilaiset odotukset, joten olen oppinut, että teidän on myös oltava hyvin avoimia hyväksymään erot siinä, mitä tämä tietty ryhmä, tai tämä erityinen selviytyjä, haluaa, pyytää ja tarvitsee.<br/><br/>M: Selviytyjät puhuvat halusta saada tarinansa kuulluksi ja tunnustetuksi. Meillä on ollut kuninkaallinen komissio täällä Australiassa, joka tarjosi itsenäisen prosessin, jossa uhrit voisivat tulla esiin. Tarvitaanko jotain sellaista kirkon kansainvälisessä totuus-, oikeus- ja sovintoprosessissa?<br/><br/>H: Kyllä, luulen, että sitä tarvitaan kansainvälisesti, mutta mielestäni jokaisen paikallisen kirkon on ensin tehtävä omat kotitehtävänsä. En näe kovin pian tapahtuvan, että jokin tällainen kirkolliskokous tai komissio perustettaisiin tutkimaan tätä aluetta koko kirkkoa varten. Kirkkoon kuuluu 1,3 miljardia ihmistä, ja se on läsnä 190 maassa, ja sen psykologista, hengellistä ja taloudellista tukea koskevissa odotuksissa on kaikenlaisia eroja.<br/><br/>On yksi asia, johon olen törmännyt johdonmukaisesti kommunikoidessani, työskennellessäni ja kuunnellessani uhreja, ja se on se, että he haluavat tulla kuulluiksi. Jos siis syntyisi tunne, että uhreja kuunnellaan jatkuvasti – Roomassa ja muualla – uskon, että se olisi suuri helpotus monille uhreille.<br/><br/>Luulen, että [Paavi Franciscuksen] huolena, erityisesti kysymykseesi liittyen, on se, että paikalliset kirkot tekevät kaikkensa, jotta uhreja kuunneltaisiin kyseisessä maassa. Minulla on lista ihmisistä, jotka haluavat puhua suoraan Pyhälle Isälle, ja fyysisesti se on mahdotonta. Olin siellä vuonna 2014 kääntämässä kahdelle saksalaiselle selviytyjälle, jotka valittiin kahden irlantilaisen ja kahden englantilaisen selviytyjän kanssa, kun hän vastaanotti kuusi heistä kotona. Hän otti koko aamun kuunnellen heitä yksi toisensa jälkeen. Jokaista hän oli paikalla 40-45 minuuttia, - jos hän tekisi näin jokaiselle selviytyjälle, jota hän ei enää saanut nukuttua.<br/><br/>Hänen esimerkkinsä on mallintaminen koko katoliselle kirkolle siitä, miten uhrit ja eloonjääneet otetaan vastaan, otetaan vastaan ja kuunnellaan. Luulen, että jos piispat ja maakunnat tässä maailmassa, kaikissa maissa, seuraisivat hänen esimerkkiään, monet eloonjääneet olisivat todella kiitollisia siitä.<br/><br/>Arkkipiispa Diarmud Martinia siteerattiin juuri ennen perheiden maailmankokousta, paavillisesta komissiosta, sanoen, että se on liian pieni, koska se on tällä hetkellä perustettu saavuttamaan sen, mitä se tarvitsee saavuttaakseen. Tarvitseeko kirkon panostaa enemmän siihen, miten se valvoo näitä asioita?<br/><br/>Tällä hetkellä meillä on 16 jäsentä periaatteessa kaikista maanosista, ja merkittävistä kieliryhmistä. Edustamme erilaisia tieteenaloja ja ammatteja, ja toimikunnan – kuten juuri julkaistujen säädösten – tarkoituksena on antaa neuvoja Pyhälle Isälle.<br/><br/>Yleinen väärinkäsitys komissiosta on se, että ensin käsitellään syytöksiä, mutta näin ei ole. Meillä ei ole juridista tai hallinnollista toimivaltaa tapauksiin nähden, koska kun kyse on väärinkäytöksiä koskevista väitteistä, tuomioistuimet ja menettely on säädetty.<br/><br/>Toinen väärinkäsitys on se, että edistämme suoraan asioita paikan päällä. Ensimmäinen ja tärkein tavoitteemme on, että neuvomme Pyhää Isää kysymyksissä.<br/><br/>Joten minun näkökulmastani kyllä, meidän on investoitava enemmän. Meidän on kuitenkin investoitava enemmän paikallisella tasolla, ja meidän on varmistettava, että paavillisen komission ehdotukset välitetään Pyhälle Isälle – kuten normaalisti presidentti tekee – ja sitten on olemassa seurantaprosessi, joka heijastaa sitä, mitä olemme antaneet neuvoksemme.<br/><br/>Australiassa Catholic Professional Standards Limited valvoo kirkon vastausta ja antaa ohjeita ja tukea sen varmistamiseksi, että kaikki kirkon instituutiot ovat lapsiturvallisia instituutioita. Tarvitseeko Rooma jonkinlaista organisatorista tukea niille piispoille ja hiippakunnille, jotka kamppailevat näiden instituutioiden muodostamisessa ja turvaamisessa noissa hiippakunnissa?<br/><br/>Uskon, että lopulta komissio kehittyy tällä linjalla, ja he ovat nyt palkkaamassa näiden alojen asiantuntijoita.<br/><br/>Mielestäni kirkon on ymmärrettävä, että paikalliset kirkot voivat oppia toisiltaan vastavuoroisesti, ja ymmärrykseni on aina ollut – ja luulen, että Pyhä Isä on muistuttanut meitä – että kirkko ei tule toimimaan keskitettynä yrityksenä. Se ei toimi niin tehokkaasti. Jokaisella piispalla, jokaisella piispainkokouksella, on jossain määrin oma elämänsä. Meidän on opittava enemmän keskinäisen viestinnän kanavien avaamisesta.<br/><br/>On olemassa useita asioita, joita ihmiset syyttävät väärinkäytöksistä kirkossa: papina ja psykologina, sekä henkilönä, joka on tavannut selviytyjiä ja työskennellyt heidän kanssaan, mitä mieltä olet tästä asiasta?<br/><br/>Mielestäni kysymys siitä, mistä hyväksikäyttö tulee, on kaikkein tärkein, ja paavi on osoittanut sen 20. elokuuta julkaistussa kirjeessään Jumalan kansalle. Hän sanoo ensimmäisessä kappaleessa, ja toistaa sen yhä uudelleen, että kysymys seksuaalisesta hyväksikäytöstä liittyy aina – tai lähes aina – paitsi vallan väärinkäyttöön myös omantunnon väärinkäyttöön.<br/><br/>Todellinen peruskysymys hyväksikäytöstä on siis paljon monimutkaisempi kuin vain [kysymys] seksuaalisuudesta – oli se sitten heteroseksuaalinen tai homoseksuaalinen. Se on valtakysymys, ja siellä meidän on todella työskenneltävä sen kysymyksen parissa, miten ymmärrämme pappeuden, miten ymmärrämme piispauden, miten ymmärrämme ja elämme palvelutyömme? Mitkä ovat rajat?<br/><br/>Siksi olen iloinen, että jesuiittojen provinssi Australiassa laatii käyttäytymissääntöjä, - koska emme puhu vain alaikäisten seksuaalisesta hyväksikäytöstä. Puhumme aikuisten seksuaalisesta hyväksikäytöstä, ja puhumme hyväksikäytöstä muilla tavoin – kuten omantunnon väärinkäytöstä, jossa sanelet jollekin, mitä ajattelet, tai teeskentelet tietäväsi Jumalan kautta, ja voit kertoa toiselle henkilölle, "sinun täytyy tehdä se", vastoin tuon henkilön omaatuntoa.<br/><br/>Monien mielestä selibaatti tuottaa väärinkäytöksiä. Kuten olen aina sanonut, selibaatti sellaisenaan ei ole väärinkäytön syy – muuten miten selitämme, että 99,9 prosenttia kaikista hyväksikäyttäjistä ei elä selibaattielämää, ja miten selitämme, että 95 tai 96 prosenttia kaikista papeista ei hyväksikäytä alaikäisiä? Mutta selibaatti tai siveyslupaus, joka ei ole todella integroitunut, jota ei oikeastaan eletä kunnolla - kyllä, se tuottaa ongelman. Joskus ihmiset ottavat juomisen, joskus he ottavat pelaamisen, ja joskus he ottavat seksuaalisen väärinkäytöksen, aikuisten ja alaikäisten kanssa.<br/><br/>Todellinen kysymys tästä on, miten suhtaudumme käsitteeseen uskonnollisesta hengellisestä voimasta, johon papit ja piispat on sijoitettu? Miten teologia voi auttaa meitä ymmärtämään, ja ehkä miten sosiologia, psykologia tai liiketalous voivat auttaa meitä määrittelemään vallan rajat ja tarpeen pitää rajansa |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | En ole yllättynyt tästä epäsuhtaisuudesta, itse asiassa menisin jopa niin pitkälle, että sanoisin, että tämä ei koskaan muutu, eikä meidän pitäisi saada kaikkea höyryä sen muuttamisesta. 10 vuoden päästä meillä on vielä veristä särmää, monimutkaisia esineitä suurimpien huolenaiheiden listalla, ja asiat, joita olemme vihdoin pääsemässä ymmärtämään, ovat suurimmat osat menoistamme.<br/><br/>Nyt Gunnarilla ja Andylla on molemmilla erinomaiset pisteet, erityisesti IT-tiimien IT-ongelmien näkemisestä ja niiden ratkaisemisesta IT-ratkaisuilla; itse asiassa olen varma, että heidän pisteensä pitävät ansioita.<br/><br/>Mutta luulen, että on olemassa muita ideoita, jotka voittavat ne (kommentoin heidän blogeihinsa siitä, ja myöhemmin päätin, että minun pitäisi vain blogata täällä).<br/><br/>Pelkäämme uusia asioita, koska emme ymmärrä niitä, tai emme ymmärrä niitä, koska ne ovat uusia.<br/><br/>Ne ovat liian uusia, jotta meillä olisi pitäviä lähestymistapoja niiden käsittelyyn.<br/><br/>ne ovat liian uusia meille tietää, jos meidän pitäisi olla huolissaan vai ei! meillä on taipumus oletuksena vainoharhainen / huolissaan, mikä on hyvä!<br/><br/>liian uusia, jotta niille olisi määritetty ilmeisiä budjettikohteita. Voinko ostaa laatikon tai jonkin ohjelmiston, joka tarjoaa "pilviturvallisuuden" tai "sosiaalisen median turvallisuuden"?<br/><br/>Ne ovat niin uusia, että yritys ei edes osaa käyttää niitä tai mitä ne haluavat niistä. Puhumattakaan siitä, miten voimme turvata ne samalla, kun täytämme tai emme ainakaan tallaa kaikkia liiketoiminnan tarpeita. Jos yritys ei vielä edes osaa käyttää niitä, en ole varma, onko tietoturvassa mitään mahdollisuuksia ohjata kyseistä käyttöä turvallisesti.<br/><br/>On myös mainittava, että näitä uusia asioita työnnetään pitkälti kuluttajamaan kautta liiketoimintaan, IT:n ollessa eräänlainen, "Oh yeah", ajatus. Palomuurit, AV, AM, Auth ovat kaikki IT-vastauksia tyypillisesti IT-kysymyksiin. Ne ovat myös hyvin subjektiivisia asioita, toisin kuin hyvin objektiiviset kohteet, kuten palomuurit, tunnetut haitalliset bitit, käyttäytymiset, allekirjoitukset, portit. Liiketoiminta esittää hyvin monimutkaisia asioita, joihin liittyy usein ihmisiä (joita emme voi paikata) ja jotka eivät usein sovi hienosti yleissääntöihin. Vaikka kääntyisimme pois teknisistä ratkaisuista ja omistaisimme aikamme näiden ongelmien ratkaisemiseen, niitä ei silti ratkaista siististi. Samoin kun push tulee työntämään, voiko sinulla olla ja täyttää tavoitteet palomuureilla? Voitko osoittaa parannusta? Kaikki tämä juontaa juurensa näiden asioiden melko subjektiivisesta, ei-teknisestä näkökohdasta, tavallaan erosta lapsen todistuksen ja vanhempien ja opettajien konferenssista saaman palautteen välillä. Jos sinulla on lapsi, kumman kanssa olisit taipuvaisin olemaan eri mieltä tai et välttämättä uskoisi? (Vastaus on subjektiivinen!)<br/><br/>Voitaisiin sanoa, että tämä on turvallisuuden ja teknologian luonnollista etenemistä: teknisten kontrollien tyrehdyttämisestä pinon ylöspäin siirtymiseen kohti käyttäytymistä ja ihmisiä. Toki näiden 3 suurimman huolenaiheen voidaan sanoa lävistävän palomuurit ja verkkosegmentit, mutta se on näiden asioiden luonne (sosiaalinen media "lävistys" palomuurin läpi on aivan erilainen kuin minä lävistys SSH-yhteyden kautta kotiverkkoni sillaksi; sosiaalinen media on samanlainen kuin * tapa * Käytän SSH-yhteyttäni sen jälkeen, kun ruumaa on jo lyöty, koska sitä tarvitaan; so. sosiaalinen media on tapa, jolla porttia 80 käytetään).<br/><br/>Periaatteessa kaikki merkit viittaavat siihen, ettei tämä kahtiajako yllätä, enkä usko tämän olevan lisätodiste siitä, että IT/turvallisuus tekee sen väärin, tai että se ei ole oikein linjassa liiketoiminnan kanssa, tai että sillä on tekninen tumma palvelinhuoneen tausta. En sano, että teemme asiat oikein tai olemme oikein linjassa, mutta edellä mainittu ei ole hyvä argumentti tukemaan teoriaa näistä puutteista.<br/><br/>Nyt todella iso hyppy. Haluaisin, että nykyinen mobiililaskennan lisäys olisi yhtä suuri kuin tietokoneiden käyttöönotto liiketoiminnassa ja myöhemmin PC / internet liiketoiminnassa. En ollut paikalla, kun edellinen tapahtui, enkä ollut alalla, kun henkilökohtainen tietokonevallankumous siirtyi liiketoimintaan, mutta veikkaisin, että se on lähin vertailu tähän mennessä. Nämä ovat kirotun uusia ja ne ovat suuria muutoksia, jotka ylittävät vain Macien tai uusien ohjelmistojen tai jonkin uuden liiketoimintaprosessin tuomisen. |
