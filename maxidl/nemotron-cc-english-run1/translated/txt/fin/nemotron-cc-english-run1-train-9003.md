| The Masterpiece: a Chain Poetry Challenge<br/><br/>John has been writing poetry since his school days. He was awarded the "Best Poet 2014 and 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet in a Japanese kimono, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>A Brief History of Collaborative, Collective, or Chain Poetry<br/><br/>Collaborative,collective, or chain poetry is an alternative and creative technique for writing poetry by more than one person. The principal aim of this type of poetry is to create poems through the collaboration of various authors/poets, trying to form a unified voice while still maintain their individual voices.<br/><br/>Examples of collaboration abound in Japanese poetry. Though the precise accounts and records of many such events are either lost or missing.<br/><br/>One of the most famous examples of collective poetry writing was the poem collection titled Ralentir Travaux by Surrealist French poets André Breton, Paul Éluard and René Char. These three poets collaborated to write the poems in this collection over just five days in 1930.<br/><br/>During the 1940s, Charles Henri Ford, an American poet, invented what he called the "chain poem", where each poet wrote a line and then sent the poem to another person (to continue) in another part of the world, by post.<br/><br/>In 2007 a collection of American collaborative poetry Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry was edited and published by Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton and David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Collaborative poetry writing has been used in schools and colleges to teach students teamwork and to discover ways in which they are connected.(source: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>Study of a Figure Outdoors: Woman with a Parasol, facing left, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain or Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Aim of This Article and How to Approach the Challenge<br/><br/>A few years back I wrote an article called "Poem Without an End" which included a Christmas poem I had written that lent itself to being added to. I was amazed by the response as at that stage I only had a few followers here. People wrote a stanza of poetry each in "comments" on the hub to follow on from the previous commenter's stanza. It worked out very well and at the end I compiled all the contributions into a single poem as part of the hub.<br/><br/>Similar challenges have been issued since, including one by Frank Atanacio called "Spirits Sat as Mourners" that was also very successful. The difference being that in that instance contributors wrote their own hubs for their stanza of poetry and placed a link on Frank's original hub.<br/><br/>For this particular challenge I don't expect everyone to spend valuable time writing separate hubs for one stanza of poetry (unless you really want to). The main problem being that to make it effective you would have to copy the previously written parts of the poem onto your hub and would probably be hit with "duplication" label.<br/><br/>So, that being the case, and also to save having to leave links everywhere, I just ask that anyone who wants to take part just write their stanza here in "comments." Check the last comment before yours that is contributing to the challenge and follow on. If I see more than one following from the same stanza I will use my poetic licence to work them in as I deem best.<br/><br/>At some stage when I feel there has been enough stanzas added I will probably call an end to the challenge and then compile them all together as the completed poem as part of the article (also giving credit to each contributor).<br/><br/>Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Challenge!<br/><br/>Now comes the interesting part. If you join this chain poetry challenge you have to try to keep the style and voice of the poem as close as possible to the preceding verses, so that to uninformed readers it will appear that only one author has written the entire poem.<br/><br/>Sounds easy, you say? Well maybe it would be if the poem had a traditional style, rhyme or meter. But this one doesn't! The poem you will be adding to was started by an acquaintance of mine Andriealphus as a "chain poem challenge" elsewhere. At the time of writing I was the only other person who had accepted the challenge, and because I loved the subject I thought it would be a great challenge for my fellow writers and decided to use it here and see if the response would be better. (I know of a few poets here whose writing would suit this style)<br/><br/>Rules :<br/><br/>Follow on from the previous stanza in comments<br/><br/>Try to retain the voice and style of the poem<br/><br/>Keep your stanza/verse to approximately the same length as those before<br/><br/>Claude Monet was one of the most famous painters in the history of art and a leading figure in the Impressionist movement.<br/><br/>In 1883 Monet moved to Giverny. Here, he loved to paint outdoors in the gardens that he helped create. The water lilies found in the pond had a particular appeal, and he painted several series of them throughout the rest of his life; the Japanese-style bridge over the pond became the subject of several works, as well.<br/><br/>In 1912 Monet painted a series of 12 waterlily paintings commissioned by the Orangerie des Tuileries, a museum in Paris. He chose to make them on a very large scale, and to serve as a "haven of peaceful meditation." This project consumed much of Monet's later years. Monet once stated, "These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me. It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel."<br/><br/>His health was now an obstacle, as well. Nearly blind, with both of his eyes seriously affected by cataracts, Monet finally agreed to undergo surgery for the ailment in 1923.<br/><br/>Monet's famous water lilies turned redder as his cataracts progressed. After getting corrective surgery he destroyed most of the "red lily" paintings, angry that no one really mentioned it to him. Ironically, these paintings were probably what made his impressionistic style so famous in that time -- artists started taking more risks with color and such during this point. (source: biography.com)<br/><br/>The Masterpiece<br/><br/>"The boy sitting behind you says you look like a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ask him, has he ever seen a Monet up close?<br/><br/>Close enough to see nothing but muddled strokes of weedy lakeshore?<br/><br/>Close enough to dip his fingers into the ridges<br/><br/>where oil paints hardened under an artist's gaze?<br/><br/>Close enough to breathe onto the blood lilies?<br/><br/>Ask him, why did he paint them red?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>He grinned like Carroll's cheshire cat.<br/><br/>"Through clouded and bloodshot eyes I imagine.<br/><br/>Be my waterlilies!" he says,<br/><br/>"Feel my breath and let my fingers delve,<br/><br/>become my masterpiece instead.<br/><br/>A brush has never touched a canvas as fine as your fair skin.<br/><br/>Let the masters weep in jealousy,<br/><br/>and Van Gogh slice his ear in envy at the beauty of your nakedness."(Jodah)<br/><br/>Self portrait with bandaged ear<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Responses<br/><br/>Now it's your turn. Please write your response in the comments below, remembering to check those immediately before yours for the last written stanza of the poem. If you do decide to write a separate hub for your stanza of verse, make sure you leave a link here in comments.<br/><br/>The Finished Masterpiece<br/><br/>All contributions have been received and I have put the finished poem together with only some slight edits. I hope everyone is happy with the result. If you think I could improve the order of stanzas etc, feel free to let me know.<br/><br/>Comments<br/><br/>Hey Diana, looks like I have to go add another stanza to the finished poem :)<br/><br/>Thanks for this contribution.Quite beautiful.<br/><br/>Diana L Pierce from Potter County, Pa. on September 19, 2015:<br/><br/>No tears splash water below,<br/><br/>From the bridge beneath his feet,<br/><br/>Nor can his brush paint his thoughts,<br/><br/>From the mystery maid he seeks.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 21, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Cris, I am sure everyone appreciates your comment.

And the beauty we can still enjoy today from all his work.<br/><br/>This is a great challenge! I am really looking forward to adding to this.<br/><br/>I first wanted to stop in and let you know that, up for sure. Shared too.<br/><br/>And thank you so much for all the challenges to help the rest of us, keep our mental energy flowing and giving it a work out! You are the best.<br/><br/>The information about LuLu and the free ISBN number is an answered prayer! So, smile my friend. You are a gift!<br/><br/>Hugs. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Marj. I think I may have all the verses that are going to come. I have been doing my best to arrange them as I think best with just a little editing. I will probably post the finished poem as a separate hub with a link on this one to it. My book is available on Lulu and iBooks...there's a link on one of the earlier comments. I'd really appreciate it if you were to purhase a copy. Bear in mind it's my first eBook so the formatting etc isn't perfect, but it's taken me seven revisions I think to get it where it is. It will all be easier next time. If you need help let me know.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John, you have certainly had some excellent responses to your challenge - I'm sure you'll fuse it altogether beautifully although I imagine a difficult task. I'm interested in your poetry books also - I really have to get my act together technologically - I'll try and check it all out...cheers -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, both books 'On the Wings of Eagles" and "I Laughed a Smile" have mostly the same content...except the former has one extra poem. Originally they were in different formats, one ePub, the other PDF but now they are both ePub. They are available through Lulu and iBooks, soon Barnes and Noble and Nook (not Amazon). I may try publishing another book through Amazon soon just to see how it compares. Thanks again.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thanks a lot, the info on publishing with Lulu will be quite useful as I'm thinking of publishing but I'm currently torn between Amazon and Lulu. I wanted to purchase one of your books, but I couldn't seem to find them on Amazon. However, I'll probably get it from Lulu. Wishing you every success, you deserve it.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hey Phyllis, thanks for ontributing. I like it, a perfect ending to the poem I think.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, I think I have sorted out the poem satisfactorily. Just waiting to see if there is any more to add. Publishing with Lulu wasn't bad and now that I've done it once it will be easier next time. Getting the formatting to look right in the eBook was the hardest, though you and just type it in a word document and Lulu automatically produces the contents page and converts the document to ePub or PDF you can only use certain fonts and have to make sure the chapter names or poem titles are in Heading 1. They also provide a free ISBN number if you want. Overall it was easier than expected however.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, this is succinct and beautiful, I love it. Shyron's did an excellent job also, I thought I'd already commented on her verse, but I hadn't.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns from High desert of Nevada. on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Wonderful hub, great idea, Jodah. Here is one from me. Short but sweet.

You are kind. Jo, you have always been a brilliant poet. I, too, am looking forward to the end result after John does his magic to pull it all together.<br/><br/>I will share again to see if there are any more takers.<br/><br/>Blessings<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Faith, beautifully done, I find it incredible how someone with such limited vision can teach us so much about beauty, light and shadows. John, looking forward to reading the end result.<br/><br/>By the way, congtats on publishing your poems. How did you find the process of publishing with Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for your great submission Faith. No it's not too late, I'm still compiling the final poem so it should be up for all to see in a day or two.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John,<br/><br/>I apologize for my late submission here to your wonderful challenge. I am off from work a couple of day and decided to give this a go while my husband is resting from knee surgery. If it does not meet with your standards, please feel free to not use it in your final poem or edit as you deem necessary.<br/><br/>Blessings always<br/><br/>Here it goes:<br/><br/>Confessions to friend Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>Of light encapsulating both torment, joy<br/><br/>Fervent madness in analyzing colors<br/><br/>Consequential spontaneous creations<br/><br/>Season after season of obsession<br/><br/>Capturing different hues in a single moment<br/><br/>Attentive while strolling in Argenteuill<br/><br/>Brushwork bares masterpiece.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 09, 2015:<br/><br/>Just a shout out to see if anyone else still wants to contribute to this chain poem.

Thanks to all who have contributed.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Genna. It appears Monet is a favourite arist of many here. I hope you'll take part in this challenge too :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you for a great contribution Shyron. This is a very nice verse. Well done.<br/><br/>Genna East from Massachusetts, USA on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John...<br/><br/>I started to read this wonderful challenge (Monet is one of my favorite artists), then came back to finish reading some of the beautiful contributions that give this painting a stunning voice through perception and the senses.

I'm so glad you like my contribution. This is a very good idea, I know you'll have fun putting it all together. Take care and my best to you.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Deb, yes I am impressed by the standard of submissions. I'm looking forward to putting it all together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Ann, it is good to see the poets among us take up the challenge with some great contributions so far. I just hope Imcan do it justice when it comes to putting it together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Well done Jo. The word "sublime" comes to mind. I hoped all the poets would rise to the fore, and they have. Love it, thanks for contributing.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt from Stillwater, OK on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>I am excited to see what you end up with here. There are a number of fine poets rising to the challenge, so go to it!<br/><br/>Ann Carr from SW England on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Great one, Jo!<br/><br/>You've got everyone going, John! Rather you than me, putting all this together, but it's going to be a humdinger of a poem when it finally comes to an end - if it ever does! You've really started something.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John here goes nothing! Following from Kim's. I hope it reads well.<br/><br/>And the boy began to walk away<br/><br/>But in his wake, I heard him say<br/><br/>"I took a trip to Orangerie<br/><br/>Where the ghost of Monet still abides<br/><br/>I sat right down and gazed awhile<br/><br/>Until I heard a soft voice cry.<br/><br/>"Have you ever seen a fluid dream?<br/><br/>Where light evolves into what it touch<br/><br/>Where serenity flows through cloudy veil<br/><br/>Where the magician's brush like lightening rush<br/><br/>Have you ever seen a sight sublime?<br/><br/>A child born of distorted illusion<br/><br/>This flowering pond that traps the light<br/><br/>That lift the heart and beckons the soul<br/><br/>An abstract pulchritude up close<br/><br/>Move back, behold; such tranquil delight."<br/><br/>I hope this is in line with what the others have done. Feel free to edit if needed.

Anyone is welcome to do more than one stanza. I may add another myself at some stage.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>John, I've decided to have a go, but it's about 16 lines, can I do it in two stanzas following on from Kim's wonderful submission? You can always edit it later.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, sorry to hear you are under the weather at the moment. I am not in a hurry to close this challenge so I'll keep it open until you are back firing on all cylinders and are able to contribute. You are one of the hubbers I was looking forward to getting a response from as I thought it would suit. Thank you for your kind words, and get well soon.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John I can't believe I almost missed your incredible challenged. This is something in which I would have loved to participate since Claude Monet is one of my all times favourite artist. Unfortunately, I must cry off. I'm a bit under the weather with a head full of cotton wool, or so it seems. If the challenge is still open when I get rid of this pesky flu I may give it a go, but I must say, the standard is exceptionally high. Maj took it to another level but all the submissions are brilliant. Kudos to you Andriealphus and the other writers who participated so far in this artistic and creative masterpiece.<br/><br/>My best always Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Maj, glad this poem inspired you, and yes it beats watching the cricket especially with the Aussie batsmen performing badly in this third test. It will be an interesting exercise for me to fuse all the stanzas together but should be good.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thank you, I'm most happy you like my offering. I found the poem intriguing and suddenly felt inspired to write my version in the same mode. I'm not sure I wrote a continuation from the stanza before (alwaysexploring) but I'm sure you will fuse it altogether when the time comes. Love all the responses. I haven't managed any creative writing for yonks, can't wait now to start over, just need some time. (beats watching the cricket too!!!) Cheers John, will be checking in -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for checking Dana. I am pleased with the quality of responses so far. I just have to wait and see how many more come in. The final,poem should be great.<br/><br/>Dana Tate from LOS ANGELES on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Just checking in to see how things are going, I can't wait for the finished product.

Tämäntyyppisen runouden päätavoitteena on luoda runoja eri kirjoittajien/runoilijoiden yhteistyönä, yrittäen muodostaa yhtenäisen äänen säilyttäen samalla yksilöllisen äänensä.<br/><br/>Esimerkkejä yhteistyöstä on runsaasti japanilaisessa runoudessa, vaikka monien tällaisten tapahtumien tarkat kertomukset ja tallenteet ovat joko kadonneet tai puuttuvat.<br/><br/>Tunnetuimpia esimerkkejä kollektiivisesta runonkirjoituksesta oli surrealististen ranskalaisrunoilijoiden André Bretonin, Paul Aluardin ja René Charin runokokoelma Ralentir Travaux. Nämä kolme runoilijaa kirjoittivat yhdessä runoja tähän kokoelmaan vain viiden päivän aikana vuonna 1930.<br/><br/>1940-luvun aikana amerikkalainen runoilija Charles Henri Ford keksi "ketjurunoksi" kutsumansa runon, jossa jokainen runoilija kirjoitti rivin ja lähetti sitten runon toiselle henkilölle (jatkettavaksi) toiseen maailmankolkkaan, postitse.<br/><br/>Vuonna 2007 ilmestyi kokoelma amerikkalaista yhteisrunoutta Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry, jonka editoivat ja julkaisivat Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton ja David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Yhteistoiminnallista runojen kirjoittamista on käytetty kouluissa ja korkeakouluissa opettamaan opiskelijoille tiimityötä ja löytämään tapoja, joilla he ovat yhteydessä toisiinsa.(lähde: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>Tutkimus hahmosta ulkona: nainen, jolla on päivänvarjo, vasemmalla, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public Domain tai Public Domain], via Wikimedia Commonsissa<br/><br/>Tämän artikkelin tarkoitus ja kuinka lähestyä haastetta<br/><br/>Muutama vuosi sitten kirjoitin "Poem Without an End" -nimisen artikkelin, joka sisälsi kirjoittamani joulurunon, joka lainasi itsensä lisäykseen. Olin hämmästynyt vastauksesta, sillä siinä vaiheessa minulla oli vain muutama seuraaja täällä. Ihmiset kirjoittivat runosäkeistön kukin "kommentteihin" napaan jatkoksi edellisen kommentaattorin säkeistöstä. Se toimi erittäin hyvin ja lopussa kokosin kaikki osuudet yhdeksi runoksi osaksi napaa.<br/><br/>Vastaavia haasteita on sittemmin julkaistu, muun muassa Frank Atanacion kirjoittama "Spirits Sat as Mourners", joka myös menestyi hyvin. Erona on, että siinä tapauksessa avustajat kirjoittivat omat keskuksensa runosäkeilleen ja asettivat linkin Frankin alkuperäiseen keskukseen.<br/><br/>Tätä erityistä haastetta varten en odota kaikkien käyttävän arvokasta aikaa erillisten hubien kirjoittamiseen yhdelle runosäkeistölle (ellei todella halua). Suurin ongelma on se, että jotta se olisi tehokas, sinun olisi kopioitava runon aiemmin kirjoitetut osat napaasi ja luultavasti osuma "kaksoiskappale" -merkillä.<br/><br/>Niin, että asia, ja myös säästää tarvitse jättää linkkejä kaikkialle, pyydän vain, että jokainen, joka haluaa osallistua vain kirjoittaa säkeistönsä täällä "kommentteihin." Tarkista viimeinen kommentti ennen omaasi, joka osallistuu haasteeseen ja seuraa. Jos näen useamman kuin yhden seuraavan samasta säkeistöstä, käytän runollista lupaani työstääkseni niitä parhaaksi katsomallani tavalla.<br/><br/>Jossain vaiheessa, kun tunnen, että on lisätty tarpeeksi säkeitä, kutsun todennäköisesti haasteen loppua ja kokoan ne kaikki yhteen valmiiksi runoksi osana artikkelia (antaen myös kunnian jokaiselle rahoittajalle).<br/><br/>Kukkainen Jokiranta, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commonsissa<br/><br/>Haaste!<br/><br/>Nyt tulee mielenkiintoinen osuus. Jos liityt tähän ketjun runohaasteeseen, sinun täytyy yrittää pitää runon tyyli ja ääni mahdollisimman lähellä edellisiä säkeitä, niin että tietämättömille lukijoille näyttää siltä, että vain yksi kirjoittaja on kirjoittanut koko runon.<br/><br/>Kuulostaa helpolta, sanot? No ehkä olisi, jos runossa olisi perinteinen tyyli, riimi tai mittari. Mutta tämä ei! Runon, johon lisäät, aloitti Andriealphus-tuttuni "ketjurunon haasteena" muualla. Kirjoitushetkellä olin ainoa toinen henkilö, joka oli ottanut haasteen vastaan, ja koska rakastin aihetta, ajattelin, että se olisi suuri haaste kanssakirjailijoilleni ja päätin käyttää sitä täällä ja katsoa, olisiko vastaus parempi. (Tiedän muutamia runoilijoita, joiden kirjoitus sopisi tähän tyyliin)<br/><br/>Säännöt :<br/><br/>Seuraa edellistä säkeistöä kommenteissa<br/><br/>Yritä säilyttää runon ääni ja tyyli<br/><br/>Pidä säkeistösi/käännöksesi suunnilleen samanpituisena kuin ennen<br/><br/>Claude Monet oli yksi taidehistorian kuuluisimmista maalareista ja impressionistisen liikkeen johtohahmo.<br/><br/>Vuonna 1883 Monet muutti Givernyyn, jossa hän maalasi mielellään ulkona puutarhoissa, joita hän auttoi luomaan. Lammesta löydetyillä vesililjoilla oli erityinen vetovoima, ja hän maalasi niitä useita sarjoja koko loppuelämänsä ajan; myös lammen ylittävä japanilaistyylinen silta joutui useiden teosten kohteeksi.<br/><br/>Vuonna 1912 Monet maalasi Pariisin Orangerie des Tuileries -museon tilaaman 12 waterlily-maalauksen sarjan, jonka hän päätti tehdä hyvin laajassa mittakaavassa ja toimia "rauhallisen meditaation tyyssijana". Tämä projekti kulutti suuren osan Monet'n myöhemmistä vuosista. Monet totesi kerran: "Näistä veden ja heijastuksen maisemista on tullut minulle pakkomielle. Se on yli minun voimani vanhana miehenä, ja silti haluan tehdä sen, mitä tunnen."<br/><br/>Hänen terveytensä oli nyt myös esteenä. Lähes sokeana, molemmat silmänsä vakavasti harmaakaihista kärsineenä Monet suostui lopulta leikkaukseen sairauden vuoksi vuonna 1923.<br/><br/>Monet'n kuuluisat vesililjat muuttuivat punaisemmiksi hänen kaihiensa edetessä. Saatuaan korjausleikkauksen hän tuhosi suurimman osan "punaliljan" maalauksista suuttuneena siitä, ettei kukaan oikeastaan maininnut sitä hänelle. Ironista kyllä, nämä maalaukset olivat luultavasti se, mikä teki hänen impressionistisesta tyylistään niin kuuluisan tuona aikana - taiteilijat alkoivat ottaa enemmän riskejä värien ja sellaisten kanssa tässä vaiheessa.

Olen tehnyt parhaani järjestääkseni ne mielestäni parhaiten vain pienellä muokkauksella. Luultavasti lähetän valmiin runon erillisenä napana, jossa on linkki tähän. Kirjani on saatavilla Lulussa ja iBooksissa...siellä on linkki yhteen aikaisemmista kommenteista. Olisin todella kiitollinen, jos ostaisit kopion. Muista, että se on ensimmäinen e-kirjani, joten muotoilu jne. ei ole täydellinen, mutta se on vienyt minulta seitsemän tarkistusta mielestäni, jotta se saadaan sinne, missä se on. Se on helpompaa seuraavalla kerralla.

Alun perin ne olivat eri muodoissa, yksi ePub, toinen PDF mutta nyt ne ovat molemmat ePub. Ne ovat saatavilla Lulun ja iBooksin kautta, pian Barnes ja Noble ja Nook (ei Amazon). Voin yrittää julkaista toisen kirjan Amazonin kautta pian vain nähdä, miten se vertaa. Kiitos jälleen.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues Lincolnshirestä, Iso-Britanniasta 11. elokuuta 2015:<br/><br/>John, kiitos paljon, Lulun kanssa julkaisemisen tiedot ovat varsin hyödyllisiä, koska ajattelen julkaisemista, mutta olen tällä hetkellä Amazonin ja Lulun välissä.

Vain odottaa, onko lisättävää. Julkaiseminen Lulun kanssa ei ollut huono ja nyt, kun olen tehnyt sen kerran, se on helpompaa ensi kerralla. Muotoilun saaminen näyttämään oikealta e-kirjassa oli vaikeinta, vaikka sinä ja vain kirjoitat sen sana-asiakirjaan ja Lulu tuottaa automaattisesti sisältösivun ja muuntaa asiakirjan ePub- tai PDF-muotoon, voit käyttää vain tiettyjä fontteja ja sinun on varmistettava, että luvun nimet tai runon otsikot ovat otsakkeessa 1. Ne tarjoavat myös ilmaisen ISBN-numeron, jos haluat.

Minulla ei ole kiire sulkea tätä haastetta, joten pidän sen auki, kunnes olet takaisin ampumassa kaikkia sylintereitä ja pystyt osallistumaan.

John En voi uskoa, että melkein missasin uskomattoman haasteesi. Tämä on jotain, johon olisin halunnut osallistua, koska Claude Monet on yksi kaikkien aikojen suosikkiartisteistani. Valitettavasti minun täytyy itkeä pois. Olen hieman sään alla pää täynnä pumpulia, tai siltä näyttää. Jos haaste on vielä auki, kun pääsen eroon tästä ärsyttävästä flunssasta, voin antaa sille mahdollisuuden, mutta minun on sanottava, että standardi on poikkeuksellisen korkea. Maj vei sen toiselle tasolle, mutta kaikki esitykset ovat loistavia.

Löysin runon kiehtovana ja tunsin yhtäkkiä innoitusta kirjoittaa versioni samassa tilassa. En ole varma kirjoitin jatkoa säkeistö ennen (aina exploring), mutta olen varma, että sulatat sen kokonaan, kun aika tulee. Rakasta kaikkia vastauksia. En ole onnistunut mitään luovaa kirjoittamista yonks, en voi odottaa nyt aloittaa alusta, vain tarvitsevat jonkin aikaa. (lyöntiä katsomassa kriketti liian!!!)

| First of all EEQT itself needs to be further developed in order to provide a theoretical and computational answer to the needs of modern quantum engineering<br/>and technology. We need to include classical systems with infinite<br/>numbers of degrees of freedom - like electromagnetic and/or gravitational<br/>field. We also need to include infinite quantum systems so as<br/>to understand and simulate Bose gas and its phase transitions. But, there<br/>are also steps that must be taken far beyond the paradigm of EEQT.<br/>As we have emphasized so many times: quantum theory has yet<br/>to be understood in terms of a "non-linear classical theory." But what we mean by a "classical theory" is something much more advanced and more<br/>general than clasical mechanics or classical field theory. By a "classical theory" we mean first of all, a theory that is not based<br/>on probabilities from the start; a theory in which probabilities appear at a<br/>later stage, derived from the theory; derived perhaps, in a necessary way. Such a theory must not only specify the mathematical objects and their relations but also make "predictions".<br/>A classical theory is, in particular, a theory in which discrete events can happen, events that are "objective." They may be events that affect mainly the physical stratum, but they may be also "mental<br/>events," changes of states of "consciousness;" whatever they are, even if they<br/>are concerned with branchings of universes, - they DO HAPPEN.<br/>Such a theory, encompassing the quantum theory as we know it today,<br/>does not yet exist, but we can envisage its possible shape. Nothing serves better than an example, so let us give here an example of how<br/>such a theory can be construed.<br/>Imagine a theory developed a'la Einstein's unified field theory, but<br/>with variable metric signature, possibly with a complex causal web, multiple<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (see also [41]) bridges,<br/>time loops, nondifferrentiability, fractal structure, all of that additionally complicated by variable dimensionality of space and of "time" (cf [42]. Imagine such a theory to be able to accomodate all the four fundamental<br/>forces known to us, but it also involves an extra field, which is different<br/>from physical fields, and which is non-local in the sense that it does not<br/>survive taking a macro-average-limit when causal space-time<br/>structure of Einstein's general relativity is recovered. This extra field<br/>would be a place for "thought forms" and our theory would couple these<br/>thought forms to more "physical" levels of reality. The very concept of<br/>"time" would arise only in one particular limiting structure. Nothing<br/>prevents a theory of such a type to have mathematical structures rich enough to accomodate consciousness and mind. Due to its complexity,<br/>density of time-loops, bubble-like causal structure, making predictions<br/>in such theory is possible only by applying probability -<br/>as it is the case with systems evolving according to deterministic<br/>but chaotic dynamics. Quantum wave function would emerge in such a<br/>theory as an effective way of predicting. That type of explanation<br/>of quantum indeterminism was postulated long ago by I. J. Good. In<br/>[3] he speculated that<br/>quantum indeterminism can be understood if we admit that individual quantum events that actually happen here and now have future<br/>advanced causes as well has past retarded causes.<br/>A glimpse of such a thought<br/>may have occured to Alan Turing when he wrote his famous, already quoted sentence: "prediction must be linear, description must be nonlinear."<br/>A theory going partially in this direction is being developed by L. Nottale<br/>[43] who states the observation, attributed to Feynman, that "the typical paths of quantum mechanical particles are continuous non-differentiable." Then he continues his development of fractal<br/>space-time ideas to conclude with: "The quantum behavior becomes, in this theory,<br/>a manifestation of the fractal geometry of space-time, in the same way gravitation is, in Einstein's theory of general (motion-)relativity, a manifestation of the curvature of space-time.<br/>Another step in this direction comes from the work of Russian scientists - which started with the most original ideas of N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>and A. Sakharov [45], and is being developed in Moscow, the Urals and Siberia, see e.g. [46, 47, 48]. | Ensinnäkin EEQT:tä itsessään on kehitettävä edelleen, jotta voidaan tarjota teoreettinen ja laskennallinen vastaus nykyaikaisen kvanttitekniikan ja -teknologian tarpeisiin. Meidän on sisällytettävä klassiset järjestelmät, joissa on ääretön määrä vapausasteita - kuten sähkömagneettista ja / tai gravitaatiokenttää. Meidän on myös sisällytettävä äärettömät kvanttijärjestelmät, jotta voimme ymmärtää ja simuloida Bose-kaasua ja sen vaihesiirtymiä. Mutta on myös askelia, jotka on otettava paljon pidemmälle kuin EEQT:n paradigma.<br/>Kuten olemme korostaneet niin monta kertaa: kvanttiteoriaa ei ole vielä ymmärretty "ei-lineaarisen klassisen teorian" termein. Mutta se, mitä tarkoitamme "klassisella teorialla", on jotain paljon kehittyneempää ja yleisempää kuin klassinen mekaniikka tai klassinen kenttäteoria. "Klassisella teorialla" tarkoitetaan ennen kaikkea teoriaa, joka ei perustu alusta alkaen todennäköisyyksiin; teoriaa, jossa todennäköisyydet ilmenevät myöhemmässä vaiheessa, johdettuna teoriasta; johdettuna ehkä, välttämättömällä tavalla. Tällaisen teorian täytyy paitsi määritellä matemaattiset objektit ja niiden suhteet, myös tehdä "ennustuksia".<br/>Klassinen teoria on erityisesti teoria, jossa diskreettejä tapahtumia voi tapahtua, tapahtumia, jotka ovat "objektiivisia". Ne voivat olla tapahtumia, jotka vaikuttavat pääasiassa fyysiseen kerrostumaan, mutta ne voivat olla myös "henkisiä tapahtumia", "tietoisuuden" tilojen muutoksia; mitä ne sitten ovatkin, vaikka ne koskisivatkin universumien haaroittumista - ne TAPAHTUU.<br/>Tällaista teoriaa, joka kattaa kvanttiteorian sellaisena kuin sen nykyään tunnemme, ei ole vielä olemassa, mutta voimme kuvitella sen mahdollisen muodon. Mikään ei palvele paremmin kuin esimerkki, joten antakaamme tässä esimerkki siitä, miten tällainen teoria voidaan tulkita.<br/>Kuvittele teorian kehittäneen a'la Einsteinin yhtenäisen kenttäteorian, mutta vaihtelevalla metrisellä allekirjoituksella, mahdollisesti monimutkaisella kausaaliverkolla, useita<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (ks. myös [41]) sillat, aikasilmukat, ei-differentiaalisuus, fraktaalirakenne, kaikki sitä lisäksi monimutkaistaa avaruuden ja "ajan" vaihteleva ulottuvuus (vrt. [42]. Kuvitellaan, että tällainen teoria kykenisi majoittamaan kaikki tuntemamme neljä perusvoimaa, mutta siihen liittyy myös ylimääräinen kenttä, joka on erilainen kuin fyysiset kentät ja joka on ei-paikallinen siinä mielessä, että se ei selviä makrokeskimääräisen rajan ottamisesta, kun Einsteinin yleisen suhteellisuusteorian kausaalinen aika-avaruusrakenne saadaan takaisin. Tämä ylimääräinen kenttä olisi paikka "ajatusmuodoille" ja teoriamme yhdistäisi nämä ajatusmuodot todellisuuden "fyysisemmille" tasoille.<br/>"Aika" syntyisi vain yhdessä tietyssä rajoittavassa rakenteessa. Mikään ei estä tällaisen teorian matemaattisia rakenteita, jotka ovat riittävän rikkaita mukautumaan tietoisuuteen ja mieleen. Monimutkaisuutensa vuoksi aikasilmukoiden tiheys, kuplamainen kausaalinen rakenne, ennusteiden tekeminen tällaisessa teoriassa on mahdollista vain soveltamalla todennäköisyyttä -<br/>kuten on laita järjestelmien kehittyessä deterministisen mutta kaoottisen dynamiikan mukaan. Kvanttiaaltofunktio syntyisi tällaisessa teoriassa tehokkaana tapana ennustaa. Tämän tyyppisen selityksen kvantti-indeterminismille esitti kauan sitten I. J. Good. In<br/>[3] hän spekuloi, että kvantti-indeterminismi voidaan ymmärtää, jos myönnämme, että yksittäisillä kvanttitapahtumilla, jotka todella tapahtuvat täällä ja nyt, on myös tulevia kehittyneitä syitä.<br/>Väläys tällaisesta ajatuksesta on saattanut sattua Alan Turingille, kun hän kirjoitti kuuluisan, jo lainatun lauseensa: "Ennakoinnin täytyy olla lineaarista, kuvauksen epälineaarista."<br/>Teoriaa, joka menee osittain tähän suuntaan, kehittää L. Nottale.<br/>[43] joka toteaa Feynmanin esittämän havainnon, että "kvanttimekaanisten hiukkasten tyypilliset polut ovat jatkuvia ei-differentiaalisia." Sitten hän jatkaa fraktaaliavaruus-aika-ajatusten kehittämistään päätellen: "Kvanttikäyttäytymisestä tulee tässä teoriassa aika-avaruuden fraktaaligeometrian ilmentymä, samalla tavalla gravitaatio on Einsteinin yleisen (liike-)suhteellisuuden teoriassa aika-avaruuden kaarevuuden ilmentymä.<br/>Toinen askel tähän suuntaan tulee venäläisten tiedemiesten työstä - joka alkoi N. A. Kozyrevin omaperäisimmistä ideoista [44].<br/>ja A. Saharov [45], ja sitä kehitetään Moskovassa, Uralilla ja Siperiassa, ks. esim. [46, 47, 48]. |
| Best Nutrition And Exercise For Lose Weight<br/><br/>How is breakfast really healthy?<br/><br/>In the morning like an emperor, at noon like a king, in the evening like a beggar – goes a well-known proverb. A study by the medical organization Endocrine Society confirms the key message behind the saying: It shows that breakfast plays a more important role than is often assumed. In the morning, the human body actually has more than twice as high a metabolic activity as at other times of the day: A large breakfast not only keeps you full for a long time, blood sugar and insulin levels also rise slowly. The appetite for sweets is regulated, we eat snacks less often during the day. Therefore, breakfast should not be skipped even during a diet.<br/><br/>Of course, having a big breakfast doesn't mean that we should have several croissants with nut nougat cream and sweet breakfast pancakes in the morning. Breakfast is healthy best when it is high in protein and fiber, as well as providing vitamins and minerals. Whole grain bread or muesli, oat flakes, fruits and nuts are energy suppliers that are good for you and keep you full for a long time.<br/><br/>The fact that a large breakfast is better than a large dinner does not necessarily mean that breakfast is essential for losing weight. A meta-analysis carried out in 2019 showed, that the total daily energy intake of people who eat breakfast is on average higher, than that of those who do not have breakfast. The latter were on average just under half a kilo lighter. So, according to the results of this major study, you don't necessarily have to eat breakfast if you want to lose weight.<br/><br/>Lose weight with the right diet – that's how easy it is to put healthy on your plate<br/><br/>Eating healthy in no way means less taste. Fresh vegetables, fish or meat as protein sources and other healthy ingredients conjure up taste in the pot and a smile on your lips – ideally also when you step on the scales. A US study has shown that people who cook their own food and consciously deal with what they eat have a body mass index in the normal range. Restaurant visits or fast food, on the other hand, quickly lure you into the sugar trap: Often there is no indication of how much sugar is in salad dressings, how much fat the potatoes were fried in or whether the meat was not treated.<br/><br/>A healthy lunch consists of three parts – the largest part is fruits or vegetables and should cover half of the plate. A quarter of the meal should consist of protein, i.e. fish, meat or tofu. The remaining quarter consists of carbohydrates and is ideally made from whole grain products. Important: Don't eat at your desk in the office, but stimulate your metabolism and ideally take a short walk before or after lunch.<br/><br/>When should you eat to lose weight?<br/><br/>In the evening, you should focus on light meals that are rather low in carbohydrates. These are the least likely to cause insulin to skyrocket, which is good for our body. Vegetables, dairy products and nuts, for example, are well suited for this.<br/><br/>You should also be careful not to have dinner too late. It is best to have eaten until 7 p.m. – then the body can relax and prepare for the night. Sufficient sleep is important for healthy weight loss. A US study found that people who slept about eight hours a night had better fat deposits. So good night! Allow yourself more than six hours of sleep so that you can start the next day fit and refreshed.<br/><br/>Losing weight without exercise – is it really possible?<br/><br/>It would be so easy, if the dream weight could be achieved simply by lowering the calorie intake. But you probably know the wisdom that diet is only one side of the coin and exercise is the other. So nothing helps: Put on your sportswear and off you go!<br/><br/>Anyone who, in addition to the sports program such as jogging, walking or swimming, also lets the elevator go alone and takes the stairs, takes a little detour or uses the bike instead of the car, is doing wellis also called something good. Even simple walking is good for health. | Paras ravitsemus ja liikunta laihtumiseen<br/><br/>Miten aamiainen on oikeasti terveellinen?<br/><br/>Aamulla kuin keisari, keskipäivällä kuin kuningas, illalla kuin kerjäläinen – menee tunnettu sananlasku. Lääkärijärjestön Endocrine Societyn tutkimus vahvistaa keskeisen sanoman sanonnan takana: Se osoittaa, että aamiaisella on tärkeämpi rooli kuin usein oletetaan. Aamulla ihmisen elimistöllä on itse asiassa yli kaksi kertaa enemmän metabolista aktiivisuutta kuin muina vuorokaudenaikoina: runsas aamiainen paitsi pitää sinut kylläisenä pitkään, myös verensokeri ja insuliinitasot nousevat hitaasti. Makeisten ruokahalu on säännelty, syömme välipaloja harvemmin päivän aikana. Siksi aamiaista ei pidä jättää väliin edes ruokavalion aikana.<br/><br/>Iso aamiainen ei tietenkään tarkoita sitä, että aamulla pitäisi syödä useita croissanteja, joissa on pähkinänougat-kermaa ja makeita aamiaispannukakkuja. Aamiainen on terveellinen, kun se sisältää runsaasti proteiinia ja kuitua, sekä tarjoaa vitamiineja ja kivennäisaineita. Täysjyväleipä tai mysli, kaurahiutaleet, hedelmät ja pähkinät ovat energiantoimittajia, jotka ovat hyviä sinulle ja pitävät sinut kylläisenä pitkään.<br/><br/>Se, että suuri aamiainen on parempi kuin suuri illallinen, ei välttämättä tarkoita, että aamiainen on välttämätön painonpudotuksessa. Vuonna 2019 tehty meta-analyysi osoitti, että aamiaista syövien ihmisten päivittäinen kokonaisenergiansaanti on keskimäärin suurempi kuin niiden, jotka eivät syö aamiaista, ja jälkimmäiset olivat keskimäärin alle puoli kiloa kevyempiä. Niinpä tämän merkittävän tutkimuksen tulosten mukaan sinun ei välttämättä tarvitse syödä aamiaista, jos haluat laihtua.<br/><br/>Laihtua oikealla ruokavaliolla – näin helppoa on laittaa terveellistä lautaselle<br/><br/>Terveellinen syöminen ei missään tapauksessa tarkoita maun vähenemistä. Tuoreet vihannekset, kala tai liha proteiinilähteinä ja muut terveelliset ainesosat loihtivat makua kattilassa ja hymyn huulille – ihannetapauksessa myös astellessa vaa'alla. Yhdysvaltalainen tutkimus on osoittanut, että ihmisillä, jotka valmistavat itse ruokansa ja käsittelevät tietoisesti sitä, mitä syövät, on normaalipainoindeksi. Ravintolakäynnit tai pikaruoka taas houkuttelevat nopeasti sokeriansaan: Useinkaan ei ole mitään viitteitä siitä, kuinka paljon sokeria salaatinkastikkeissa on, kuinka paljon rasvaa perunat ovat paistuneet tai onko lihaa käsitelty.<br/><br/>Terveellinen lounas koostuu kolmesta osasta – suurin osa on hedelmiä tai vihanneksia ja sen tulisi kattaa puolet lautasesta. Neljännes aterian tulisi koostua proteiinista eli kalasta, lihasta tai tofusta. Jäljelle jäävä neljännes koostuu hiilihydraateista ja se on ihanteellisesti valmistettu täysjyvätuotteista. Tärkeää: Älä syö työpöydällä toimistossa, vaan stimuloi aineenvaihduntaa ja mieluiten käydä lyhyellä kävelyllä ennen lounasta tai sen jälkeen.<br/><br/>Milloin sinun pitäisi syödä laihtua?<br/><br/>Illalla kannattaa keskittyä kevyisiin aterioihin, joissa on melko vähän hiilihydraatteja. Nämä aiheuttavat vähiten insuliinin nousun räjähdysmäisesti, mikä on hyväksi kehollemme. Tähän sopivat hyvin esimerkiksi vihannekset, maitotuotteet ja pähkinät.<br/><br/>On myös syytä varoa syömästä liian myöhään. On parasta syödä vasta klo 19 – sitten keho voi rentoutua ja valmistautua yöhön. Riittävä uni on tärkeää terveellisen painonpudotuksen kannalta. Yhdysvaltalaisessa tutkimuksessa havaittiin, että noin kahdeksan tuntia yössä nukkuvilla ihmisillä oli paremmat rasvakertymät. Joten hyvää yötä! Anna itsellesi enemmän kuin kuusi tuntia unta, jotta voit aloittaa seuraavan päivän kunnossa ja virkistyneenä.<br/><br/>Laihtuminen ilman liikuntaa – onko se todella mahdollista?<br/><br/>Se olisi niin helppoa, jos unelmapaino voitaisiin saavuttaa yksinkertaisesti alentamalla kalorimäärää. Mutta luultavasti tiedät viisauden, että ruokavalio on vain kolikon toinen puoli ja liikunta on toinen. Joten mikään ei auta: Pue urheiluvaatteet ja mene!<br/><br/>Jokainen, joka urheiluohjelman, kuten lenkkeilyn, kävelyn tai uinnin, lisäksi antaa hissin mennä yksin ja ottaa portaat, vie vähän kiertotietä tai käyttää pyörää auton sijasta, tekee hyvinkutsutaan myös jotain hyvää. Yksinkertainenkin kävely on hyväksi terveydelle. |
| Why We Open Sourced the Anvil App Server<br/><br/>Why Open Source?<br/><br/>A little while ago, we open-sourced the Anvil App Server. The community reaction has been great, even a little overwhelming (yes, every reply to that announcement really did land in my inbox!). We've already incorporated a bunch of that feedback into our version 1.2 release. But we keep getting asked, " Why did you open-source such a core part of your product? "<br/><br/>Why do this at all?<br/><br/>Anvil is a tool that makes it as simple as possible to build a web app. We do that by enabling you to build the whole application in one language, Python.<br/><br/>Simple hosting is part of that.<br/><br/>The web platform is broken , and Anvil is our attempt to fix it. And, because there is so much complexity in deploying a web app, a cloud-hosted service was the best way to provide the simplicity we want. That way, you can build your app in the Anvil Editor, and make it live on the Internet with one click.<br/><br/>But we kept hearing from people who said, "that's great, but…"<br/><br/>"…but I need to run this on an offshore platform without reliable internet access"<br/><br/>"…but I want to package my app into an IoT device I sell"<br/><br/>or simply, "…but if I'm putting my eggs in this basket, how can I be sure I can still run my app in ten years' time?"<br/><br/>These are all good points! A cloud service isn't the right solution for everyone. If we want to serve these users, there's got to be some way for them to get their apps out of Anvil and run them locally, under their own complete control.<br/><br/>Open Source: Escape hatch, not an ejector seat<br/><br/>We believe in escape hatches, not ejector seats. At conferences, we sometimes get asked, "can I export this as a Flask+JS app?". Sure, it would be possible – we could generate a server package, compile the client-side Python to Javascript, and spit out a classic web app. But it would have serious drawbacks, because:<br/><br/>Not a comfy ride.<br/><br/>Code generation is an ejector seat. Generated code is better than nothing – at least you can edit it! But the moment you edit that code, you lose all the benefits of the system that generated it. If you're using Anvil because of its drag-and-drop editor and Python in the browser, why should our locally-hosted users have to use vim and Javascript?<br/><br/>So we did it the right way: we open-sourced Anvil's runtime engine. It's the same code that serves your app in our hosted service, and it represents your app the same way. You can edit your code with a text editor, run it, then git push it back into our online IDE. It's not an ejector seat: there's no explosive transition. It's an escape hatch: you can climb out, and climb right back in.<br/><br/>What about our business model?<br/><br/>Anvil was never meant to be one of those enterprise low-code systems that charge you $20/mo for each person who uses your app. Anvil is a developer tool. The apps you develop are yours. Enabling you to run them on a Raspberry Pi is cool, but it doesn't change our business model.<br/><br/>We're doing what we always were: We make and sell a development tool that makes it drastically simpler to build web applications. We provide hosting for Anvil apps. We offer the entire development-and-hosting platform on-site for enterprise customers. And, of course, we offer a free plan so that everyone can use Anvil for hobby or educational purposes – or to start building something and see how it goes.<br/><br/>We've open-sourced the Anvil App Server for the (relatively small) number of people who need it, and to provide the ultimate insurance policy. Sure, you can build an app with vim and host it yourself, without even registering an account with us (we've got docs to show you how!). But the Anvil Editor is the world's easiest way to build a web app, and our hosted service is the easiest way to deploy it – so that's what we expect most of our users to continue doing. And you can build with confidence, knowing that the open-source code is right there if you need it.<br/><br/>Try it yourself<br/><br/>If our development philosophy resonates with you, why not try Anvil yourself? | Miksi avasimme Anvil App Serverin<br/><br/>Miksi avoin lähdekoodi?<br/><br/>Vähän aikaa sitten avasimme Anvil App Serverin. Yhteisön reaktio on ollut suuri, jopa hieman ylivoimainen (kyllä, jokainen vastaus kyseiseen ilmoitukseen todella laskeutui postilaatikkooni!). Olemme jo sisällyttäneet nipun tätä palautetta versioon 1.2 julkaisuun. Mutta meiltä kysytään jatkuvasti, "Miksi avasit tällaisen ydinosan tuotteestasi?"<br/><br/>Miksi ylipäänsä tehdä näin?<br/><br/>Anvil on työkalu, jonka avulla web-sovelluksen rakentaminen on mahdollisimman yksinkertaista. Teemme sen mahdollistamalla koko sovelluksen rakentamisen yhdellä kielellä, Pythonilla.<br/><br/>Yksinkertainen isännöinti on osa sitä.<br/><br/>Verkkoalusta on rikki , ja Anvil on yrityksemme korjata se. Ja koska web-sovelluksen käyttöönotossa on niin paljon monimutkaisuutta, pilvipohjainen palvelu oli paras tapa tarjota haluamamme yksinkertaisuus. Näin voit rakentaa sovelluksesi Anvil Editorissa ja saada sen elämään Internetissä yhdellä klikkauksella.<br/><br/>Kuulimme kuitenkin jatkuvasti ihmisiltä, jotka sanoivat: "Hienoa, mutta..."<br/><br/>"...mutta minun täytyy pyörittää tätä offshore-alustalla ilman luotettavaa internetyhteyttä"<br/><br/>"...mutta haluan paketoida sovellukseni myymääni IoT-laitteeseen"<br/><br/>tai yksinkertaisesti, "...mutta jos laitan munat tähän koriin, kuinka voin olla varma, että voin vielä ajaa sovellukseni kymmenen vuoden kuluttua?"<br/><br/>Nämä ovat kaikki hyviä kohtia! Pilvipalvelu ei ole oikea ratkaisu kaikille. Jos haluamme palvella näitä käyttäjiä, on oltava jokin keino, jolla he voivat saada sovelluksensa pois Anvilista ja ajaa niitä paikallisesti, omalla täydellisellä hallinnallaan.<br/><br/>Avoin lähdekoodi: Pakoluukku, ei heittoistuin<br/><br/>Uskomme pakoluukuihin, emme heittoistuimiin. Konferenssissa meiltä kysytään joskus: "voinko viedä tämän Flask+JS-sovelluksena?". Toki se olisi mahdollista – voisimme luoda palvelinpaketin, kääntää asiakaspuolen Pythonin Javascriptiin ja sylkäistä esiin klassisen web-sovelluksen. Mutta sillä olisi vakavia haittoja, koska:<br/><br/>Ei mukavaa kyytiä.<br/><br/>Koodin generointi on ejektorin paikka. Luotu koodi on parempi kuin ei mitään – ainakin voit muokata sitä! Mutta sillä hetkellä kun muokkaat kyseistä koodia, menetät kaikki sen luoneen järjestelmän edut. Jos käytät Anvilia sen vetävän ja pudottavan editorin ja Pythonin takia selaimessa, miksi paikallisesti isännöityjen käyttäjien pitäisi käyttää vimiä ja Javascriptiä?<br/><br/>Joten teimme sen oikein: avoimella lähdekoodilla Anvilin runtime-moottori. Se on sama koodi, joka palvelee sovellustasi isännöidyssä palvelussamme, ja se edustaa sovellustasi samalla tavalla. Voit muokata koodia tekstieditorilla, suorittaa sen, sitten git työntää sen takaisin online-IDE: hen. Se ei ole heittoistuin: ei ole räjähtävää siirtymää. Se on pakoluukku: voit kiivetä ulos, ja kiivetä takaisin sisään.<br/><br/>Entä liiketoimintamallimme?<br/><br/>Anvilin ei koskaan ollut tarkoitus olla yksi niistä yrityksen matalan koodin järjestelmistä, jotka veloittavat sinulta 20 dollaria kuukaudessa jokaisesta sovellustasi käyttävästä henkilöstä. Anvil on kehittäjätyökalu. Kehittämäsi sovellukset ovat sinun. Niiden ajaminen Raspberry Pi:llä on siistiä, mutta se ei muuta liiketoimintamalliamme.<br/><br/>Teemme sitä, mitä olemme aina olleet: Valmistamme ja myymme kehitystyökalun, joka tekee web-sovellusten rakentamisesta huomattavasti yksinkertaisempaa. Tarjoamme hostausta Anvil-sovelluksille. Tarjoamme koko kehitys- ja isännöintialustan paikan päällä yritysasiakkaille. Ja tietenkin tarjoamme ilmaisen suunnitelman, jotta jokainen voi käyttää Anvilia harrastus- tai opetustarkoituksiin – tai alkaa rakentaa jotain ja katsoa, miten se menee.<br/><br/>Olemme avoimen lähdekoodin Anvil App Server (suhteellisen pieni) määrä ihmisiä, jotka tarvitsevat sitä, ja tarjota perimmäinen vakuutus. Toki voit rakentaa sovelluksen vimin kanssa ja isännöidä sitä itse, edes rekisteröimättä tiliä kanssamme (meillä on dokumentteja, jotka näyttävät miten!). Anvil Editor on kuitenkin maailman helpoin tapa rakentaa verkkosovellus, ja isännöity palvelumme on helpoin tapa ottaa se käyttöön – joten odotamme useimpien käyttäjiemme jatkavan sitä. Ja voit rakentaa luottavaisin mielin tietäen, että avoimen lähdekoodin koodi on siellä, jos tarvitset sitä.<br/><br/>Kokeile itse<br/><br/>Jos kehitysfilosofiamme resonoi kanssasi, mikset kokeilisi itse Anvilia? |
