| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Leclaire<br/><br/>Historiallinen Leclairen kaupunginosa, jota kutsuttiin aikoinaan Edwardsvillen "eteläiseksi esikaupungiksi", perustettiin osuuskuntana vuonna 1890 ja se säilyi erillisenä kylänä, kunnes liitettiin Edwardsvillen kaupunkiin vuonna 1934. Leclaire-kokeesta kertoivat sanoma- ja aikakauslehdet eri puolilla Yhdysvaltoja ja Eurooppaa, erityisesti sen olemassaolon ensimmäisten 20 vuoden aikana. Vuonna 1979, ainutlaatuisen historiansa vuoksi, entinen kylä listattiin National Register of Historic Places -rekisteriin.<br/><br/>Leclairen perusti Nelson Oliver Nelson, St. Louisin putkivalmistaja, joka pyrki monien vuosien ajan edistämään työväenluokan ahdinkoa. Nelson halusi parantaa työntekijöidensä työoloja ja tarjota asuntoja tehtaiden lähellä, jotta työntekijät ja heidän perheensä voisivat helposti osallistua yrityksen maksutta tarjoamiin virkistys- ja koulutusohjelmiin. Ennen vuotta 1890 ollessaan vielä St. Louisissa N. O. Nelson Companyn valmistus- ja jakeluliiketoiminnot alkoivat tarjota voitonjakoa koulutus- ja virkistysmahdollisuuksien ohella. Leclairen yhteistyökokeilu tuottaisi lisähyötyä.<br/><br/>Kun Nelsonin työntekijät ilmoittivat haluavansa muuttaa maaseudulle, yritysten edustajat lähestyivät pienten kaupunkien johtajia useissa Missourin ja Illinoisin yhteisöissä lähellä St. Louisin päämajaansa. He etsivät sopivaa tonttia uusien tehtaiden ja mallikylän rakentamiseksi. Edwardsvillen eteläpuolelta he löysivät 125 eekkerin laajuisen maa-alueen, josta oli saatavilla vettä, hiiltä ja kuljetusvälineitä. Paikalliset liikemiehet toimivat nopeasti tarjotakseen rahallisen kannustimen. Alle kolmessa viikossa yhteisö keräsi 20 000 dollarin rahaston yksittäisistä yhden ja tuhannen dollarin lahjoituksista houkutellakseen Nelsonin valitsemaan Edwardsvillen yritykselleen.<br/><br/>Kaupungin johtajat olivat toivoneet löytävänsä kiinteistöjä Edwardsvillen kaupungin rajojen sisältä, mutta kun sopivaa paikkaa ei löytynyt, he luottivat siihen, että Nelsonin sijoitus kaupungin eteläpuolella tulisi pian osaksi Edwardsvilleä. Vaikka Nelson täytti kaikki rakennus- ja työpaikkojen luontiehdot sopimuksessaan, kestäisi 44 vuotta ennen kuin hänet liitettäisiin Edwardsvilleen. Leclaire, joka rajoittui Madison/Brown Avenuesiin itään, rautatiekiskoihin länteen, Hadley/McKinley Avenuesiin etelään ja Wolf Streetiin pohjoiseen, pysyi itsenäisenä kylänä vuodesta 1890 vuoteen 1934. Tuona aikana se sai mainetta innovaatioista liike-elämässä, koulutuksessa ja asuntosuunnittelussa.<br/><br/>Leclairen kylä Edwardsvillen kartassa vuodelta 1931<br/>Kohteliaisuus Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelsonin päätöstä kylän rakentamisesta ei tehty hetken mielijohteesta. 1880-luvun lopulla hän oli kansainvälinen johtaja yhteistyön ja voitonjaon alalla vaihtaen sosiaalisia teorioita muiden kanssa ympäri maailmaa laajentaen samalla St. Louisin liiketoimintaansa. Hän nimesi kokeellisen kylänsä pariisilaisen voitonjakajan Edme Jean Leclairen mukaan, mutta hän vieraili monien muiden yhteiskunnallisten visionääreiden luona, jotka tarjosivat tietoa ja inspiraatiota. Kooten parhaat ideat näistä esimerkeistä Nelson perusti Leclairen, sanoillaan, "antamaan työtä, edistämään älykkyyttä, tarjoamaan virkistystä, vaalimaan kauneutta ja tekemään koteja." Nämä olivat kaikki tekijöitä, jotka hän määritteli tarpeellisiksi miehille elää täyttä elämää. Myöhemmät kirjoittajat käyttivät näitä sanoja muotoillakseen Leclairen perusperiaatteet: Työ, kodit, koulutus, virkistys ja kauneus, mutta lisäksi tärkeä vapauden periaate.<br/><br/>Työ<br/><br/>Työtä voitiin pitää tärkeimpänä näistä tekijöistä, sillä ilman Leclairen tehdastöitä kylää ei olisi. Tiilitehtaan rakennukset suunnitteli arkkitehti E. A. Cameron tarkoituksenaan tuottaa luonnonvaloa, kesällä ilmanvaihtoa ja talvella lattialämmitystä. Käytössä oli palonsammutusjärjestelmä, ja vaikka teollisuusonnettomuuksia ei saatukaan poistettua, pyrittiin kaikin keinoin takaamaan työntekijöiden turvallisuus. Murattipäällysteisiä tiilirakennuksia ympäröivät hyvin hoidetut nurmikot ja kukkapuutarhat, jotka antavat kompleksille kampusmaisen ulkonäön. Vuonna 1894 New York Worldin reportteri Nellie Bly kutsui rakennuksia "ihanteelliseksi rakennusten täydellisyydeksi, jossa ihminen voi työskennellä".<br/><br/>N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Companyn tuotantokompleksi Leclairessa<br/>Leclairen ystäviltä<br/><br/>Nelsonin yhtiön toimintaperiaatteet oli suunniteltu suojaamaan työntekijöiden taloudellista vakautta. Työntekijät voisivat ansaita osan voitoista ja saada äänensä kuuluville yhtiössä, jos he valitsisivat sen vaihtoehdon. Voitonjakosuunnitelma antoi Nelsonin työntekijöille omistuksen ylpeyden, joka johti tukevaan työvoimaan. Vuosien varrella oli muutamia lyhytaikaisia työlakkoja, mutta suurimmaksi osaksi työvoimaongelmat olivat harvinaisia. Työntekijöillä oli myös kohtuulliset työajat ja kilpailukykyiset palkat. Oli olemassa eläkkeitä ja sairauslomia varattava rahasto sekä leskeneläkkeet, jos työntekijä kuoli, liittyipä kuolema hänen työhönsä tai ei.<br/><br/>Yhtiön pääkonttori N. O. Nelson Companylle (NONCO) jäi St. Louisiin, mutta koko N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company siirrettiin Leclaireen. Valmistusyhtiö jaettiin myymälöihin, jotka valmistivat erilaisia tuotteita. Vuonna 1900 kaupoista tuli itsenäisiä yrityksiä verotuksessa, mutta kaikki olivat edelleen N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Companyn omistuksessa. Myymälöihin kuului Kaappitehdas, jossa valmistettiin puutuotteita kabinetista myllyyn. Ammattitaitoiset käsityöläiset, jotka työskentelivät täällä, täyttivät myös erityisiä sopimuksia, mukaan lukien pankkivirkailijan häkit paikalliselle pankille ja alttari, joka on edelleen käytössä St. Andrew's Episcopal Churchissa Edwardsvillessä. Marble Shop erikoistui arkkitehtoniseen marmoriin, jonka Nelsonin miehistö leikkasi ja asensi koteihin, yrityksiin ja jopa osavaltion pääkaupunkeihin koko keskilännessä. Konepaja, josta tuli Bignall ja Keeler, valmisti putkien asennuskoneita, pumppuja, mittareita ja erilaisia mekaanisia työkaluja, joita putkikaupassa odotettiin. He myös haarautuivat valmistamaan erikoistuotteita, kuten Leclaire Bicycle 1890-luvun puolivälissä. Brass Shopiin kuului valimo, jossa valmistettiin erilaisia putkistoja ja työkaluja. Nämä esimerkit edustavat vain osaa Leclairen tehtailla tehdystä työstä. Yhtiön logo oli tyylitelty "Nonco", joka näkyy yhä putkistoissa ja joissain paloposteissa Edwardsvillessä tänään.<br/><br/>Kodit<br/><br/>Ennen kuin asuntoja voitiin rakentaa, tarvittiin asuntoja niin tehdasrakennuksia viimeistelleille kuin koteja rakentavillekin työntekijöille. Näihin tarpeisiin yhtiö rakensi "Club Housen", suuren rakennuksen, joka palveli monia tarkoituksia. Majoituksen lisäksi se oli yhteisön ensimmäinen opetusrakennus, ja se sisälsi hyvin varustetun kirjaston.<br/><br/>Leclairen asuinalueen rakentaminen alkoi heti kylän perustamisen jälkeen kesäkuussa 1890. Julius Pitzman, innovatiivinen maisema-arkkitehti, joka asetti ensimmäiset erät Leclaireen, asetti ne useisiin suojaaviin liittoihin. Liitot säätivät leveitä, mutkaisia katuja, suuria tontteja ja kauppakirjan rajoituksen, joka rajoitti kiinteistöt vain asuin- tai opetustarkoituksiin. Yhtiö päällysti kadut, toimitti sähköiset katuvalot, asensi jalkakäytävät ja istutti satoja puita Leclairen kaduille. Myöhemmät Leclairen osat oli aseteltu tavanomaisella ruuturakenteella ja pienemmillä erillä, mutta niihin sisältyi silti kauppakirjan rajoitukset.<br/><br/>Leclairen viktoriaaninen mökki vuonna 1907<br/>Pääosat Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Aluksi yhtiö rakensi asunnot, minkä jälkeen ne myytiin lähihintaan Nelsonin työntekijöille kodin omistamisen kannustamiseksi. Jos työntekijä sairastui eikä voinut tehdä asuntolainaansa, maksut keskeytettiin, kunnes hän palasi töihin. Koteja tarjottiin monenlaisissa taloissa ja yhtiö mainosti, ettei kahta samanlaista asuntoa ollut. Varhaisimmat kodit olivat pääasiassa viktoriaanisia mökkejä, jotka tulivat sähkön ja juoksevan veden mukana. Näitä seurasivat bungalowit, foursquares ja jopa jotkut kit-kodit. Asukkaat voisivat ostaa yrityksen rakentaman kodin tai ostaa tyhjän erän ja rakentaa talon itse, jos arkkitehtoninen suunnittelu täyttäisi yrityksen standardit.<br/><br/>Myöhempinä vuosina erät myytiin sijoittajille, yleensä Edwardsvillen asukkaille, ja monet 1920-luvulla rakennetut kodit rakensivat paikalliset urakoitsijat, jotka sitten myivät ne alueen asukkaille.<br/><br/>Koulutus<br/><br/>Nelson uskoi koulutukseen kaikille, myös työväenluokalle.Ohjelmointi alkoi päiväkodista Klubitalolla vuonna 1892 ja jatkui uudessa koulutusrakennuksessa osoitteessa 722 Holyoake Road. Yleisesti "Koulutaloksi" kutsuttu rakennus tarjosi suuren salin kokouksia ja ohjelmia varten, mutta siinä oli siirrettävät väliseinät, jotka jakoivat sen luokkatilaan päivän aikana. Iltaisin oli Leclaire Self-Culture Clubin tansseja, kokouksia tai ohjelmia, joissa oli Washingtonin yliopiston professorien tai kansallisesti tunnettujen puhujien viikoittaisia luentoja, jotka N. O. Nelsonin tavoin olivat osa vuosisadan vaihteen sosiaalista parannusliikettä. Näihin kuuluivat muun muassa Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones ja kirjailija Charlotte Perkins Gilman.<br/><br/>Lapset ilmoittautuivat Leclairen lastentarhaan vuonna 1913<br/>Pääosat Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Kymmenenä vuonna 1895 rakennetun koulutusrakennuksen jälkeen oli sarja koulutuskokeiluja, mukaan lukien teollisuuskoulu, korkeakoulu, yökoulu ja akatemia. Varhaisin ja pitkäikäisin yritys oli vuonna 1892 perustettu aamupäiväkoti, jossa käytettiin Fröbel-mallia. Tämä kaksivuotinen ohjelma oli ilmainen kaikille, myös Edwardsvillen lapsille, vuoteen 1931 saakka, jolloin yhtiö alkoi taloudellisista syistä periä lukukausimaksuja opiskelijoilta, jotka eivät olleet työntekijöiden lapsia. Nelson Manufacturing hoiti lastentarhaa vuoteen 1934, jolloin rakennus luovutettiin nimellistä maksua vastaan Edwardsvillen koulupiirille.<br/><br/>Virkistys<br/><br/>Veneilijät Leclaire-järvellä vuonna 1915<br/>Pääosat Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Virkistys oli Leclairen tärkeä ominaisuus. Yhtiö tarjosi urheilutiloja baseballille, tennikselle ja myöhemmin jalkapallolle. Rakennettiin keilailu- ja biljardihalli ja siellä oli järvi veneilyä, uintia, kalastusta tai luistelua varten talvella. Leclaire Parkiin oli sisustettu venevajoja, mies- ja naiskylpylöitä sekä suuri paviljonki. Asukkaat järjestivät tansseja, heinäjuhlia, oikeinkirjoitusmehiläisiä ja muita aktiviteetteja, ja yhtiö sponsoroi yhtyettä, joka soitti säännöllisesti kylän tai Edwardsvillen viihteissä. Kuten Club Housen ja School Housen koulutustoiminnot, Leclairen virkistysmahdollisuudet olivat avoimia kaikille ja olivat usein Edwardsvillen ja jopa St. Louisin vierailijoiden kohde.<br/><br/>Kauneus<br/><br/>Varhainen valokuva Leclaire-järvestä<br/>Pääosat Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Viimeinen niistä tekijöistä, joita Nelson piti tärkeinä tyydyttävän elämän kannalta, koski ympäristöä. Hän arvosti maasta löytyvää kauneutta ja puhtautta ja rohkaisi kaikkia Leclairessa kaunistamaan omaisuuttaan istuttamalla puutarhoja ja hedelmätarhoja. Nelson itse johti esimerkillään, joten yrityksen kasvihuoneesta saatiin ilmaisia kukkia ja kauneimmille pihoille järjestettiin kilpailuja. Leclaire sijoitettiin niin, että koko kylällä oli vielä nykyäänkin nähtävissä puistomainen miljöö.<br/><br/>Vapaus<br/><br/>Leclaire Osuuskauppa<br/>Pääosat Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listasi Leclairelle viisi perusperiaatetta, mutta nykyaikaiset kirjailijat lisäävät kuudennen: Vapaus. Kaikki yhtiön tarjoamat ohjelmat olivat niin työntekijöiden kuin paikallisten asukkaiden käytettävissä, mutta mikään ei ollut pakollista. Vapaus valita, osallistuuko yritysohjelmiin vai ei, oli täysin yksilön päätettävissä. Leclairen asukkaat saattoivat työskennellä Nelson Manufacturingille tai muualle, eikä työntekijöillä ollut velvollisuutta asua Leclairessa. Vapaa-ajan- ja opetusohjelmiin osallistuminen oli myös vapaaehtoista. Siellä oli myös yrityskauppa, jossa työntekijät saattoivat tehdä ostoksia, mutta muista yrityskaupungeista poiketen kukaan ei ollut velkaa yrityskaupalle. Leclaire Store oli osuuskunta, jossa jäseniltä perittiin oikeudenmukaiset markkinahinnat, mutta heille maksettiin sitten neljännesvuosittaiset osingot.<br/><br/>Erilainen yrityskaupunki<br/><br/>Kaikki nämä edut tekivät Leclairesta ainutlaatuisen muista yrityskaupungeista, mutta oli myös yksittäisiä tapauksia, joissa yritys osoitti myötätuntoa ja huolenpitoa työntekijöitä kohtaan. Yhtiö sulki tehtaat ja palkkasi retkijunia viemään työntekijöitä ja heidän perheitään St. Louisiin päiväksi vuoden 1904 St. Louisin maailmannäyttelyyn. Kun raha oli tiukassa, Nelson laittoi silloin tällöin ylimääräistä rahaa jokaiseen palkkakuoreen helpottaakseen työntekijöiden elämää, ja jos hän pani alulle ohjelman, josta miehet eivät olleet samaa mieltä, he puhuivat siitä ja niin usein kuin eivät, Nelson peruutti itsensä.<br/><br/>Norjan Lillesandissa vuonna 1841 syntynyt N. O. Nelson oli monimutkainen mies: hän oli kapitalisti, joka uskoi vapaaseen yritteliäisyyteen, mutta myös sosialisti, "kultaisen säännön" seuraaja ja patriootti, joka palveli unionia sisällissodassa. Vuoteen 1900 mennessä hän oli monimiljonääri, mutta jo kuollessaan vuonna 1922 hän oli antanut kaiken pois työväenluokan kohentamiseksi.<br/><br/>Vaikka Leclaire ei ollut Nelsonin ainoa sosiaalinen kokeilu, sitä pidetään hänen menestyksekkäimpänä pyrkimyksenään. Muita merkittäviä pyrkimyksiä sosiaalisen kohentamisen puolesta olivat osuustoiminnallisten ruokakauppojen ketju New Orleansissa, mustien työntekijöiden lasten päiväkoti hänen Bessemerissä, Alabamassa, tehtaissa ja kulutustavaroiden koti Indiossa, Kaliforniassa.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire oli kansainvälisesti tunnettu merkittävänä ja onnistuneena kokeiluna. Sitä kuvattiin New Yorkin maailmassa lukuisia kertoja, mutta erityisesti toimittaja Nellie Bly kirjoitti vuonna 1894 pitkään mallikaupungista, jossa "työkysymys on ratkaistu ja kaikki ovat onnellisia pienessä kylässä lähellä St. Louisia." Myös Los Angeles Times raportoi säännöllisesti N. O. Nelsonista, samoin Chicago Daily Tribune ja lukuisat muut julkaisut.<br/><br/>Puheessaan Leclairen 15-vuotisjuhlissa vuonna 1915 Nelson sanoi: "Leclaire ulottaa sinulle laajan avoimen vieraanvaraisuuden, ja tarjoaa sinulle nauttia tänään siitä helppoudesta ja mukavuudesta ja kauneudesta ja inspiraatiosta, josta nautimme joka päivä." Tuosta päivästä on kulunut yli vuosisata, mutta kutsu on yhä voimassa. Asukkaita ja tutkijoita kehotetaan tutustumaan Leclairen historiaan ja pohtimaan, mitä voitaisiin oppia tulevien sukupolvien kohentamiseksi.<br/><br/>Yksi valmistuskompleksin entisistä rakennuksista vuonna 2019, joka toimii nykyään Lewisin ja Clark Community Collegen N.

Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Tekijä vierailee Zoomin tai Skypen kautta<br/><br/>Skype on loistava vaihtoehto kouluille/luokille, jotka eivät tuo omia kirjailijoita, mutta jotka haluavat tutustua kirjoihin ja runouteen, olla yhteydessä tekijään ja esittää kysymyksiä kahden kesken.<br/><br/>Kustannukset<br/><br/>Tarjoan 30-45 minuutin Zoom- tai Skype-käyntejä koulujen kanssa 125 dollaria per istunto (tai 200 dollaria kahdelle istunnolle, jotka tapahtuvat kolmen tunnin sisällä aamulla tai iltapäivällä; 325 dollaria kolmelle istunnolle yhdessä päivässä; 425 dollaria neljälle istunnolle yhdessä päivässä). Jokaisessa sessiossa pyrin saamaan lapset mahdollisimman aktiivisesti mukaan. Ei, se ei ole samanlainen yhteys kuin henkilökohtainen vierailu tarjoaa, mutta se voi silti olla innostava ja motivoiva lapsille!<br/><br/>Mitä teen<br/><br/>Jokaiseen enintään 50 opiskelijan istuntoon sisältyy:<br/><br/>5 minuuttia tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segmenttiä 10 ish-minuuttia kukin – Voit valita:<br/><br/>Miten minusta tuli kirjailija<br/><br/>Tämän kirjan kirjoittaminen (valitse itse, mihin kirjaan keskityn)<br/><br/>Lukeminen (Luen joitakin runoja ja lapset auttavat minua lukemaan muita)<br/><br/>Luokkahuoneen esitys (oppilaasi laittoivat lukemisen tai esityksen minulle - erittäin arvostava yleisö!)<br/><br/>Runon kirjoittaminen yhdessä<br/><br/>Kysymys- ja vastaustilaisuus<br/><br/>5 minuuttia kääreitä/hyvästit<br/><br/>Keskustelen myös esiopettajien tai täydennysopettajien ryhmien kanssa runoudesta ja kirjoittamisesta.<br/><br/>Vinkkejä mahtavaan virtuaalivierailuun<br/><br/>Vinkkejä onnistuneeseen virtuaalivierailuun<br/><br/>Yksi tavoitteistani virtuaalisille kouluvierailuille on kaapata interaktiivisuus, joka tekee henkilökohtaisista vierailuista onnistuneita ja hauskoja. Mutta totuus on, että joskus on vaikea olla virtuaalisesti vuorovaikutteinen! Ajoitus ei välttämättä täsmää oikein, mikä tekee yhdessä lukemisesta haasteellista, ja minun on todella vaikea kuulla yksittäisiä oppilaita, elleivät he tule esiin ja puhu suoraan mikrofoniin/tietokoneeseen. Mutta joidenkin kokeilujen ja virheiden jälkeen olen löytänyt joitakin tapoja saada parhaat mahdolliset virtuaalivierailut. Tässä ne ovat: 10 tapaa tehdä vierailustasi opiskelijoiden kanssa hieno kokemus!<br/><br/>Ennen vierailua<br/><br/>Saata lapset mahdollisimman innostumaan vierailusta. Käy verkkosivuillani heidän kanssaan. Lue joitain kirjoistani heidän kanssaan. Kerää joitain kysymyksiä, joita opiskelijoilla on minulle. Kaikki, mitä teet etukäteen, jotta se tuntuu isolta sopimukselta, menee pitkälle kohti opiskelijoiden sitoutumista.<br/><br/>Aseta videokamera tai kannettava tietokone web-kameralla niin, että näen mahdollisimman paljon yleisöä. Opiskelijoiden sitoutumista on vaikea arvioida, kun näen vain pari opiskelijaa.<br/><br/>Rajoita jokainen ryhmä 50 oppilaaseen. On uskomattoman vaikeaa sitouttaa suuria ryhmiä videon kautta.<br/><br/>Siirryn nopeasti aiheesta aiheeseen tai runosta runoon. Muistuta oppilaita, että heidän on kuunneltava tarkasti, jotta he ymmärtävät, mitä tapahtuu.<br/><br/>Silloin tällöin teen hieman Reader's Theater -ohjelmaa oppilaiden kanssa. Jos lähetän teille etukäteen käsikirjoitettuja opiskelijan osia, tulosta kopio JOKAiselle istunnolle ja leikkaa tarvittaessa palasiksi.<br/><br/>Vierailun aikana<br/><br/>Kun keskustelen kirjasta, jos sinulla on se painettu kirja, pidä sitä oppilaiden nähtävillä.<br/><br/>Sinä olet minun valtakirjani. En usein voi soittaa oppilaille ja kuulla yksittäisiä vastauksia. Joten saatan sanoa: "Saamme 3 ideaa. Nosta kätesi, jos sinulla on idea." Sitten SINÄ otat ohjat, kutsut kolme oppilasta ja ilmoitat nuo vastaukset kaikille huoneessa oleville ja minulle.<br/><br/>Valitse itsevarma, lähtevä opiskelija käsikirjoitetuille opiskelijaosille (jos lähetän etukäteen). Henkilökohtaisen kouluvierailuni aikana yritän vetää puoleeni joitakin vähemmän itsevarmoja oppilaita, mutta olen huomannut, että tämä ei toimi yhtä hyvin virtuaalivierailujen aikana, koska en kuule heitä.<br/><br/>Oppilaita, joilla on puhuvia osia, on istuttava eturivissä, ja kun on aika, heitä on kehotettava nousemaan ylös ja muistuttamaan, että heidän on puhuttava äänekkäästi.<br/><br/>Virtuaalivierailuilla käyttäytymisen hallinta on yksin sinun harteillasi, en useinkaan näe tarkalleen mitä tapahtuu, joten tule mukaan tarpeen mukaan. Jos tulee suuri häiriö, pyydä minua vain pitämään kiinni hetken, jotta en rupattele, kun kukaan ei kiinnitä huomiota:>)<br/><br/>Voit vapaasti ottaa kuvia minusta ruudulla ja jakaa sosiaalisessa mediassa - vaikka kuvat minusta näyttävät usein naurettavilta, koska teen hauskoja kasvoja tai jotain lukiessani!<br/><br/>Jos sinulla on kysyttävää, kysy vain, joko ennen vierailua tai sen aikana!<br/><br/>Virtuaalisen istunnon aikatauluttaminen<br/><br/>Oletko kiinnostunut varaamaan virtuaalisen vierailun kanssani? Lähetä minulle sähköpostia päivämäärän asettamiseksi, niin jatkamme siitä |

On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Uutisarkisto<br/><br/>Uusi kirja pohtii keinoja HIV-haasteisiin puuttumiseksi<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Professori Dennis Francis Marjorie Humanin kanssa, joka suunnitteli kirjan kannen, Toimii HIV: llä.<br/><br/>HIV-pandemia on tuonut esiin ihmisissä parhaat ja huonoimmat reaktiot, toisaalta se on herättänyt leimautumista ja väkivaltaa ja toisaalta se on saanut aikaan rakentavia ja tukevia reaktioita eri yksilöiltä ja ryhmiltä. Uudessa kirjassa, Acting on HIV, jonka on toimittanut professori Dennis Francis, Vapaan valtion yliopiston kasvatustieteiden tiedekunnan dekaani, tarkastellaan, miten draamaa voidaan käyttää edistämään elintärkeää sosiaalista muutosta sekä yksilöllistä käyttäytymismuutosta.<br/><br/>Hiv-toiminta tarjoaa systemaattisen tutkimuksen draamasta lähestymistapana HIV/AIDSiin ja siihen liittyviin asenteisiin ja käyttäytymiseen. Kirja on tieteellinen teksti ja sisältää noin kahdenkymmenen poikkeuksellisen luovan kirjoittajan työn. Teoksen kirjoittajia ovat muun muassa Proff. Hazel Barnes (Witwatersrandin yliopisto), Rob Pattman (Stellenboschin yliopisto) ja Yvonne Sliep KwaZulu-Natalin yliopistosta.<br/><br/>"Tämä projekti alkoi vuonna 2009 ja on vienyt suuren osan ajastani poikkeuksellisen luovien tekijöiden työn kokoamiseen. Kirjan kautta välittyvä tutkimus on omaperäinen ja ajankohtainen, ja se antaa merkittävän panoksen keskusteluihin draaman roolista/s ja merkityksestä HIV:n ja AIDSin ongelmien käsittelyssä", sanoo professori Francis. |

| Storyworld Spotlight<br/><br/>25 years of Tomb Raider<br/><br/>Tomb Raider is one of the most recognizable entertainment properties in the world. Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

Lara Croftin ensimmäisestä videopeliesiintymisestä lähtien Tomb Raiderissa (1996), hänen urotyönsä seikkailunhaluisena ja nopeaälyisenä tutkimusmatkailijana ovat resonoineet laajasti pelaajien kanssa, ansaiten hänelle paikan suurten popkulttuurihahmojen pantheonissa. Tästä syystä laitamme The World of Lara Croftin Storyworld Spotlightiin 22. joulukuuta 2021 – 6. maaliskuuta 2022.<br/><br/>Croftin valmistaminen<br/><br/>Lara Croftin loi studio Core Design, Derbyssä, Isossa-Britanniassa, vuonna 1996. Studio etsi päähahmoa heidän tulevaan 3D-seikkailupeliin PlayStation 1:lle. Peli kolmannen persoonan näkökulmasta, jossa pelaajat näkisivät päähenkilön kokonaan jokaisessa kohtauksessa.<br/><br/>Koska pelissä oli kyse "salaperäisten hautojen kaivamisesta syvälle pyramidien alle", päähenkilön täytyisi näyttää seikkailunhaluiselta, ja hänellä pitäisi olla aivot selviytyäkseen monimutkaisista ryöstöretkistä. Pienen harkinnan jälkeen syntyi Lara Croft, nuori, yläluokkainen ja täysin brittiläinen nainen, joka oli yhtä arvoituksellinen ja älykäs kuin hän oli kova ja omavarainen.<br/><br/>Menestystä ja kiistelyä<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) oli läpimurtomenestys Core Designille, joka tuplasi nopeasti Tomb Raider 2:n (1997) ja 3:n (1998) rakentamisen. Suuri osa menestyksestä johtui pelien naispääosasta, joka löysi ihailijoita sekä mies- että naispelaajista. Tämä hämmensi kriitikot, jotka näkivät juuri Lara Croftin seksistisenä sarjakuvana.<br/><br/>Tutustu Lara Croftin maailmaan Storyworldissa<br/><br/>Tämä näyttely tutkii menestyksekästä franchising-toimintaa syvällisesti.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Kiinteistöalan päivän sana: Vaihtoehto<br/><br/>Vaihtoehto: Sopimus, joka pitää avoimena tietyn ajan tarjouksen myydä tai vuokrata kiinteistöjä. Option avulla voidaan esimerkiksi antaa ostajalle aikaa ratkaista rahoitusta, omistusoikeutta, kaavoitusta ja toteutettavuutta koskevat kysymykset ennen kuin ostaja sitoutuu ostamaan. Vaihtoehtoa on tuettava sen tosiasiallisella vastikkeella, joka on erillinen ja riippumaton kiinteistön ostohinnasta. Pelkkä johdanto-osan kappale vastikkeesta ei yksin riitä, paitsi vuokrasopimuksessa, jossa vuokrasopimuksen määräykset ovat itsessään riittäviä vastiketta tukemaan optiota. Optio luo vain sopimukseen perustuvan oikeuden; se ei anna option saajalle mitään kiinteistön omaisuutta. Option allekirjoitushetkellä omistaja ei myy, eikä ostaja osta kiinteistöä. Vaikka omistaja on velvollinen myymään, jos ostaja antaa siitä ilmoituksen, ostaja ei ole velvollinen ostamaan. Osto-optiota kutsutaan myös osto-optioksi; myyntioptiota kutsutaan myyntioptioksi. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Karotenoidien hyödyt iholle<br/><br/>Nämä voimakkaat fytokemikaalit ovat kasveissa esiintyviä pigmentoituneita ainesosia, jotka antavat kukkia, hedelmiä ja jättävät keltaiset, oranssit ja punaiset värinsä.<br/><br/>1930-luvulta lähtien tutkijat ovat tunnistaneet noin 800 karotenoidia ja noin 40 löytyy ihmiskehosta, mukaan lukien orvaskeden uloin kerros, dermis ja ihonalainen rasva. Yleisimmät karotenoidit ovat beetakaroteenia, alfakaroteenia, luteiinia, zeaksantiinia, lykopeenia ja astaksantiinia. Voit lukea lisää astaksantiinista täältä.<br/><br/>Ihon karotenoidipitoisuuteen vaikuttavat lukuisat tekijät, kuten hedelmien ja vihannesten saanti, niiden hyötyosuus eri elintarvikkeista, täydentäminen, altistuminen UV-säteilylle, ilmansaasteet, alkoholin kulutus, tupakointi ja stressi.<br/><br/>Miten karotenoidit auttavat ihoani?<br/><br/>Karotenoidit ovat ihon tunnetuimpia antioksidantteja, ja niillä on myös tärkeitä tehtäviä tulehduskipulääkkeinä.<br/><br/>Terveellinen ikääntyminen ja ihon korjaus<br/><br/>Antioksidantit ovat välttämättömiä terveelle iholle, koska ne auttavat estämään vapaiden radikaalien vaurioita soluille. Vapaat radikaalit vauriot aiheuttavat ennenaikaista vanhenemista ja erilaisten ihosyöpien puhkeamista. Karotenoidit yhdessä E-vitamiinin, C-vitamiinin ja Co-entsyymi Q10:n kanssa ovat tärkeitä ihon antioksidantteja.<br/><br/>Antioksidanttivaikutuksensa ansiosta karotenoidit tukevat ja edistävät kollageenin ja elastiinin tuotantoa ihossa. Tämä auttaa lisäämään ihon tiheyttä, paksuutta, kimmoisuutta ja kiinteyttä. Kollageeni ja elastiini vähenevät ikääntyessä, joten tarpeeksi karotenoidien saaminen ruokavaliosta ja paikallisesti on kriittistä ikääntymiselle hyvin.<br/><br/>Karotenoidit voivat parantaa ikääntymisen merkkejä, ihon värimuutoksia, kimmoisuutta, nesteytystä, tekstuuria ja vähentää transepidermaalista vedenhukkaa.<br/><br/>Erityisesti astaksantiini stimuloi fibroblasteja tuottamaan kollageenia ja elastiinia, estää kollageenin ja elastiinin hajoavien entsyymien toimintaa ja osoittaa anti-inflammatorisia ja UV-suodattavia vaikutuksia. Sen on osoitettu vähentävän ihon melaniinia, mikä johtaa pisamien ja melasman ulkonäön vähenemiseen.<br/><br/>Aknevastainen vaikutus: karotenoidien anti-inflammatorinen vaikutus auttaa vaimentamaan akneen liittyvää tulehdusta ja ärsytystä. Karotenoidit auttavat myös normalisoimaan ja tasapainottamaan öljyn eritteitä talirauhasista. Ne ovat arvokkaita aineita ihon korjaamisessa ja stimuloivat epidermaalista uudistumista, mikä auttaa tasoittamaan ja pehmentämään ihoa.<br/><br/>Mistä löydän karotenoidit?<br/><br/>Karotenoidien päivittäisen annoksen saa kahdella tavalla: ruokavalion kautta ja paikallisesti. Molempien yhdistelmä on ihanteellinen lähestymistapa hyvin ikääntyvään ihonhoitoon.<br/><br/>Karotenoidit ovat rasvaliukoisia, joten elimistö tarvitsee rasvaa niiden imeytymiseen (ajattele tomaatteja ja oliiviöljyä, parsakaalia ja voita tai pinaattia ja avokadoa). Yleisiä karotenoidien lähteitä ruoassa ovat avokado, munankeltuainen, lehtikaali, pinaatti, porkkanat, bataatit, papaija ja tomaatit.<br/><br/>Vaikka kannatamme mahdollisimman monien ravintoaineiden ja antioksidanttien hankkimista ruoasta täydentämisen sijaan; yksi tutkimus osoitti, että astaksantiini yhdistettynä kollageenihydrolysaattiin paransi merkittävästi esteen eheyttä, vähensi transepidermaalista vesihävikkiä ja lisäsi prokollageenin tyypin I mRNA: n ilmentymistä.<br/><br/>Ajankohtainen käyttö on avain terveeseen ihoon. Tutkimukset osoittavat, että suuret antioksidanttipitoisuudet ihmisen ihossa tarjoavat parhaan suojan terveelle iholle missä tahansa iässä.<br/><br/>Sarka Botanicalsissa sekoitetaan karotenoidirikkaita kokonaisia kasveja, kuten kehäkukkaa, voikukkaa ja astaksantiinin kaltaisia uutteita kylmäpuristettuihin öljyihin ja toiminnallisiin ainesosiin. Calendula sisältää yksin yli 19 erilaista karotenoidityyppiä. Tämä saattaa selittää sen, miksi sillä on niin pitkä käyttöhistoria ihonhoidossa. Tutkimukset osoittavat, että koentsyymi Q10:een sekoitetut karotenoidit ovat erityisen tehokkaita vähentämään tulehdusta ja hidastamaan ihon ennenaikaista vanhenemista auringolle altistumisen vuoksi. |
