Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Postinavigointi<br/><br/>"Life Without Papers" voitti parhaan käsikirjoituksen palkinnon<br/><br/>Len Grantin luomassa blogiprojektissa "Life Without Papers" kerrotaan tarinoita paperittomista siirtolaisperheistä ja nuorista. Paperittomilla siirtolaisilla ei ole mitään. He eivät saa tehdä työtä. Heillä ei ole oikeutta valtion etuuksiin eikä asuinpaikkaan. He ovat näkymättömiä ja potentiaalisesti haavoittuvin ryhmä Yhdistyneessä kuningaskunnassa nykyään.<br/><br/>Paperittomia (tai laittomia) muuttajia ovat seksikauppaan tai kotimaan maaorjuuteen joutuneet henkilöt; heihin kuuluvat viisumin voimassaoloajan ylittäneet henkilöt; ne, joiden turvapaikkahakemukset on hylätty ja muut, jotka ovat joutuneet maahanmuuttojärjestelmän epäonnistumisten kohteeksi. Kaikki nämä ovat saattaneet alun perin tulla Yhdistyneeseen kuningaskuntaan laillisesti.<br/><br/>"Laittomat maahanmuuttajat" – ne, joiden kuvitellaan tulleen maahan kuorma-autojen selustassa – muodostavat pienen osan paperittomista.<br/><br/>Itse asiassa jotkut lähteet viittaavat siihen, että puolet Yhdistyneessä kuningaskunnassa arvioiduista 120 000 paperittomasta lapsesta syntyivät täällä paperittomille vanhemmille. Nämä lapset ovat epäedullisessa asemassa syntymästä lähtien, pelkästään heidän maahanmuuttoasemansa vuoksi.<br/><br/>Blogi kertoo paperittomien tarinoita. Se korostaa heidän päivittäisiä kamppailujaan ja haavoittuvuuksiaan, mutta myös heidän vahvuuttaan ja sinnikkyyttään. Se ei ole helppoa luettavaa.<br/><br/>Blogiin pääsee käsiksi nettisivujemme kautta (alhaalla oikeanpuoleinen sarake kotisivulla).<br/><br/>Blogi on voittanut Speaking Together -mediapalkintojen verkkokategorian. Palkinnot olivat tänä vuonna uusi lisäys vuoden maahanmuuttaja- ja pakolaisnaisen palkintojuhlaan Lontoon Royal Festival Hallissa osana kansainvälistä naistenpäivää. Tuomaristo – mukaan lukien kirjailija ja näytelmäkirjailija Gillian Slovo sekä toimittaja ja kirjailija Hannah Pool – etsi erityisesti työtä, joka haastoi myyttejä ja stereotypioita.<br/><br/>Blogi on voittanut myös Blog North Awards 2013 -palkinnon parhaan kirjoittamisen kategoriassa ja oli myös ehdolla Amnesty Internationalin mediapalkinnon saajaksi. |
| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Sapattikoulun oppitunti<br/><br/>Galatalaiskirjeessä Paavali käsittelee sellaisia kysymyksiä kuin vapaus, lain merkitys pelastuksessa, tilamme Kristuksessa ja Hengen johtaman elämän luonne sekä ikivanha kysymys: Miten syntiset ihmiset voidaan tehdä oikein pyhän ja oikeudenmukaisen Jumalan edessä?<br/><br/>Monet tutkijat uskovat, että Galatalaiskirje saattaa olla varhaisin Paavalin kirjeistä. Se kirjoitettiin vuonna 49 jKr., pian kuuluisan Jerusalemin kirkolliskokouksen (Ap.t. 15) jälkeen. Siksi kirja saattaa olla vanhin tunnettu kristillinen asiakirja. Kuten Apostolien teot ja Galatalaiskirje tekevät selväksi, alkuseurakunta joutui kiivaaseen taisteluun pelastuksen luonteesta, erityisesti pakanoiden tapauksessa. Juutalaisina tunnettujen juutalaisuskovien ryhmän mukaan usko Jeesukseen yksin ei kelvannut pakanoille. Pakanat on myös ympärileikattava ja heidän on noudatettava Mooseksen lakeja (Ap. t. 15:1).<br/><br/>Tämän neljänneksen raamatuntutkisteluopas kutsuu meidät matkalle apostoli Paavalin kanssa, kun hän anoo galatalaisia pysymään uskollisina Jeesukselle. Se antaa meille myös mahdollisuuden pohtia omaa ymmärrystämme totuuksista, jotka avasivat tien Martin Lutherin lopulliselle välirikolle Rooman kanssa ja raamatullisen evankeliumin palauttamiselle. |

Pian sen jälkeen, kun Kaarle oli jäänyt leskeksi joksikin aikaa joulukuussa 1785, hän pyysi lupaa jäädä eläkkeelle sotilastehtävistään Hannoverissa.

Franz Frederick Karl Ludwig Georg Heinrich, Frederick Wilhelm Karl Joseph Ludwig Georg. Frederickiä pidettiin suosittuna ja älykkäänä, hänen valtakaudellaan, yhdessä kauniin vaimonsa Charlotten kanssa, kulttuurielämä pikkukaupungissa saavutti huippunsa. Niin monet runoilijat ja taiteilijat viettivät siellä aikaansa, että Hildburghausen sai lempinimen Klein-Weimar, kun Saxe-Gotha-Altenburgin viimeinen herttua kuoli ilman kysymystä vuonna 1825, muut talon haarat päättivät Ernestine-herttuakuntien uudelleenjärjestelystä. Frederickistä tuli 12. marraskuuta 1826 Saxe-Altenburgin herttua, jolle hän antoi vuonna 1831 vaihdossa ensimmäisen peruslain, joka liittyi Frederickiin, Saxe-Altenburgin herttuaan Wikimedia Commonsissa geneall. net.<br/><br/>Frederick, Saxe-Altenburgin herttua<br/>–<br/>Frederick<br/><br/>15.<br/>Mecklenburg-Strelitzin herttuatar Charlotte Georgine<br/>–<br/>Charlotte Georgine syntyi Hannoverissa, Brunswickin vaalipiirissä. Hän oli Mecklenburgin suurherttuan Kaarle II:n, Charlotten ja hänen sisartensa, Preussin kuningatar Louisen, Hannoverin kuningatar Frederican ja Thurn und Taxisin prinsessa Theresen vanhin lapsi ja tytärtä pidettiin aikansa kauneimpana naisena. Jean Paul Friedrich Richter omisti romaaninsa Titan neljälle kauniille, Charlotte varttui Hannoverissa, jossa hänen isänsä toimi kuvernöörinä Lontoossa asuneen lankonsa, Yhdistyneen kuningaskunnan kuninkaan Yrjö III:n puolesta. Kun Charlotte oli kaksitoista vuotta vanha, hänen äitinsä kuoli ja hän oli tuonut esille hänen äitinsä sisko, Charlotte, joka avioitui hänen isänsä vuonna 1784 ja hänen sisarensa olivat tuoneet hänen isoäitinsä, Maria Louise Albertine, Leiningen-Falkenburg-Dagsburg, Darmstadt. Charlotte oli sitten muuttanut Hildburghauseniin. 3. syyskuuta 1785, viidentoista vuoden ikäisenä, Charlotte meni naimisiin herttua Frederickin, Saxe-Altenburgin herttuan kanssa, avioliitto ei ollut onnellinen, Charlotte oli henkisesti ylivoimainen Frederickiin nähden, joka alkoi jättää hänet huomiotta. Heillä oli myös ongelmia, Saxe-Hildburghausen oli taloudellisesti pilalla Fredericksin edeltäjien katastrofaalisen politiikan vuoksi. Pesänhoitajat sallivat herttualle ja herttuattarelle vain alennetun siviililistan, Charlotten isä ja kaksi veljeä jäivät usein Charlotten luokse Hildburghauseniin. Vuonna 1787 hän muutti Hildburghauseniin pysyvästi, ja hänestä tuli luottokomitean puheenjohtaja. Vuonna 1792 Charlotten isoäiti ja hänen sisarensa pakenivat ennen etenevää Ranskan armeijaa Darmstadtista Hildburghauseniin ja hänen isoäitinsä huomasi Charlotten aviomiehen. Kaikista velvollisuuksistaan hän täyttää aviolliset velvollisuutensa innokkaasti. Charlotte, joka ei koskaan rakastanut tätä miestä, on aina raskaana, perhe vietti useita huolettomia viikkoja Hildburghausenissa. Vuonna 1793 Charlotten isoäiti palasi maanpaosta ja matkusti Charlotten sisarten kanssa Frankfurt am Mainiin, Charlottella oli hyvin intiimi ja rakastava suhde sisarensa Friederiken ja sukulaistensa kanssa Strelitzissä. Vuosina 1803 ja 1805 Preussin kuningaspari vieraili Hildburghausenissa, tätä tilaisuutta varten vastaanottajat antoivat herttuaparin uudistaa osan huonekaluistaan. Louise oli auttanut sodanjulistuksen laatimisessa, Christian Truchse – von Wetzhausen zu Bettenburg oli herttuaparin ystävä ja Charlotten pojan Edwardin kummisetä. Monet katsojat olivat tulleet katsomaan Baijerin kruununprinsessaa, kun hän vastaanotti vieraitaan, Truchse – yritti johtaa alempiarvoisen Charlotten ensin linnaansa, mutta tämä kieltäytyi viitaten tyttäreensä. Truchsei vastasi: "Teidän korkeutenne antaa minulle anteeksi, mutta niin kauan kuin tämä linna on seissyt tässä, Therese tarttui sitten paronien toiseen käteen, ja kolme heistä kävelivät portista yhdessä.<br/><br/>1617.<br/>Hesse-Kasselin prinssi Charles<br/>–<br/>Hesse-Kasselin prinssi Charles oli Hesse-Kasselin talon kadettijäsen ja tanskalainen kenraalisotamarsalkka. Toipuessaan sukulaistensa kanssa Tanskan hovissa hän vietti suurimman osan elämästään Tanskassa ja hänen äitinsä oli Ison-Britannian kuningas Yrjö II:n ja Ansbachin Carolinen tytär sekä Tanskan kuningatar Louisen sisar. Hänen isänsä, tuleva maahauta, jätti perheen vuonna 1747, vuonna 1755 hän virallisesti lopetti avioliiton Marian kanssa. Isoisä Vilhelm VIII, Hessenin Landgrave, myönsi Hanaun kreivikunnalle ja sen tuloille Marialle, nuorelle prinssi Charlesille ja hänen kahdelle veljelleen Vilhelmille ja Frederickille, heidän äitinsä kasvatti ja protestanttiset sukulaiset kasvattivat heitä vuodesta 1747 lähtien. Vuonna 1756 Maria muutti Tanskaan hoitamaan sisarensa, Tanskan kuningatar Louisen, alaikäisiä lapsia ja otti mukaansa poikansa, jotka kasvatettiin Christiansborgin palatsin hovissa Kööpenhaminassa. Hessenin ruhtinaat jäivät myöhemmin Tanskaan, ja heistä tuli sen tärkeitä herroja, ja vain vanhin veli Vilhelm palasi Hesseen vuonna 1785 noustuaan maagraviaatiksi. Kaarle aloitti uran Tanskassa. Vuonna 1758 hänet nimitettiin everstiksi, 20-vuotiaana kenraalimajuriksi, myös vuonna 1766, hänet nimitettiin Norjan kenraalikuvernööriksi, missä virassa hän toimi vuoteen 1768 saakka, mutta joka pysyi enimmäkseen titulaarina, sillä hän ei koskaan tänä aikana käynyt Norjassa. Vuonna 1763 hänen vanhempi veljensä Vilhelm nai heidän serkkunsa, Kaarle seurasi perässä 30. elokuuta 1766 Christiansborgin palatsissa – hänen vaimonsa oli Tanskan Louise, ja Kaarlesta tuli näin serkkunsa, kuningas Kristian VII:n lanko. Avioliitto solmittiin huolimatta sitä vastaan annetuista neuvoista, johtuen prinssi Charlesin syytöksistä irstailusta. Pian tämän jälkeen Kaarle joutui hovissa epäsuosioon, ja alkuvuodesta 1767 hän ja he saisivat ensimmäisen lapsensa Marie Sophien sinne vuonna 1767 ja sitten toisen lapsensa Williamin vuonna 1769. Vuonna 1768 Kaarle osti Offenbach-Rumpenheimin kiinteistön ja kylän Edelsheimin suvulta. Vuonna 1771 hän laajensi kartanon linnaksi ja ruhtinasistuimeksi ja hänen äitinsä Maria asui palatsissa kuolemaansa asti vuonna 1772. Vuonna 1781 Kaarle myi Rumpenheimin palatsin nuoremmalle veljelleen, Charles asettui perheensä kanssa asumaan Gottorpin linnaan Schleswigiin. He saisivat siellä kolmannen lapsensa Frederickin vuonna 1771, vuonna 1770 kuningas Kristian VII antoi sisarelleen Tegelhofin tilan Göbyssä Schleswigin kaupungin ja Eckernförden välillä. Kaarlella oli vuodesta 1772 vuoteen 1776 paikalle rakennettu kesäasunto, jonka hän nimesi vaimonsa kunniaksi Louisenlundiksi, syyskuussa 1772 Kaarle nimitettiin Norjan armeijan ylipäälliköksi ja hän ja Louise muuttivat Christianaan. Määräys oli seurausta Ruotsin kuninkaan Kustaa III:n vallankaappauksesta 19. elokuuta 1772, kun taas Norjassa prinsessa Louise synnytti heidän neljännen lapsensa Julianen vuonna 1773.<br/><br/>18.<br/>Louise Caroline Hesse-Kasselista<br/>–<br/>Louise Caroline syntyi Gottorpissa Schleswigin herttuakunnassa Landgrave Charles of Hesse-Kasselille ja hänen vaimolleen Tanskan prinsessa Louiselle.

Häntä pidetään Casa dEsten perustajana, koska hän oli ollut Esten mestarina olleen ensimmäisen perheen pää, Alberto Azzo II oli Milanon Margraven Albert Azzo I:n ainoa poika. Hän peri isiensä toimistot noin vuonna 1020 ja kartutti jatkuvasti kiinteistöjään Pohjois-Italiassa, vuosina 1069-1070 hän yritti hankkia Mainen pojalleen Hugh'lle, koska hänen vaimonsa Garsende oli edellisten Mainen kreivikuntien perijätär. Hugh julistettiin kreiviksi, mutta hän ei voinut voittaa Robertia, Normandian herttuaa, Pyhän saksalais-roomalaisen keisarikunnan keisarin Henrik IV:n ja paavi Gregorius VII:n välisessä Investituurariidassa, Azzo yritti toimia välittäjänä, mutta myöhemmin hän liittyi paavin puolelle. Vuoden 1073 tienoilla hän teki Esteen linnasta asuinpaikkansa, josta Esten talo, ennen rakennushankettaan, Este oli vain vähän enemmän kuin kylä. Hänen poikansa Welf muutti ensin Kärnteniin ja sitten Baijeriin, jolloin syntyi yksi Euroopan historian tärkeimmistä perheistä, toinen poika, Milanon Fulk I, käytti ensimmäistä dokumentoitua nimitystä markiisi dEste. Azzo II avioitui Welf II:n tyttären, Altdorfin kreivin, kanssa ja heillä oli yksi tunnettu lapsi, Welf Baijerin herttua vuosina 1070-1077 ja vuodesta 1096 kuolemaansa saakka, joka oli ensimmäinen jäsen Esten suvun Welf-haarassa. Hänen toinen avioliittonsa oli Garsenden kanssa, joka oli Herbert I:n, Mainen kreivin tytär ja heillä oli seuraavat tunnetut pojat, Fulco I, Milanon Margrave, Esten suvun italialaisen haaran esi-isä Hugh V:llä, Mainen kreivillä, ei ollut mitään ongelmaa. Joidenkin lähteiden mukaan hän meni myös naimisiin Pietari Orseolon tyttären Vitalia Orseolon kanssa ja hänellä oli avioliiton ulkopuolinen suhde Williamin sisaren, Padovan piispan Matildan kanssa, jonka kanssa hänellä oli tytär nimeltä Adelasia, joka meni naimisiin Guglielmo Adelardin kanssa.

Hän oli ensimmäinen jäsen Esten suvun Welf-haarassa, Welfin vanhemman suvun sukuluettelossa hänet lasketaan Welf IV:ksi. Welf oli Esten Azzo II:n ja hänen vaimonsa Altdorfin Kunigunden poika, kun Welfin eno, Kärntenin herttua Welf kuoli lapsettomana, Welf peri hänen omaisuutensa. Welf nai Northeimin Ethelinden, Baijerin herttua Otto II:n tyttären, kun hänen appensa, herttua Otto oli tullut kuningas Henrik IV:n viholliseksi ja menettänyt herttuakuntansa, Welf pysyi uskollisena kuninkaalle. Henrikin käskyjen mukaisesti hän torjui ja erosi herttuattarestaan Ethelindestä ja tämä tapahtuma järjestettiin Goslarissa vuonna 1070, jolloin Baijerin osavaltiot alistuivat vaivihkaa vastavalmistuneelle herttuakunnalle, joka edusti yhtä maakunnan vanhimmista suvuista. Hän torjui herttuattaren, jota olisi voinut pitää epäoikeudenmukaisena tekona. Paavi ja keisari sovitettiin pinnallisesti vuonna 1076, mutta samana vuonna he ryhtyivät jälleen aktiivisiin vihollisuuksiin. Toistuvien kapinoiden seurauksena Henrik julisti Welfin syrjäytetyksi vastahankitussa herttuakunnassaan. Uskollisten baijerilaistensa tukemana ja isänsä avustamana Welf pystyi kuitenkin säilyttämään paikkansa, Gregorius kuoli kuitenkin vuonna 1085 ja hänen seuraajansa ottivat vähemmän intensiivistä osaa Saksan asioihin. Vaikka Welf yhä pitäytyi kirkon juhlissa, niin avioeron jälkeen vuonna 1070 Welf meni ensimmäisestä vaimostaan naimisiin Judith Flanderilaisen kanssa, joka oli Baldwin IV:n tytär, Flanderin kreivi, ja Northumbrian jaarlin Tostig Godwinsonin leski. Welfsin poika Welf avioitui vuonna 1089 Toscanan Matildan kanssa vahvistaen siten suhteita paaviin, mutta sen jälkeen kun nuorempi Welf erosi Matildasta vuonna 1095, Welf teki sovinnon kuningas Henrik IV:n kanssa ja hänet vahvistettiin uudelleen asemassaan Baijerin herttuana. Isänsä Azzon kuoltua vuonna 1097 Welf yritti hankkia isilleen omaisuutta Alppien eteläpuolella, vuonna 1099 Welf liittyi siihen, mikä tulisi tunnetuksi vuoden 1101 ristiretkenä, yhdessä Akvitanian Vilhelm IX:n, Vermandois'n Hughin ja Itävallan Idan kanssa. Hänen suurin menestyksensä oli estää yhteenotto muiden ristiretkeläisten välillä, jotka olivat ryöstäneet Bysantin aluetta matkalla Konstantinopoliin, Welf itse pakeni fiaskoa, mutta kuoli matkalla takaisin Pafoksella Kyproksella vuonna 1101 ja haudattiin Weingartenin luostariin.

Henrik oli Baijerin herttua Welf I:n poika hänen avioliitostaan Judithin kanssa. Nuorena miehenä hän hallinnoi Esten sukujen omaisuutta Alppien eteläpuolella, avioliiton kautta Wulfhildeen, Saksin herttua Magnusin tyttären, noin vuonna 1095, hän hankki osan Billungin maa-alueista Löneburgin ympäriltä. Hän pyrki appensa seuraajaksi Saksin herttuana, kun Magnus kuoli ilman perillisiä vuonna 1106. Herttua Henrik piti kuitenkin yllä läheisiä suhteita hallitsevaan Salian-dynastiaan, ja vuonna 1116 hän liittyi keisari Henrik V:n toiseen Italian sotaretkeen, jonka tarkoituksena oli anastaa Toscanan edesmenneen Margravine Matildan säädyt. Hän seurasi vanhemman veljensä Welf II:n seuraajaa Baijerin herttuana, kun jälkimmäinen kuoli lapsettomana vuonna 1120, Henrik oli myös tärkeässä asemassa Wormsin vuoden 1122 konkordaatin aikaansaamisessa, mikä päätti paavin ja keisarin välisen pitkäaikaisen Investituurariidan. Avioliitto solmittiin toukokuussa 1127, vieraantuminen Welfin ja Hohenstaufenin dynastioiden välillä kesti 1200-luvulle saakka. Lothairin voitettua vaalit hän kuitenkin asetti keisarillisen kiellon Fredrik II:lle.

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Seuraa meitä<br/><br/>OLETKO SINÄ<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Tässä on mitä kehosi yrittää kertoa<br/><br/>mukaan<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>KUVA:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Painonnousu hallitsemattomista mielihaluista syrjään, voi olla turhauttavaa olla jatkuva kaipuu jotain epäterveellistä eikä tiedä miksi. Hyvä uutinen on, että taustalla on yleensä syy, että palava halu talo pussi perunalastuja, tai tunne, että saatat todella kuolla, jos et saa suolakurkkua rightthisinstant (vaikka et ole raskaana). Jos saat näkyjä esimerkiksi Linnunradan baareista, se voi tarkoittaa, että ruokavaliostasi puuttuu hyvin erityinen ravintoaine. (Jup – se on monimutkaisempaa kuin sanoi suklaapatukka on niin pirun herkullista.)<br/><br/>Puhuimme Los Angelesissa asuvan ravitsemusterapeutin Shira Lenchewskin, M.S., R.D., kanssa, jotta saisimme laihan joitakin yleisiä ruoanhimoja, sekä mitä voit tehdä nälän tyydyttämiseksi menemättä yli laidan.<br/><br/>Jos himoitset suklaata<br/><br/>Se tarkoittaa: Ruokavaliosta voi puuttua magnesiumia, Lenchewski sanoo. "Magnesium on välttämätön mineraali, joka osallistuu energiantuotantoon, glukoosiaineenvaihduntaan ja lihasten toimintaan. Tämä pätee erityisesti kuntosalille kovaa lyöviin", hän selittää. Lisäksi magnesiumin tasot laskevat kuukautisia edeltävinä viikkoina, mikä selittää sen, miksi PMS:n mukana tulee niin usein suklaanhimoa.<br/><br/>Sen sijaan tavoitellaan korkealaatuista, vähäsokerista tummaa suklaata, jossa on luonnostaan paljon magnesiumia. "Suosittelen tarttumaan 75-prosenttiseen kaakaoon tai sitä korkeampaan ja parittamaan sen toiseen magnesiumpitoiseen lähteeseen, kuten auringonkukansiemeniin", Lenchewski sanoo. Hän ehdottaa suklaabrändiä Hu, pienieräinen elintarvikeyritys, joka keskittyy paikallisesti tuotettuihin korkealaatuisiin ainesosiin. "Se on hieman tyyris, mutta sitä suurempi syy pitää annokset kurissa", hän sanoo. "Se on henkilökohtainen suosikkini." Olemme myös suuria superfood-pakattujen Zenbunnin faneja.<br/><br/>Jos himoitset karkkia<br/><br/>Se tarkoittaa: "Puhdas sokeri on hyvä osoitus siitä, että energiasi on vähissä", Lenchewski sanoo. "Mieti sitä. Mikä on yksi asia, jota kutittaa kauhean yöunen jälkeen tai noin kello 16: n aikana stressaavan työpäivän aikana? Vastaus on yleensä sokeri, koska sitä käytetään kehomme solujen välittömänä polttoaineena."<br/><br/>Kurkota sen sijaan omenoita pähkinävoilla. "Jos ryöstät työtovereidesi karkkikätköjä, suosittelen hitaampaa hiilihydraattia, jossa on rasva- tai proteiinilähde", Lenchewski sanoo. "Toisin kuin yksinkertainen sokeri, tämä polttaa soluja välttäen samalla sokerin jälkeisen kaatumisen. Kaksi vaihtoehtoa, jotka tekevät suuren poiminta seuraavan kerran, kun himoitset karkkia: viipaloitu omena valitsemallasi pähkinävoilla tai marjat, joissa on 2 % makeuttamatonta kreikkalaista jogurttia." Pidämme makean hampaan murskaamisesta myös näillä riippuvuutta aiheuttavilla kookoslastuilla – ne ovat täyteisiä, niissä ei ole lisättyä sokeria, ja vain niin hyviä.<br/><br/>Jos himoitset suolaa<br/><br/>Se tarkoittaa: "Jos vain suolaisin suolakurkku kelpaa, et ehkä juo tarpeeksi H2O:ta", Lenchewski sanoo. "Suola auttaa elimistöä pitämään kiinni vedestä, joten himoitsemme sitä, kun tarvitsemme nesteitä."<br/><br/>Sen sijaan tavoitella vettä. "Pysyä sammutettua, varsinkin kun lähestymme kesäkuukausina", hän sanoo. Seuraavan kerran himo osuu, kokeile sammuttaa se (kirjaimellisesti) muutamalla virkistävä lasit ja saatat löytää kiireellisyys natrium ahmiminen katoaa. "Jos tavallinen vesi kyllästyttää, kokeile lisätä siihen minttua, sitruunaa tai pakastettuja hedelmiä", Lenchewski sanoo. Ja jos se ei vieläkään tee temppua, on terveellisempi vaihtoehto pussitettuihin siruihin tai ranskalaisiin. "Jos todella vain himoitset suolaa, paahdettu merilevä on suuri vähäkalorinen vaihtoehto", hän sanoo.<br/><br/>Jos kaipaat tärkkelyspitoisia hiilihydraatteja kuten pastaa<br/><br/>Se tarkoittaa: "Koska korkeahiilihydraattiset elintarvikkeet lisäävät hyvän olon hormonia serotoniinia, tärkkelyksenhimo voi olla merkki siitä, että tarvitset mielialan tehostajaa", Lenchewski sanoo.<br/><br/>Sen sijaan, kurota kylpyyn! "Bust ulos Epsom suoloja, koska se on aika joitakin vakavia R + R", sanoo Lenchewski. "Luota minuun. Antautuminen tärkkelystä vapaasti kaikille tuntuu todella hyvältä tällä hetkellä, mutta se todennäköisesti bum sinua ulos enemmän seuraavana päivänä." (Kuten kuka tahansa pizzan tai pastan himon yliherkkä tietää.) Joten seuraavan kerran kun haluat sukeltaa pää edellä hiilihydraattiin, vedä kylpy, sytytä kynttilä ja hemmottele itseäsi ilman katumusta tai tiheitä kaloreita.<br/><br/>Jos kaipaat jäätelöä<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>Se tarkoittaa: "Kehosi saattaa kertoa, että se tarvitsee tervettä rasvaa."<br/><br/>Sen sijaan tavoitellaan kookosjäätelöä. "Olen realisti, joten jos himoitset jäätelöä, en aio suositella kourallista saksanpähkinöitä, jotka ovat tietenkin täynnä terveellistä rasvaa", Lenchewski sanoo. "Jäätelöhätätilanteisiin suosittelen matalamman sokerin kookosjäätelöitä kuten Coconut Bliss tai Kippyn kolmen ainesosan jäätelöä Los Angelesissa." Voimme taata, että kookosjäätelö maistuu uskomattomalta ja aivan oikealta.<br/><br/>Jos himoitset hampurilaista<br/><br/>Se tarkoittaa: Tarvitset rautaa. "Jos et voi lakata ajattelemasta punaista lihaa, on mahdollista, että kehosi himoitsee rautaa, b12:ta ja foolihappoa", Lenchewski sanoo. "Tämä pätee erityisesti siihen aikaan kuukaudesta."<br/><br/>Sen sijaan tavoitellaan terveellisempää hampurilaista. "Olen ruohonsyötön, antibioottisen ja hormonittoman punaisen lihan kannattaja kerran viikossa", Lenchewski sanoo. "Kokeile kokeilla avonaista biisonihampurilaista - joka leikattuna on kevyempi ja siinä on enemmän rautaa kuin naudanlihaa." Älä syö lihaa? Yritä sisällyttää jonkinlainen kasvipohjainen rautalisä rutiiniisi, kuten spirulina. |

Spoiler alert: This brain teaser is entirely solvable. Scroll down to read the puzzle, and to get the answer. Good luck!<br/><br/>Here's The Puzzle<br/><br/>Alice and Bob are each told a number, but neither knows the other's number. Both of the numbers are positive and consecutive. In the room with Alice and Bob, there is a clock that dings every minute. Someone can guess the other's number only at the ding of that clock, but they can also remain silent. If someone correctly guesses the other's number on the first try, both people $1 million.<br/><br/>There is a way to win without any form of communication between Alice and Bob, and, duh, without cheating. It's completely logical and can guarantee a win on the first try. How can they do it? Watch the video below to find out.<br/><br/>The Seemingly Impossible Guess The Number Puzzle<br/><br/>Share the knowledge!<br/><br/>Here's The Answer<br/><br/>Suppose Alice is told the number N. She hears the clock ding N-1 times, so she knows that Bob was told N+1. Therefore, on the next ding, she can correctly guess Bob's secret number. If we're dealing with small numbers, however, it can be played differently. If Alice was told 1, she knows Bob was told 2 because 0 is not a positive (or negative) number.

Huoneessa Alicen ja Bobin kanssa on kello, joka soi joka minuutti. Joku voi arvata toisen numeron vain kyseisen kellon dingissä, mutta he voivat myös olla hiljaa. Jos joku arvaa toisen numeron oikein ensimmäisellä yrittämällä, molemmat ihmiset miljoona dollaria.<br/><br/>On olemassa tapa voittaa ilman minkäänlaista viestintää Alicen ja Bobin välillä, ja, duh, huijaamatta.

Katso alla oleva video selvittääksesi.<br/><br/>Näennäisen mahdoton arvaus Lukupulmapeli<br/><br/>Jaa tietoa!<br/><br/>Tässä on vastaus<br/><br/>Oletetaan, että Alicelle kerrotaan numero N. Hän kuulee kellon ding N-1 kertaa, joten hän tietää, että Bobille kerrottiin N+1. Siksi seuraavalla dingillä hän osaa arvata oikein Bobin salaisen numeron. Jos kyseessä ovat pienet numerot, sitä voidaan kuitenkin soittaa eri tavalla. Jos Alicelle kerrottiin 1, hän tietää, että Bobille kerrottiin 2, koska 0 ei ole positiivinen (tai negatiivinen) luku.

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India.

He is also an avid writer and some of his commended work have been published on renowned websites | Verkkopalvelut, myyjät ja kyberlait!<br/><br/>Päivitetty: 21. huhtikuuta 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Tämän maailman tietokoneistaminen muutti ihmisen suorituskykyskenaariota suuressa määrin ja sekin on mittaamatonta. Esimerkiksi Nyt voit lähettää elintärkeää tietoa ympäri maailmaa yhdellä hiiren klikkauksella internet-yhteyden ansiosta. Valitettavasti juuri tämä laaja liitettävyys ja suosio ihmisten keskuudessa, internet on myös lisännyt mahdollisuuksia tietokonerikoksiin. Internet-rikokset tai tietokonerikokset tunnetaan laajalti "kyberrikoksina".<br/><br/>Kyberlait on oikeuslaitoksessa jotain uutta, mutta se on saanut paljon huomiota viime aikoina. Termi kyberrikollisuus on jotain hyvin synonyymi tavanomaiselle rikollisuudelle, ainoa ero on teloituksen medium. Kyberrikoksia on pääasiassa kahdenlaisia, joista ensimmäinen on se, missä tietokoneet ovat pääkohteita ja näitä ovat muun muassa tietovahingot, haittakoodit ja jopa rikollisten tietojen käyttö. Toinen on se, että tietokone on vain työkalu, jolla tavanomaisia rikoksia tehdään esimerkiksi kyberterrorismiin, roskapostitukseen, verkkovakoiluun ja moniin muihin tarkoituksiin.<br/><br/>Tässä kohtaa paikalle tulee verkkosivustokonsultti tai -myyjä. Vaikka et ole tietoinen kaikista tähän mennessä voimassa olevista kyberlaeista, verkkosivustojen myyjä voi neuvoa sinua joistakin tärkeimmistä kyberlaeista luodessaan sivustoasi.<br/><br/>Tämä voi sisältää yleistä tietämystä kopiointioikeuksista tai jopa oman verkkosivuston sisällön suojaamisesta. Kaikkien oikeuksien selittäminen, joita sinulla on verkkosivuston omistajana, on myös yksi tehtävistä, joita verkkosivuston myyjä voi tehdä kehittäessään verkkosivustoasi. Myyjä voi myös auttaa sinua tarjoamalla tietoa erilaisista kyberlaeista tietojen suojaamiseksi. Kaiken tämän lisäksi myyjä voi myös tarjota sinulle tietoa mistä tahansa uudesta kyberlaista, josta et välttämättä ole tietoinen ennen kuin tiedät. Kyberlait voivat vaihdella maasta toiseen, yksi viimeaikainen esimerkki voi olla Yhdistyneessä kuningaskunnassa julkaistu evästelaki, joka estää verkkosivustoa tallentamasta käyttäjien selaustietoja. Evästelain mukaan Yhdistyneen kuningaskunnan verkkosivustot eivät voi tallentaa evästetiedostoja ilman surffaajan suostumusta.<br/><br/>Tällaisen lain täytäntöönpanon jälkeen verkkosivustoilla on nyt ponnahdusikkuna, jossa pyydetään kävijän suostumus evästetiedostojen tallentamiseen. Verkkosivustot käyttävät tällaisia tiedostoja analysoidakseen kävijöiden selauskuviota sen perusteella, mitkä mainokset sitten lähetetään käyttäjän ikkunaan. Kun hakkerointi ei enää ole meille kaikille uusi asia, luuletko, että tällaiset säännöt ja määräykset voivat estää online-väärentämisen tai tietoverkkorikollisuuden? Teknologia on kehittynyt nopeaan tahtiin, mutta silti ihmiset eivät suosi verkko-ostoksia, koska he pelkäävät henkilökohtaisten tai pankkitilitietojen joutuvan hakkeroiduiksi. Kyberrikollisuuden nousun myötä myös tiukkojen kyberlakien tarve on kasvanut, jotta niitä voitaisiin hillitä ja edistää riskitöntä ostokokemusta.<br/><br/>Kyberrikosten luokat<br/><br/>Vuosien varrella on ollut kolme suurta kyberrikosten luokkaa:<br/><br/>Tietokonejärjestelmien tapausten luvaton käyttö, johon liittyy käyttäjätunnuksien ja salasanojen hakkerointi tai varastaminen päästäkseen käsiksi kyseisen käyttäjän henkilökohtaisiin tietoihin. Tällainen takaoven käyttö on järjestetty Trojan Horsen avulla. Haittaohjelmien, kuten Trojan Housen, matojen tai tietokonevirusten jne. vapauttaminen Viimeinen luokka sisältää käyttäjän tai online-häirinnän.<br/><br/>Kyberrikosten suorat seuraukset<br/><br/>Myynnin lasku<br/><br/>Henkilöstön tuotoksen pieneneminen verkkoviiveiden vuoksi<br/><br/>Henkilökohtaisten tietojen, kuten tutkimustyön, menettäminen<br/><br/>Häiriö kommunikaatioprosessissa<br/><br/>Kyberrikosten välilliset seuraukset<br/><br/>Uskottavuuskysymys rahoitusjärjestelmässämme<br/><br/>Brändin imago tahriintuu markkinoilla<br/><br/>Kyberrikollisuus vaikuttaa yritysten välisiin suhteisiin markkinoilla<br/><br/>Luottamuksen tunne valtion politiikkaan ja valtion virastoihin menetetään<br/><br/>Kyberrikollisuuden ehkäiseminen<br/><br/>Nettizeneinä on olemassa tiettyjä varotoimia, joita meidän tulisi harkita turvallisen ja turvallisen verkkokokemuksen takaamiseksi. Seuraavassa on joitakin niistä:<br/><br/>Ensimmäinen tehtävä on pitää henkilökohtaiset tiedot itselläsi ja välttää jakamasta samaa verkossa.<br/><br/>Vältä valokuvien jakamista verkossa chat-ystävien tai vieraiden kanssa.<br/><br/>Virustorjuntaohjelman uusimman version asentaminen järjestelmään voi tarjota hyvän puolustuslinjan Internet-uhkia, kuten viruksia ja haittaohjelmia, vastaan.<br/><br/>Arvokkaiden tietojen varmuuskopioiminen on hyvä vaihtoehto välttää ongelmia, kuten viruskontaminaatiota.<br/><br/>Vältä luottokorttitietojen lähettämistä sivustoille, jotka ovat vakuudettomia ja joilla ei ole voimassa olevaa varmennetta.<br/><br/>Turvallisuusohjelman asentaminen, joka tarjoaa sinulle mahdollisuuden hallita sivuston evästeitä ja säästää sinua verkkosivustojen seuraamiselta.<br/><br/>Isäntäpohjaisten tunkeutumisen havaitsemislaitteiden asettaminen palvelimille auttaa sinua seuraamaan verkkosivustosi liikenteen väärinkäytöksiä.<br/><br/>Palomuurin käyttöä suositellaan.<br/><br/>Miksi kyberhyökkäykset ovat niin suosittuja?<br/><br/>Halvempi kuin perinteiset huijausmenetelmät<br/><br/>Kyberrikosten jäljittäminen ei ole helppoa<br/><br/>Tarkkaa sijaintia ei voi helposti jäljittää<br/><br/>Fyysisen esteen puuttuminen internet-maailmassa<br/><br/>Kyberrikokset koskettavat suurta määrää ihmisiä<br/><br/>Johtopäätös<br/><br/>Se, että ihmismielellä on mittaamaton valta, on kiistatonta, minkä vuoksi internetrikokset lisääntyvät huimaa vauhtia. Jopa historia on todistanut joitakin suurimmista Internet-tietoturvasta, joka on mennyt hakkereiden käsiin, jotka ovat helposti päässeet myös. Ainoa tapa hillitä tällaista rikollisuutta on pysyä tietoisena nykyisistä kyberlaeista, jotka voivat olla joko internetin tai verkkosivustojen/IT-toimittajien kautta. Tietotekniikkalakia on tasapainotettava siten, että se osoittautuu liian tiukaksi ihmisille, jotka ovat mukana kyberrikollisuudessa, ja samalla sen ei pitäisi koskaan haitata Internet-teollisuuden kasvua.<br/><br/>Author Bio:- Maneet Puri johtaa tällä hetkellä laadukasta web-suunnitteluyritystä, joka sijaitsee New Delhissä Intiassa.
