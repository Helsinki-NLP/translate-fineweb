| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>19 marras 2015<br/>Lähettäjä Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa on monivuotinen kasvi, joka viihtyy suomaisilla subtrooppisilla ja trooppisilla alueilla ympäri maailmaa. Arvostettu yrtti on keskeinen ainesosa Doxerolissa, ravintolisässä, joka parantaa kognitiivista toimintaa. Bacopa valittiin sen kyvystä suojata aivoja ja lisätä asetyylikoliinia, biokemiallista lähetintä, jonka avulla hermosto välittää tietoa.<br/><br/>Ayurveda-harjoittajat kuvailivat bacopan terapeuttisia ominaisuuksia ensimmäisen kerran vuonna 300 eaa. Lääkärit kirjasivat bacopan kyvyt älykkyyden ja muistin parantamiseksi. Lähes 2500 vuotta myöhemmin kasvava joukko nykyaikaista tutkimusta vahvistaa bacopan kognitiiviset hyödyt, jotka on kirjattu ayurvediseen tekstiin.<br/><br/>Vuonna 1987 intialaiset tutkijat arvioivat bacopan vaikutuksia kouluikäisten lasten älylliseen toimintaan, ja neliviikkoisen tutkimuksen aikana he antoivat bacopaa 40:lle 6-8-vuotiaalle lapselle. Tutkijat päättelivät, että bacopa lisäsi havaintokykyä ja muistia. Lapset pystyivät ratkaisemaan sokkeloharjoituksia nopeammin ja tarkemmin saatuaan bacopaa. Monet intialaiset vanhemmat käyttävät bacopaa rutiininomaisesti parantaakseen lastensa älyllistä kehitystä.<br/><br/>Psychopharmacology-lehden elokuun 2001 numerossa julkaistussa 12 viikkoa kestäneessä tutkimuksessa tutkittiin bacopan vaikutuksia kognitiivisiin toimintoihin. Tutkijat antoivat satunnaisesti terveille vapaaehtoisille, iältään 18-65-vuotiaille, mahdollisuuden saada bacopaa tai inaktiivista ainetta. He käyttivät tutkimuksessa myös kaksoissokeaa konfiguraatiota tuotteiden identiteettien salaamiseen. Tutkijat käyttävät tätä muotoilua varmistaakseen, että testitulokset ovat päteviä, koska se poistaa tutkijoiden ja osallistujien puolueellisuuden. Bacopa-ryhmä koki merkittävää parannusta nopeudessa, jolla he pystyivät käsittelemään visuaalista tietoa. Osallistujat oppivat myös nopeammin ja varastoivat uusia muistoja tehokkaammin.<br/><br/>Vuonna 2007 Texas A&M College of Medicinen laboratoriotutkimus paljasti yhden niistä mekanismeista, jotka ovat vastuussa bacopan kyvystä edistää aivojen terveyttä. Tutkijoiden mukaan bacopa käyttää polyfenoleja estämään oksidatiivista stressiä ja sen aiheuttamia vaurioita terveille aivosoluille. Bacopa vähentää myös beeta-amyloidina tunnetun aineen haitallisia esiintymiä, joka on Alzheimerin tautia sairastavien potilaiden aivojen plakin ensisijainen komponentti.<br/><br/>Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine -lehden heinäkuun 2008 numerossa julkaistussa kaksoissokkotutkimuksessa arvioitiin bacopan vaikutusta iäkkäisiin potilaisiin. Tutkimus vahvisti, että bacopa lisäsi kognitiivista suorituskykyä vähentäen samalla stressiä. Tekijöiden mukaan tässä tutkimuksessa saavutetut hyödyt vahvistivat aikaisempien tutkimusten tulokset.<br/><br/>Fytoterapiatutkimuksen joulukuun 2008 numerossa julkaistu 90 päivän tutkimus vahvistaa kognitiiviset hyödyt, jotka osoitettiin aiemmin muissa bacopa-tutkimuksissa. Bacopa paransi merkittävästi osallistujien kykyä tallentaa ja käyttää tilapäisesti monimutkaisen tehtävän suorittamiseen tarvittavaa tietoa. Kaksoissokkotutkimus osoitti myös, että bacopa lyhensi visuaalisen tiedon käsittelyyn tarvittavaa aikaa.<br/><br/>Hermosignaalin välittämisen tehostamisen lisäksi tutkijat teoretisoivat, että bacopa lisää kognitiivista toimintaa vähentämällä ahdistusta. Lukuisat tutkimukset osoittavat, että ahdistus häiritsee kykyä suorittaa tehtäviä, jotka vaativat korkeamman tason kognitiivisia toimintoja, kuten oppimista ja muistamista. Bacopa lievittää stressiä ja palauttaa rauhallisuuden tunteen nostamalla asetyylikoliinitasoja, mikä vähentää sydämen sykettä ja mahdollistaa syvemmän hengityksen.<br/><br/>Doxiderol on loistava tapa saada bacopan edut. Tämä kokonaisvaltainen lisäosa sisältää myös muita luonnollisia ainesosia, jotka edistävät aivojen terveyttä ja tukevat kykyäsi keskittyä ja keskittyä monimutkaiseen tehtävään sekä muistaa tietoja. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state. There's a lot weighing on her mind since she had to fight her birth family against her will and last time she saw them they all pretty much hated her. Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war. I feel they could be friends as Corrin is quite open in her personality, extremely trusting as well. She's just... hiding and struggling through a lot.

I love your idea of Kagome taking a pic of Elsa! You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there!

Kun hän syntyi ja kasvoi, hänen voimansa olivat kuitenkin sinetöidyt ja hän oli paljon vähemmän voimakas. Sen jälkeen, kun Kagome oli lyönyt voimansa, Kagome on saavuttanut täyden potentiaalinsa.<br/><br/>PUHDISTUS Tekemällä fyysisen yhteyden Kagomella on kyky puhdistaa sekä myrkky että pimeys kohteesta (elävästä ja elottomasta). Tehdäkseen niin hän projisoi henkiset voimansa kätensä kautta.<br/><br/>HENGELLISET BARRIERIT Täydellä potentiaalillaan Kagomella on kyky luoda este itsensä ympärille ja laajentaa sitä muiden ympärille. Se on kupolin muotoinen este, joka voi tuhota heikkoja demoneita, jotka saavat yhteyden esteeseen.<br/><br/>PARANNETTU NÄKY<br/>Kagomella on kyky nähdä asioita, jotka ovat usein ihmissilmälle näkymättömiä: aaveita, henkiä, jumalallisia ja pahoja auroja.<br/><br/>MAHDOLLISUUDET aseisiin<br/>Kagomella on kyky käyttää jousta ja nuolta. Hän on saanut itse koulutuksen, ja vuosien harjoittelun jälkeen hänen nuolensa harvoin jättää jälkensä. Tämän rinnalla Kagomella on kyky valaa nuolensa voimilla. Hän voi valaa nuolia henkisillä voimillaan, joiden avulla ne tunkeutuvat demonisiin voimiin, tuhoavat loitsuja ja puhdistavat esineitä. Hän voi valaa jousensa voimillaan ja torjua vihollisen hyökkäykset. Hän kykenee valamaan nuoliinsa puhdistavaa energiaa puhdistaakseen myrkkyä sekä voimakkaita, kaukaisia demonisia hyökkäyksiä. Ja lopuksi hänellä on kyky ohittaa muut nuolellaan: Jos hänen kohteensa sattuu olemaan esteen takana tai panttivangin takana, nuoli voi teleportata ja osua vain hänen kohteeseensa.<br/><br/>Loput hänen kyvyistään ovat tulleet melko merkityksettömiksi, sillä ne liittyvät aikamatkustukseen (luunsyöjän kaivon kautta), Shikon-jalokiveen tai hänen aiempaan inkarnaatioonsa.<br/><br/>Kanuuna<br/><br/>Kagome on kuitenkin vedetty pois muutama päivä lukion valmistumisensa jälkeen, ennen kuin Luunsyöjän kaivo on jälleen avautunut, jotta hän voisi palata menneisyyteen pysyvästi.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>muistot<br/><br/>- Mitä?<br/><br/>Hänen nimensä ääni oli pehmeä kuiskaus hänen takaraivossaan, kuin tuulen vaimentama kutsu. Se oli kaukaisen muiston ääni, ääni, jonka hän oli alkanut unohtaa, mutta joka kuitenkin epätoivoisesti takertui siihen. Se oli hänen äitinsä ääni, vääntynyt hänen kadonneen tyttärensä surussa. Jälkeenpäin Kagome karkotettiin jäljettömiin. Hän muisti elävästi ne hetket, miten päivä oli alkanut, mitä hän oli syönyt aamiaiseksi ja viimeisen asian, jonka hän oli sanonut äidilleen. Se oli kummittelua, nuo muistot, koska se oli kuin mikä tahansa muu kerta, kun hän oli livahtanut maailmojen välillä. Hän oli herännyt, sanaton, koska hänellä ei ollut mitään tarkoitusta koulun ulkopuolella. Hän saattoi löytää työpaikan, ja hänet oli määrätty haastatteluun sinä päivänä. Hänen sydämensä ei ollut ollut siinä mukana, mutta se oli se, mitä hänen piti tehdä.<br/><br/>Hän muisti pelon tunteen, imi sen itseensä ja piti itselleen kannustuspuheen, että hän voisi tehdä tämän, että hän voisi edistyä siinä elämässä, johon hänen oli tarkoitus nyt, kun asiat oli ratkaistu menneisyydessä. Hänellä oli tietysti sellainen tunne, ettei hän enää kuulunut omaan aikaansa tai omaan elämäänsä, ei kaiken jälkeensä jättämänsä kanssa.<br/><br/>Kagome muisti sormiensa alla olevan puun tunteen, tavan, jolla hänen kätensä oli käpertynyt kahvaan liukuakseen oven auki. Hän muisti pysähtyneensä ja kääntyneensä äitinsä puoleen kirkkaalla ja eloisalla hymyllä ravistellessaan itseään tokkurasta. "Minä lähden." Hän muisti, kuinka vahvalta hänen äänensä kuulosti, hymy äitinsä huulilla, kun hänen silmänsä loistivat ylpeydestä. Hänen äitinsä jätti jäähyväiset, mikä ei tuntunut yhtään erilaiselta kuin ennen, mutta jotenkin sanojen paino asettui raskaammaksi Kagomen hartioille sitä enemmän, mitä enemmän hän heijastui.<br/><br/>Lyhyesti ajateltuna ajatukset välkkyivät eteenpäin, miettien huolestuttiko hänen äitinsä häntä, kaipasivat häntä kuten hän. Kagome saattoi avoimesti myöntää, että hänen äitinsä voimat, hänen tukensa sille, että hänen tyttärensä luiskahti läpi ajan niin usein. Oli aikoja, jolloin hän piti itseään heikkona, koska hänellä ei ollut naista, johon nojata.<br/><br/>Hän kuitenkin muisti, että hän keräsi niukasti voimia. Hän pystyi muistamaan ilmassa tapahtuneen muutoksen, lämpötilan huomattavan erilaisen kuin mitä hän oli odottanut, räpytellen äkisti ja tuntemattomassa ympäristössä. Se ei ollut hänen perheensä pyhäkkö, ja kun hän kääntyi mennäkseen takaisin, livahtaakseen sisään ovesta, josta oli tullut, hänet kohtasi tuntematon ja kylmä metalli sormenpäidensä alla ja sisustus, joka ei ollut hänen talonsa sisäänkäynti. Mies seisoi hänen edessään tiskin takana, joka tuijotti häntä yhtä levein silmin kuin hänen omansa.<br/><br/>Hän ei ainakaan panikoinut, vaan joutui ajan repimäksi ja mahdottomiin tilanteisiin - ja rakensi edes tahdonvoimaansa niin pitkälle kuin oudot tapahtumat menivät. Koska demoni ei raahannut itseään joka päivä menneisyyteen aikomuksenaan repiä heidän ruumiistaan voimakas jalokivi, jota he eivät edes tienneet olevan olemassa. Ja sitten oli se tosiasia, että hän oli pirstonut sanottua voimakasta jalokiveä ties kuinka moneen osaan ja hänen tehtävänään oli löytää ne. Sellaiset asiat eivät olleet normaaleja, ja hänen oli täytynyt ryhdistäytyä ja rullata sen kanssa, kun hän tajusi, että se oli hänen todellisuutensa. Se oli tuntunut niin yksinkertaiselta, että keräsi vain sirpaleet ja korjasi jalokiven.<br/><br/>Mutta se ei ollut ollut helppoa, oli monia demoneita sirpaleiden ja itse jalokiven jälkeen ja yksi erityisen voimakas demoni, jolla oli toive, jonka hän oli päättänyt nähdä toteutuvan. Tähän päivään asti hän ei ollut koskaan saanut tietää hänen toivettaan, mutta tiesi, ettei sitä ollut koskaan myönnetty edes sen jälkeen, kun hän oli saanut kirotun asian valmiiksi. Hän oli pilannut niin monta elämää turhaan. Pilannut niin monta elämää niin turhan tehtävän vuoksi. Naraku oli ollut vaikein vihollinen ja se, joka oli ollut kaiken sen keskipisteenä, mikä oli mennyt pieleen hänen ystävänsä elämässä.<br/><br/>Mutta se oli tuo arvaamattomuus, se välttämättömyys vyöryä sen mukana, mitä oli tapahtumassa, ja se tahdonvoima, jonka hän oli saanut seikkailustaan, jonka hän muisti ammentaen keksivän tarinan, joka sopi hetkeen, joka ei tuntunut liian oikulliselta tai kaukaa haetulta. Hän tarvitsi uskoa, hänen täytyi selviytyä.<br/><br/>Jälkeenpäin hän kohtasi pahempaa kuin mies kamerakaupassa, hän oli valehdellut hampaidensa kautta pelastaakseen henkensä aiemmin.<br/><br/>"Etsin töitä." Loppujen lopuksi se ei ollut täydellinen valhe. Loppujen lopuksi hän oli lähtenyt kotoaan tarkoituksenaan osallistua työhaastatteluun. Hänen pukeutumistilansa ainakin todistaisi sen. Se oli yksi helpoimmista fibeistä, joita hän oli koskaan kertonut.<br/><br/>Ja jostain syystä se hullu mies palkkasi hänet.<br/><br/>- Mitä?<br/><br/>Kagomed kierähti vuoteessaan työntäessään etäisiä muistoja taaksepäin, kieltäytyen tunnustamasta olleensa todella hereillä. Hän kynsi viimeisiä unen välähdyksiä anoen sitä palaamaan ja ottamaan hänet takaisin syleilyynsä. Hän sulki silmänsä, tahtoi nukkua tullakseen ja kohtasi vain muistoja. Laulun kaiut lauloivat hänen muistojensa etäisyydessä, laulun, joka oli usein piinannut häntä, samannimisenä kuin hän. Laulava ääni ei enää muistuttanut hänen äitiään, vaan lasten ääniä, joiden kanssa hän oli usein leikkinyt kasvaessaan. He kutsuivat muistot takaisin, vaikka siitä oli vuosia, kun hän aloitti tämän livenä, vaikka hän oli onnellinen tässä elämässä, näiden muistojen kutsu oli liian äänekäs.<br/><br/>Yhtäkkiä hän oli vajoamassa takaisin niihin ja uni väisti häntä taas. Hän katseli itseään perheensä syleilyssä, kun Inuyasha vedettiin takaisin kaivoon, näyttäen yhtä säikähtäneeltä kuin hän oli tuntenut. Tuon hetken muistot, nuo tunteet, olivat vielä niin voimakkaita, että sydänsurun ja surun tunne paisui jälleen, vaikka siitä oli niin kauan, kun hänestä oli tuntunut, että hänet oli revitty pois kaikesta hänelle tärkeästä.<br/><br/>Tietysti hänen perheellään oli väliä, ja hän oli onnellinen saadessaan olla jälleen heidän sylissään, eikä hän voinut koskaan täysin, todella kuvailla, miltä hänestä oli tuntunut noina päivinä. Hän ei vieläkään osannut selittää, miten hän tunsi jakautuneensa kahtia, sotivien halujen ollessa sekä menneisyydessään että nykyisyydessään. Hän muisti turhat yritykset hypätä kaivon läpi, sormien kynsiessä maata epätoivoisessa anomuksessa antaa hänen palata. Ensimmäisenä kuukautena kotona hän ei nukkunut niin paljon kuin itki.<br/><br/>Elysion oli koristellut samanlaisen reaktion, vaikkakaan se ei ollut niin raju, koska hän ei tiennyt tarkalleen, mistä oli päässyt läpi, eikä hän tiennyt, mistä hän voisi matoa tiensä takaisin. Hänen tutkimuksensa olivat hienovaraisia työnteon ja tähän elämään asettumisen välillä. Hänellä ei ollut aikomusta jäädä, ei aikomusta viipyä pidempään kuin hän tarvitsi. Vaikka hän ei yrittänytkään niin kiihkeästi kuin yrittäessään palata menneisyyteen, hänen intohimonsa oli kymmenkertainen, koska hänellä ei ollut siteitä tähän maailmaan, koska hän oli todella yksin, vailla toivoa kenenkään tavoittamisesta.<br/><br/>Irrationaalisina hetkinään hän luuli, että Jalokivi oli vetänyt hänet takaisin ja löytänyt uuden helvetin, jossa hän voisi asua, uuden helvetin, joka pakottaisi hänet esittämään toiveen, mutta hän muisti hyvin selvästi, että hän oli toivonut sen menevän ikuisiksi ajoiksi. Se ei estänyt hänen unelmiaan, niitä aikoja, jolloin hän heräsi yöllä nyyhkyttäen, ja ne muistot hänen menneisyydestään olivat vaikeimpia käsitellä, vaikeimpia unohtaa. Hänen sydämensä alkoi juosta paniikissa, kun hän kääntyi jälleen sängyssään, hänen hengityksestään tuli kamppailua, kun hän taisteli harhailevan mielensä aiheuttamaa paniikkikohtausta vastaan näin myöhään yöhön.<br/><br/>Hän inhosi heikkoutta ja pelkoa.<br/><br/>- Mitä?<br/><br/>Kagome veti lopulta itsensä sängystä, hänen huoneensa valaistiin vaalealla valolla, joka riitti ohjaamaan hänet kylpyhuoneeseen. Hän seisoi peilin edessä, pesuallas juoksemassa katsellen hänen heijastustaan. Korpinväriset hiukset peittivät hänen kasvonsa ja hänestä tuntui yhtä pahalta kuin hän näytti. Hänen ensimmäinen aamunsa Elysionissa oli samanlainen, vain hän oli huonommassa kunnossa.<br/><br/>Hän oli löytänyt nukkumapaikan, ja onnistui saamaan aikaan sopimuksen rakennuksen omistajan kanssa, jotta hän voisi jäädä vähäksi aikaa maksamatta. Ehkä Mirokun vaikutusvalta oli antanut hänelle mahdollisuuden tehdä tällaisia sopimuksia, sillä munkki tunnettiin tavastaan hurmata (tai huijata) ihmisiä antamaan heille enemmän kuin tarpeeksi heidän tekemäänsä työhön. Munkki oli aina ollut sellainen, koska he olivat ensin tavanneet. Hän väittäisi herran asunnon kummittelevan, kun sitä ei ollut, tai väittäisi, että he joutuivat hyökkäyksen kohteeksi, kun he eivät olisi. Hän myisi osastonsa ja hurmaa niin korkeilla hinnoilla. Se toimi käytännössä joka kerta ja hän ihmetteli, miksi ihmiset olivat olleet niin halukkaita luottamaan häneen.<br/><br/>Ehkä syynä oli hänen hymynsä tai se, että hän oli munkki, jota menneisyyden ihmiset olivat niin halukkaita murentamaan, ettei hän ainakaan koskaan saalistanut heikkoja. Hän teki aina sen, mikä oli oikein ja hän oli voiman symboli hänelle silloin, kun hän työnsi kaiken läpi tehdäkseen sen, mikä oli oikein. Hän työnsi läpi sen, että hän oli kuolemaisillaan, että hän oli kirottu, ja yritti tehdä asialle jotain sen sijaan, että olisi rypenyt kohtalossaan. Hän oli työntänyt itsensä äärirajoille ennen heidän lopullista taisteluaan. Ja hän oli ollut iloinen siitä, että he olivat voittaneet Narakun, ennen kuin tämä saattoi joutua saman kohtalon alaiseksi kuin hänen isänsä ja hänen isänsä ennen häntä.<br/><br/>Oman viehätyksensä osalta hän oli kuitenkin reilumpi kuin ystävänsä ja teki sopimuksesta järkevän. Hän epäili, ettei kukaan tässä maailmassa maksaisi mojovaa hintaa manauksesta tai demonien karkottamisesta. He olivat siihen liian teknisesti kehittyneitä. Hän oli kuitenkin tarpeeksi fiksu ja fiksu tehdäkseen hyvän diilin.<br/><br/>Mutta nyt Kagome oli paremmassa paikassa, vaikka hänen ilmeensä näytti samalta.<br/><br/>Vilkaisu seinällä olevaan kelloon kertoi hänelle, että hän voisi yrittää nukkua pidempään, mutta hän ei halunnut kohdata takaumia uudelleen. Sen sijaan hän kävi suihkussa käyttäen kylmää vettä demoniensa karkottamiseen, täyttääkseen keuhkonsa terävällä hengityksellä ja pakottaakseen itsensä valveille.<br/><br/>- Mitä?<br/><br/>Se ei toiminut.<br/><br/>Ei sillä tavalla kuin hän halusi. Kylmä vesi varmasti pakotti ilman hänen keuhkoihinsa, pakotti hänen mielensä heräämään ja lihakset tarttumaan. Katkera nauru vedettiin hänen huuliltaan, kun hän kallisti päätään taaksepäin ja huomasi muistavansa enemmän. Tänään hän ei paennut heitä niin helposti eikä toipunut niin yksinkertaisesti, vain koska tahtoi.<br/><br/>Joskus ei voi vältellä haluamiaan ajatuksia silloinkaan, kun oli varma niiden ohittamisesta.<br/><br/>Sangosta olisi ollut paljon apua tässä tilanteessa. Demonintappaja oli hänen paras ystävänsä, hän jopa kutsui häntä sisareksi, jota hänellä ei koskaan ollut. Vanhempi sisar, joka oli viisas, oli aina hänen puolellaan, kun ongelmia syntyi. Varsinkin poikavaikeuksista, kun sellaiset asiat olivat melko vähäpätöisiä, mutta oli hauskaa olla ihastunut ja että hänen ystävänsä suuttui hänen puolestaan, kun Inuyasha teki hänet surulliseksi. Olihan usein ollut niin, että puolidemoni juoksi kuolleen rakastajansa puolelle ja särki tämän sydämen useammin kuin kerran.<br/><br/>Mutta Sango inspiroi häntä myös muilla tavoin, kaiken sen jälkeen, mitä nainen oli kohdannut, hän oli aina ollut niin vahva, niin varma... Jopa aikoina, jolloin hän oli epäillyt itseään, hän aina selviytyi. Hän ihaili sitä, että hänellä oli kyky selviytyä menetettyään koko perheensä - muistutus tästä työnsi usein Kagomen henkiin, koska hän menetti kaikki tälle maailmalle - ja sitten hänen veljensä tuli Narakun pelinappulaksi. Se ei ollut helppoa, ei voinut olla jotain, että vain kuka tahansa voisi kohdata ja silti mennä eteenpäin. Hän silti hymyili, vaikka se kipu ja ne muistutukset... Hän oli usein niin kirkas, jopa synkempinä aikoina.<br/><br/>Ja juuri nyt, hän halusi nojata vanhemman naisen puolelle, lohduttautua sillä, että hän oli siellä ja hän oli tukena. Hän tunsi, että Sango jotenkin vetäisi tämän läpi, ja tarjosi joitakin sanoja voimaa ja ymmärrystä. Juuri tällaiset ajat pahensivat näitä loitsuja, jatkuvaa muistutusta siitä, että hän oli ilman perhettään.<br/><br/>"En halua olla yksin." Hän huusi ääneen yksinäisyydessään, kun suihkun ääni hukutti anomuksen.<br/><br/>Hän ei pelännyt myöntää sitä.<br/><br/>- Mitä?<br/><br/>Tunti oli kulunut ennen kuin hän tajusi sen. Hänen ihonsa oli kylmä vedestä ja tuntui kuin jää olisi valunut hänen suonissaan. Hän ei ollut tajunnut, että hän oli alkanut täristä, kunnes hänen kätensä kurkotti sammuttamaan veden ja lopettamaan suihkun. Kagome ei etsinyt enää omaa katsettaan peilistä, vaan hän kääriytyi pyyhkeisiin ja tarpoi ulos kylpyhuoneesta, portaita ylös ja keittiöönsä. Hän alkoi tehdä kevyttä aamiaista, lukeen joutilaana päivälle muistiinpanojaan, kun ruoka oli kypsennetty.<br/><br/>Hänen uransa oli todella nousussa näinä viimeisinä vuosina. Hänen kuviaan oli esillä monissa gallerioissa, hänen nimensä alkoi käydä usein monilla huulilla valokuvauksesta kiinnostuneille.<br/><br/>Työ, jota hän oli hetken mielijohteesta pyytänyt, oli sytyttänyt kaiken. Hän oli ollut paljon onnekkaampi kuin hän oli odottanutkaan tässä maailmassa. Ei koskaan tarpeeksi onnekas livahtaakseen takaisin raoista omaan maailmaansa, mutta tarpeeksi onnekas pärjätäkseen hyvin. Kun hän kääntyi takaisin hellalle, hän muisti ajan, jonka hän oli lopulta luopunut kotiinpaluusta. Se oli noin kaksi vuotta hänen elämästään täällä, sillä hän oli alkanut uskaltautua valokuvaukseen enemmän kuin pelkkänä harrastuksena, mutta sellaisena, jolla hän voisi tehdä itselleen nimeä.<br/><br/>Tuo päivä oli ollut erityisen miellyttävä, aurinko oli korkealla taivaalla ja hän oli löytänyt itsensä ottamasta kuvia luonnonmaisemista. Pieni poika oli piiloutunut yhteen kasveista, ja hän oli saanut kuvan hetkestä, jolloin hänen kasvonsa olivat asettuneet iloiseksi, ilkikuriseksi virnistyshetkeksi, ennen kuin hän oli hypännyt ulos säikäyttämään saaliinsa. Se muistutti häntä Shippousta, pienestä kitsunesta, jonka hän oli olennaisesti adoptoinut. Hänetkin oli revitty perheestään, kun he olivat ensi kertaa tavanneet. Hänen isänsä tappoi ja hän oli päättänyt kostaa. Nuorena hän vaikutti niin kypsältä heidän ensikohtaamisessaan.<br/><br/>Ehkä se oli ollut Inuyashan vaikutus, joka antoi pakin käyttäytyä taas kuin lapsi, olla toisinaan nuori ja oikukas, kun taas toiset hän oli kypsempi. Hän tarjosi hänelle lohtua omalla tavallaan, ja hän yritti huolehtia hänestä kuin omastaan, vaikka hän oli ollut niin nuori silloinkin. Hänen nuoruutensa ei kuitenkaan estänyt häntä ymmärtämästä, miten hoitaa häntä tai hoitaa häntä kuin lastaan. Hänen sydämensä paisui, kun hän hymyili, kun hän oli ollut niin onnellinen väriliitujen lahjastaan ja ottanut aikaa taiteen tekemiseen. Hän oli niin ylpeä jokaisesta piirroksesta, että oli saanut sen valmiiksi, että tiesi, että tällaiselta äidistä tuntuisi tällaisessa tilanteessa.<br/><br/>Tuska, joka oli repinyt hänen lävitseen, oli liian suuri, liian äkillinen. Hän kaipasi häntä ja halusi nähdä, kuinka paljon hän oli kasvanut sen jälkeen, kun hän oli ollut poissa. Hän oli kaivannut niin paljon...<br/><br/>Säästääkseen itsensä lisäkivuilta, vääriltä toiveilta hän luopui ja keskittyi parantamaan itseään.<br/><br/>- Mitä?<br/><br/>Aamiainen maistui mauttomalta, tylsältä ja innoitetulta, ja vasta lopetettuaan hän tajusi unohtaneensa kaikenlaiset mausteet tai maun ruoalle. Nyt oli liian myöhäistä muistaa sitä paljon, sillä hänen mielensä oli liian kiireinen muistaessaan muita yksityiskohtia elämästään, joista oli selvästi tullut tärkeämpiä kuin hänen ruokansa.<br/><br/>"Istu!"<br/><br/>Mitään ei tietenkään tapahtunut, kun hän oli vihaisesti huutanut eräälle erityisen turhauttavalle asiakkaalle, joka muistutti häntä puolidemonista. Hän oli erityisen itsepäinen ja töykeä, halusi valokuvan otettavan hänen tavallaan sen sijaan, että antaisi sen toimia luonnollisesti. Voit yrittää pakottaa villieläimet käyttäytymään miten haluat. Mutta harvoin kukaan onnistui voimalla. Inuyasha ei kuitenkaan ollut niin paha. Inuyasha oli oppinut ennen kuin hänet oli pakotettu pois hänestä. Hänestä oli tullut lempeämpi, ymmärtäväisempi ja kypsempi, vaikka oli aikoja, jolloin hän oli vielä lapsellinen ja koppava.<br/><br/>Hän muistaa kuinka punaiset hänen poskensa olivat palaneet, mutta kuinka hän piti pintansa ja erotti hänet. Hän kertoi kieltäytyneensä työskentelemästä kenenkään tai kenenkään kanssa, joka halusi vääntää jotain sen luonnon, omien halujen yli.<br/><br/>Hänen olisi pitänyt verrata miestä mieluummin Narakuun kuin Inuyashaan, vaikka hänen asiakkaallaan ei ollut niin äärimmäisiä aikeita, ainakin tunne jälkikäteen oli miellyttävä muisto. Vapaus tietää, että hän oli tullut niin pitkälle, että hän saattoi kieltäytyä työstä, jota hän ei halunnut tehdä, olla oma itsensä, joka oli riippumaton muista. Vaikka hän kuuli huhuja päiviä myöhemmin sanoilla, joiden tarkoitus oli herjata häntä.<br/><br/>Hän puolusti itseään hurskaasti, kuten teki matkansa loppupuolella, olihan hän ainoa, joka pystyi suojelemaan itseään tässä maailmassa.<br/><br/>- Mitä?<br/><br/>Aamun valo alkoi hiipiä hänen kotiinsa muistuttaen häntä jälleen ajan kulumisesta. Jälleen hän harkitsi listaa tekemistään asioista ja keskusteli siitä, mistä aloittaa. Tai pitäisikö hänen edes aloittaa ollenkaan. Kun päivä alkoi, hän ei tiennyt, voisiko hän pitää sitä suurena ideana, - oli epätodennäköistä, että hän onnistuisi siinä, kuinka eksyksissä hän oli.<br/><br/>Hän ei halunnut sotkea viimeisintä työtään, - koska hän oli tehnyt sitä pari kertaa aiemminkin, - eikä ollut miellyttävää yrittää toipua täydellisestä katastrofista.<br/><br/>Kagome muisti tunteen, kun hänen kallis, upouusi kameransa liukui hänen käsistään. Hän ei ollut valmis tukemaan sitä, koska hän oli juuri poistanut sen laukustaan. Osa hänen sisimmästään huusi. Dramaattinen, over-the-top, täynnä huutoa, jota hän usein teki, kun hän oli paljon, paljon nuorempi. Toinen osa hänestä oli jäänyt paikoilleen, kun hänen linssinsä oli täysin pirstaleina ja loput kamerasta oli katkennut sen mukana.<br/><br/>Inuyashan veljen, täyden demonin, näkeminen hänen edessään oli viimeinen asia, jota hän odotti, kun hän oli päässyt ulos valokuvistaan. Hän ei näyttänyt lainkaan hämmentyneeltä ollakseen täysin erilaisessa maailmassa, vaikka hän ei koskaan ollut paras lukemaan hänen ajatuksiaan. Hänen nimensä huulillaan oli niin voimakas, että hän muisti pienimmätkin tunteet kuten hän. Hänen huulensa olivat halkeilleet, suu tuntui kuivalta, ja vatsassa kupliva ahdistuksen tunne sai hänet voimaan pahoin.<br/><br/>Hän ei halunnut toiveidensa heräävän.<br/><br/>Mutta hän halusi hänet paikalle, vaikka he eivät olisikaan ystäviä, he olivat liittolaisia, jos mitään, sillä he olivat taistelleet rinta rinnan, ja jokin oli parempi kuin ei mitään.<br/><br/>Ja Kagomella oli tarpeeksi järkeä olla heittäytymättä hänen päälleen, kietoakseen kätensä hänen ympärilleen helpotuksena siitä, että hän ei ollut yksin, hänen kamerallaan ei ollut enää merkitystä, kun hän lähestyi häntä. Hän muisti, ettei millään muulla ollut merkitystä päiviin, kun hän vietti aikaa hänen kanssaan, ei puhuen heidän maailmastaan vaan puhuen (tai hän puhui ja hän yksinkertaisesti tunnusti tämän tosiasian).<br/><br/>Kun hän ihastui Kagomeen, vaikka Kagome ei muistanutkaan, - se oli hienovarainen asia, kuten hänkin, - mutta hän tiesi tunteen olevan olemassa, - ja hän kertoi, ettei hän ollut yksin sen suhteen, että tämä oli kaatunut, - että tunteet olivat jotenkin puhjenneet kukkaan.<br/><br/>- Mitä?<br/><br/>Painottomuuden tunne valtasi hänet ja yhtäkkiä hänen silmänsä avautuivat, samalla kun hänen mielensä kynsi epätoivoisesti viimeistä tekoaan. Hän ei muistanut, milloin oli nukahtanut sohvalleen, mutta tiesi, että viimeinen paikka, jossa hän oli ollut, oli aivan liian mukavilla tyynyillä. Hän ei kuitenkaan kamppaillut tai taistellut painottomuutta vastaan, kun hän oli tutuissa käsivarsissa. Hänen päänsä kallistui Sesshoumarun rintaa vasten lohduttautuen sillä, että hän oli täällä eikä hän ollut yksin.<br/><br/>"Tervetuloa takaisin." Hänen vastauksensa oli pehmeä hurina tunnustuksessa. Hänen ei tarvinnut puhua paljon hänen puolestaan ymmärtääkseen hänen aikeensa, tai muun mitä hänellä oli sanottavanaan.<br/><br/>Hän kantoi hänet takaisin sänkyynsä, asetti hänet siihen helposti. Hänen silmänsä kohtasivat hänen ja hän hymyili helposti, koska enää muistoja ei ajelehtinut takaisin, ei enää muistoja kiusannut häntä. Ei, aina kun hän oli lähellä, hän ei koskaan laskenut takaisin noihin ajatuksiin. Hän oli auttanut, ja vuodet olivat auttaneet.<br/><br/>"Nuku." Hän komensi helposti, hänen silmänsä vierivät häntä kohti, mutta hän ei taistellut, koska hän oli väsynyt. Hänen kätensä tarttui tiukasti häneen, kun hän tunsi vastakkaisen käden painavan otsaansa hänen hyvinvointiaan arvioitaessa.<br/><br/>"Olen kunnossa", hän sanoi, sanansa tiukasti lupauksellaan.<br/><br/>Hän oli kunnossa, elossa ja onnellinen.<br/><br/>- Mitä?<br/><br/>lähettäjä<br/><br/>yhteenveto<br/><br/>Eräässä elämänsä vaiheessa Kagome oli melko tavallinen teinityttö, kunnes hänen kimppuunsa hyökkäsi demoni hänen perheensä kaivon sisällä. Demoni raahasi hänet kaivoon, joka maagisesti kuljetti hänet noin 500 vuotta menneisyyteen. Siellä hän sai tietää, että hänen ruumiinsa sisällä oli pyhä jalokivi, sillä hän oli 50 vuotta ennen kuin hänet raahattiin sisään, kuolleen papittaren reinkarnaatio. Jalokivi revittiin hänen ruumiistaan ja demoni, joka raahasi hänet ajan halki, kukistettiin puolidemonilla, jonka hän vapautti ja joka oli kiinnitetty puuhun. Kagome ystävystyi puolidemonin, Inuyashan, kanssa ajoissa ja matkusti tämän kanssa palauttamaan jalokiven, jonka hän itse murskasi. Vaikka se ei ollut niin suoraviivaista ja helppoa, koska monet demonit ja ihmiset etsivät jalokiveä omiin tarkoituksiinsa. Hän ystävystyi nuoren kitsune-demonin, munkin ja demonintappajan kanssa, jotka kaikki matkustivat hänen kanssaan palauttamaan jalokiven.<br/><br/>Hänen ryhmänsä ei kuitenkaan ollut se, joka täydensi jalokiveä, vaan ilkeä puolidemoni, joka manipuloi suurimman osan seuralaisensa elämän suurista tapahtumista. Kun hän lopulta keräsi kaikki jalokiven palaset ja esitti toiveensa tahraantuneesta esineestä, Kagome vedettiin itse jalokiveen tarkoituksenaan tehdä itsekäs toive pitää hänet vangittuna ikuisesti, pitäen jalokiven elossa. Juuri Inuyashan itsepäisyys onnistui pelastamaan hänet pimeydeltä. Lopulta hän palasi luonnolliseen aikaansa, lopetti lukion kuten aikajanansa tytöltä odotettiin. Vaikka päiviä myöhemmin Kagome päätyi Elysioniin. Hän on ollut tässä maailmassa viisi vuotta, ja on jo kauan sitten luopunut kotiinpaluusta.<br/><br/>platoninen<br/><br/>Kagomelle on melko helppoa saada uusia ystäviä, hän ei ole juuri muuttunut nuoruudestaan. Hän on iloinen nuori nainen, joka on empaattinen ja toivottaa tervetulleeksi suurimman osan elämästään. Nuoruudessaan hän ystävystyi demonien kanssa, kun useimmat pelkäisivät niitä. Jopa demonit, jotka ennen söivät ihmisiä, hän on ystävystynyt ja muuttanut heidän tapojaan (hän haluaisi ajatella). Tästä huolimatta on todella helppoa tulla hänen ystäväkseen, kunhan joku pystyy osoittamaan, että he ovat halukkaita lunastettaviksi, tai osoittamaan, että he eivät ole täysin pahoja. Hän tuntee suurta myötätuntoa kaikkia kohtaamiaan kohtaan, joten hänen on vaikea olla tuntematta vetoa muita kohtaan halusta olla ystäviä.<br/><br/>antagonistiset<br/><br/>Ainoa tapa ansaita Kagomen viha on olla niin valitettava, niin paha ja niin kaukana lunastuksesta, ettei hän näe sinussa mitään hyvää. Ja hän näkee hyvää melkein kaikissa ja kaikessa. Rehellisesti, kenen kanssa hän on kohdannut? Puolidemoni, joka asetti kaksi rakastavaista toisiaan vastaan, kirosi yhden ystävänsä koko mieslinjan ja sitten tapatti parhaan ystävänsä veljen heidän perheensä... Joo, en näe hänen vihaavan ketään ilman heitä todella, todella työskentelevän sen puolesta. Voit kuitenkin vapaasti antaa sille mahdollisuuden.<br/><br/>romanttinen<br/><br/>Rakastuessaan Kagome on vahva tuki, pysyen aina siellä silloinkin, kun asiat voivat olla karkeita. Kagome ei kuitenkaan etsi rakkautta, ei etsinyt rakkautta saapuessaan, joten mitään aiempia suhteita ei ole olemassa. Tämä ei tarkoita sitä, että joku ei olisi rakastunut häneen. Hän voi varmasti olla jonkun vastikkeettoman rakkauden kohde, hän on todennäköisesti tietämätön siitä, vaikka. Lopulta Kagome on tällä hetkellä yllättäen kihloissa Sesshoumarun kanssa. Olen kuitenkin täysin avoin mahdollisille AU:n asioille. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .<br/><br/>fandom helvetti<br/><br/>Ikivanha<br/><br/>laji avaruus kuningatar<br/><br/>Miehitys kuolemassa<br/><br/>Mieluiten hän/hän<br/><br/>palkinnot<br/><br/>pro she/her est 62woo i imaista juoni vastauksia. mutta ok muutenkin!!! neptune on erittäin ystävällinen ja on, että "cool" persoona, hän on todella hauska olla noin, ja hän on SUPER hyvä työskennellä. kuten hän on super kärsivällinen ja hän tekee mitä tahansa hän pyytää häneltä - hän on todella helppo työskennellä, ehdottomasti verrattuna muihin malleihin. joten rakastan ajatusta, että he ovat kaikki työorientoituneita ystäviä aluksi ja muuttuvat sitten joksikin enemmän. neptune yrittää ehdottomasti ympäröidä itsensä ihmisillä, koska hän rakastaa ystäviä, ja kagome on myös melko paljon hänen tyyppiään? kuten hän on suloinen ja hän on vahva nainen, ja hän on itse asiassa parempi ystäviä naisten kuin miesten kanssa, idk miksi, hän vain rakastaa olla ympärillä naispuolisia ystäviä, jotka tietävät.

Suoraan sanottuna hän ei ole käynyt läpi kaikkea vielä sen jälkeen, kun hän oli lähinnä täysimittaisen sodan johdossa. Minusta tuntuu, että he voisivat olla ystäviä, koska Corrin on melko avoin persoonallisuudessaan, myös erittäin luottavainen. Hän vain... piileskelee ja kamppailee paljon.

Hän on myös laulaja/esiintyjä paikallisessa teatterissa, joten voin kuvitella Kagomen menevän sinne tutkimaan asioita ja sitten nappaavan Elsan backstagen tai jotain - ja sitten ystävyys voisi kukoistaa sieltä!

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Miksi sinun pitäisi olla Twitterissä<br/><br/>Vastuuvapauslauseke: En ole, enkä ole koskaan väittänyt olevani, sosiaalisen median guru. Olen vain henkilö, joka ajattelee asioita paljon, ja tämä on tullut esiin useita kertoja.<br/><br/>En ole varhainen adoptoija. Joskus minulta kestää vuosia selvittää, mihin haluan käyttää jotain ennen kuin todella pääsen siihen, ja Twitter oli yksi niistä asioista. Olen ollut Twitterissä vakavasti noin tämän vuoden helmikuusta lähtien, joten olen melko uusi siinä. Silti olen oppinut useita asioita, ja halusin jakaa ne. Jotkut sanovat, että olen Twitter-työntäjä, ja minä olen, koska siihen on paljon hyviä syitä, eikä käytännössä ole huonoja puolia.<br/><br/>Mikä on Twitter? Jos olet internetissä, olet luultavasti ainakin kuullut siitä. Se on sosiaalisen median verkosto, joka toimii keskustelujen, päivitysten ja uutisten foorumina mediassa, joka on enemmän julkinen kuin jotain Facebookia tai LinkedIniä. Facebook on siitä, kuka haluaa löytää sinut, mutta Twitter on siitä, kuka haluat löytää. Suosikkikirjailijasi, näyttelijäsi, poliitikkosi, laulajasi ja tiedemiehesi ovat todennäköisesti Twitterissä. Niin ovat myös suosikkihyväntekeväisyyskohteesi, radioasemasi, uutissivustosi ja myymäläsi. Ja he haluavat sinun löytävän heidät ja kuuntelevan, mitä heillä on sanottavaa. Kaikki Twitterissä, ainakin aluksi, haluavat puhua kanssasi.<br/><br/>Mutta miksi liittyä siihen, miksi olla osa sitä? On kaikenlaisia syitä, ja annan teille muutamia.<br/><br/>Ihmiset ja paikat Twitter on loistava tapa saada tietoa tapahtumista, joita tapahtuu ympäri maailmaa, mutta myös yhteisössäsi. Jos matkustat ja etsit tekemistä, se on loistava tapa saada selville asioita, jotka liittyvät kiinnostuksen kohteisiisi (koska ihmiset, joita seuraat, ovat ihmisiä, joista olet kiinnostunut). Vaikka et matkustaisi, tietäen hyviä paikkoja mennä paikallisesti tai tietäen, että ihmiset, joista olet kiinnostunut, ovat menossa heille, luo mahdollisuuden tavata heidät ja luoda syvempi suhde heidän kanssaan. Jos palaat puoluepostaukseeni, kaikki muut paitsi kaksi, kuulin siitä Twitterissä ja tapasin sitten tosielämässä, ja nyt olemme melko hyviä ystäviä. Ja mitä enemmän teet tätä, sitä enemmän asioita saat selville, ja sitä enemmän ihmisiä tapaat. Ja jos seuraat heitä Twitterissä, tiedät jo hieman siitä, millaisia he ovat. He haluavat sinun olevan. Myös päinvastainen on totta, koska tweeting kutsuu ihmisiä näkemään, millainen olet, ja he voivat tehdä samoja valintoja sinusta.<br/><br/>Inspiraatio ja motivaatio<br/>Inspiraatio tulee mitä kummallisimmista paikoista, ja twiittien tulva tarkoittaa, että mielikuvituksellesi on aina tuoretta sisältöä. Minulla on seuraa ensin -käytäntö, joten seuraan melkein ketä tahansa, ja sitten ajoittain käyn läpi ja jätän ihmiset seuraamatta. En tiedä, kuka istuttaa uuden blogikirjoituksen tai uuden projektin siemenen minuun, joten pidän vaihtoehtoni avoimina. Motivaatiotakin tapahtuu, koska Twitter on kuin elämä. Jos ympäröit itsesi ihmisillä, jotka ovat kunnianhimoisia, omistautuneita, anteliaita ja ahkeria, on helpompaa olla sellainen ja työntää itseäsi. On helpompi ajatella, että jos he voivat suunnitella tapahtumia, käynnistää projekteja tai vain nousta aamulla, niin sinäkin voit.<br/><br/>Oppiminen ja elämäntapa Bloggaajat ovat Twitterissä. Bloggaajat, jotka eivät ole, voivat olla todella hulluja. Ja ihmiset bloggaavat lähes kaikesta. Jos etsit oppia jotain, kertoimet ovat hyvät, että joku twiittaa siitä. Tämän lisäksi myös uutispalvelut ja myymälät ovat yhteydessä toisiinsa, mikä tarkoittaa, että voit saada uutiset jopa minuuttiin, ja selvittää myynnistä ja kaupoista niiden alkaessa. Seuraa joitakin catering-yrityksiä ja katso, mitä he keksivät. Tarvitsetko twistin tuohon cocktail-juhliin? Twitterillä on ihmisiä siihenkin. Vaatekaappisuositukset, vai haluatko vain nähdä, mitä muut ihmiset tekevät hengellään? Kaikki on siellä.<br/><br/>On joitain yhteisiä haasteita, kun puhun tästä, ja ne ovat laillisia esteitä. Se voi tuntua melko pelottavalta, varsinkin jos pääset kelkkaan myöhässä, kuten minä. Seurasin kuukausia vain kahta ihmistä tietämättä, mitä muuta tehdä, - mutta on olemassa keinoja voittaa heidät ja kuulla heidän olevan vähiten toistuvia useimmille.<br/><br/>3. Twitter on narsistisille jerkeille<br/>Luulen, että tämä tulee ajatuksesta, että useimmat ihmiset twiittaavat itsestään ja itsestään keinona saada huomiota. Mitä en saa, on miksi siinä on jotain vikaa, tai miksi sen tekeminen tekee narsistista tai ääliöstä. Jos jollakulla on jotain sanottavaa, he haluavat tulla kuulluksi. Ennen seisoit kadunkulmassa ja huusit. Nyt voit huutaa 140 merkkiä tai vähemmän. Twitter on vain uusi tapa tulla kuulluksi. Nyt Twitterissä on varmasti narsistisia idiootteja. Niitä on melkein kaikkialla, joskus ihmiset ovat idiootteja, joskus yksi heistä olen minä, ikävä kyllä. Jos et pidä siitä, mitä joku sanoo, olivatpa ne sitten pisteitä, joita he tekevät tai yksityiskohtaisia tilejä kylpyhuonetoiminnastaan, sinun ei tarvitse kuunnella Twitterissä.<br/><br/>Alkuperäinen nimi: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>Toinen este, jonka ihmiset usein tuovat esiin, on se, että heillä ei vain ole aikaa seurata kaikkia Twitterissä tapahtuvia asioita. Ja tiedätkö mitä? Se on hienoa. Pidä kirjaa siitä, mitä voit. Ehkä vain vaeltaa muutaman päivän välein. Jos olet yksityinen käyttäjä (sen sijaan, että twiittaisit yrityksellesi) ja erityisesti aloittelija, se on ok. Osa jotain on parempi kuin kaikki mitään.<br/><br/>1. Minulla ei ole mitään mitä haluaisin laittaa sinne<br/>Tämä on ylivoimaisesti yleisin haaste, jonka ihmiset nostavat esiin. Eikä sillä ole edes väliä. Sinun ei tarvitse liittyä Twitteriin puhuaksesi. Liity siihen kuunnellaksesi. Jälleen kerran suosikkikirjailijasi, laulajasi, bloggaajasi ja sanomalehtesi ovat täällä. Tämä on mahdollisuutesi kuunnella heitä. Se on mahdollisuutesi saada ikkuna heidän elämäänsä ja toimintaansa, ja he kutsuvat sinut tekemään sen. Haluatko selvittää, mitä Felicia Day aikoo tehdä San Diego Comic Conissa? Valmis. Tiedän ihmisiä, jotka kuuntelevat vain Twitterissä, ja se on hienoa. Niin tein jonkin aikaa. Lopulta ehkä löydät jotain tweettattavaa, tai tehdä jotain tweettata. Toivon, että teet, koska haluan kuulla siitä.<br/><br/>Lyhyesti sanottuna, jos et käytä Twitteriä, mielestäni sinun pitäisi olla. Jos et käytä sitä täydessä laajuudessaan, yritä. Älä pelkää seurata viittäsataa ihmistä, jos kaikki nämä ihmiset sanovat asioita, joista olet kiinnostunut. Kutsu nuo ihmiset elämäsi palasiksi ja katso, miten vuorovaikutus parantaa sitä. Odotan kuulevani sinusta. |
| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Juurikanaalit<br/><br/>Jo pelkkä ajatus juurikanavan hankkimisesta saa useimmat ihmiset kireälle. SCM Dental hyödyntää uusinta tekniikkaa ja tekniikkaa, jotta juurikanavasta tulisi käytännössä kivuton ja stressitön toimenpide.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontiikka on kehittynyt tekniikka ja tekniikka endodonttisen hoidon suorittamiseksi, juurikanavan kliininen termi Termi "juurikanava" viittaa hampaan keskellä olevaan luonnolliseen onteloon. Hampaan hermo sijaitsee juurikanavan sisällä olevassa pehmytkudoksessa (pulp). Jos hammas vaurioituu joko trauman tai hajoamisen seurauksena, roskat voivat päästä herkälle juurikanavalle ja aiheuttaa infektion, tai äärimmäisissä olosuhteissa, ja paise. Paisehammas on erittäin vakava, ja sitä tulee hoitaa hätätapauksena, sillä se voi aiheuttaa infektion, joka voi levitä muualle elimistöön. Jos uskot, että sinulla on paisehammas, ota välittömästi yhteyttä toimistoomme ensihoidon ajoittamiseksi.<br/><br/>Juurihoito voi tapauksesta riippuen vaatia useamman kuin yhden käyntikerran. Alkuröntgenkuva otetaan hampaan ja juurikanavan arvioimiseksi ja mahdollisen vaurion ja infektion laajuuden määrittämiseksi. Sinulle annetaan anestesian muoto, joka saa sinut rentoutumaan.<br/><br/>Kun alue on tunnoton, hammaslääkärimme luo juurikanavaan pääsykammion käyttämällä sähköistä käsikappaletta. Seuraavaksi juurikanava kaavitaan tartunnan saaneesta tai vaurioituneesta kudoksesta ja hermosta. Kun koko alue on kauttaaltaan puhdistettu ja kiillotettu, hammas täytetään bioyhteensopivalla kumiyhdisteellä, jota kutsutaan gutta perchaksi. Tämän jälkeen hammas peitetään hammastäytteisellä tai hammaskruunulla voiman ja toiminnan palauttamiseksi.<br/><br/>Endodonttisella hoidolla on huono maine kivuliaana toimenpiteenä. Kiertävällä endodontiikalla juurihoito ei ole sen kivuliaampaa kuin hammastäyttö.

| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Kirkonpihan pohjapuu<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Kirkonpihan pohjapuu, Highgate<br/><br/>Nyt nimeltään Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Vuosien 1860 ja 1880 välillä keskus revittiin Lontoon Citystä viemärien, rautateiden ja uusien teiden rakentamiseksi. Talot purettiin välittämättä vuokralaisista, joiden oli löydettävä mitä tahansa majoitusta muualta. Johtajat menivät livoon Kensingtonissa ja St. John's Woodissa, kun taas köyhimmät tungeksivat rookereihin, kuten Seven Dials ja Lisson Grove. Välissä oleville virkailijoille ja taitaville työmiehille spekulatiivinen rakentaja pystytti rivi rivi riviltä rivitaloja ja herra Pooter muutti Hollowayhin. Muswell Hillin asukkaat katselivat talojen hiipimistä Finsbury Parkin peltojen poikki, Crouch Hilliä ylös ja toiselle puolelle, niin että vuoteen 1880 mennessä Crouch End oli kehitteillä eikä virtausta näyttänyt pysäyttävän mikään. Kymmenen vuotta myöhemmin Muswell Hillin suuria tiluksia myytiin. Upton Farm myytiin ja kirkolliset komissaarit halusivat kehittää Churchyard Bottom Woodin, nyt nimeltään Queen's Wood. Tarina olisi tehnyt Ibsenin näytelmän. Kaksi ryhmää rehellisiä, motivoituneita ihmisiä, jotka taistelevat sen puolesta, mitä kumpikin piti oikeana. Yhtäältä kirkolliset komissaarit ja toisaalta Hornseyn hyväntekeväisyysjärjestöjen komitea, molemmat uskoivat tekevänsä parhaansa muiden ihmisten hyväksi, ja yleisö nousi heitä molempia vastaan närkästyneenä<br/><br/>Tuolloin Muswell Hill Road oli maantie, jonka toisessa päässä oli Southwood Hall ja toisessa Upton Farm. Vuoteen 1894 mennessä rakennettiin Onslow Gardens, merkitty Connaught Gardens ja rakentajat olivat valmiita kehittämään Woodlandsin kartanoa. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood oli ryhmä sortuneita mökkejä, kolmion muotoisella paikalla. Kirkollisten komissaarien hallussa olevassa päivättömässä kartassa näkyy kuusi Wasteland Cottagea, joiden välissä on aukko - ei tie, ei metallitettu, vaan tie mansikkasänkyihin takana. Kauempana oli toinen aukko, joka johti polkuihin puun läpi. Näiden kahden aukon piti olla suunnitelman perustana. Samat kaksi aukkoa ja raivattu maa, joka oli mansikkakenttä, näkyy alla olevasta vuoden 1894 kartasta. Ne on esitetty nimellä 'Muswell Hill Cottages' ja melko ohimennen Peter Sellersin oli tarkoitus asua samalla paikalla paljon myöhemmin. Kehittääkseen puuta asuntotilana komissaarien oli ajettava kaksi tietä Muswell Hill Roadin läpi ja rakennettava taloja niiden varrelle. Muswell Hill Roadin julkisivu yksin ei olisi tarjonnut tilaa tarpeeksi taloille, jotta hanke olisi kannattava.<br/><br/>Maa-alueet ja mökit oli annettu paljon aikaisemmin almutaloiksi vanhusten majoittamista varten, ja niitä pitivät puolestaan Hornseyn hyväntekeväisyyskomission jäsenet. 1890-luvulle tultaessa mökit olivat romahtaneet, ja ne tarvitsivat suurta korjausta. Julkisuudenhenkiset, jotka halusivat tehdä parhaansa vanhojen vuokralaistensa hyväksi, johtokuntalaiset eivät voineet parantaa heitä, koska heillä ei ollut rahaa. Joitakin vuosia ennen kuin kirkolliset komissaarit olivat suunnitelleet Gravel Pit Woodin (nykyinen Highgate Wood) kehittämistä asuntotilaksi, mutta tämä oli kohdannut niin suurta vastustusta, että he perääntyivät, vaan vuonna 1886 he antoivat kaikki 69 eekkerin metsämaat yleisölle. Samaan aikaan he tarjoutuivat myymään Churchyard Bottom Woodin Hornseyn kaupunginosaneuvostolle 25 000 punnalla, mutta tämä oli Hornseylle liikaa, jotta hän voisi hankkia sen itse. Neuvosto sanoi, että Hornseyn ulkopuolella asuvat ihmiset nauttivat myös puusta ja muiden viranomaisten pitäisi auttaa, mutta apua ei annettu.<br/><br/>Kartta, jossa näkyy kiistan keskipisteenä olleet Muswell Hillin mökit.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road noin vuonna 1880<br/><br/>Vaikuttaa todennäköiseltä, että nämä kolme mökkiparia olivat kiistan keskiössä.<br/><br/>Kirkolliset komissaarit halusivat kerätä rahaa kirkon työhön Britanniassa ja ulkomailla. He katsoivat, että heille oli annettu maa käytettäväksi uskonnon levittämiseen ja jos tämä merkitsi maan tai metsän myymistä, se oli pienempi paha kuin kirkon työn rajoittaminen. He olivat antaneet Gravel Pit Woodin yleisölle: sen tilalle he kehittäisivät Churchyard Bottom Woodin.<br/><br/>Hornseyn hyväntekeväisyysjärjestöjen johtokunta halusi tuottaa tuloja köyhien ihmistensä auttamiseksi, joten he tekivät tarjouksen komissaareille. Heidän kolmiomainen maapalansa oli liian kömpelösti muotoiltu, jotta sitä olisi voitu kehittää taloudellisesti, mutta jos komissaarit myöntäisivät heille lisää maata tehdäkseen siitä neliömäisen paikan, he rakentaisivat kaksikymmentäviisi siistiä huvilaa. Nämä toisivat 225 punnan vuotuiset maavuokrat, joita voitaisiin käyttää Hornseyn asukkaiden köyhyyden lievittämiseen, ja vastapalveluksena ne antaisivat komission leikata kaksi tietä maansa läpi, jotta komissaarit voisivat kehittää metsiä.<br/><br/>Kun tämä tarjous tuli tunnetuksi, ihmiset reagoivat välittömästi hälytyksellä.<br/><br/>16. joulukuuta 1893 Carvell Williamsin kansanedustaja kysyi alahuoneessa, olivatko kirkolliset komissaarit suostuneet myymään kaistaleen maata Hornsey Charities Trustees'ille sillä ehdolla, että olemassa oleva tie levennettäisiin 40 jalkaan, oliko tämä rakennussuunnitelman esivaihe ja olisiko parlamentilla mahdollisuus ilmaista mielipiteensä.<br/><br/>Leveson Gower, kirkon säätyvaltuutettu vastasi: "Kyllä" ensimmäiseen osaan.<br/><br/>Carvell Williams: "Ymmärränkö, että tarkoituksena on tuhota se osa Highgate Woodsista rakentamalla sille?"<br/><br/>Kaksi päivää myöhemmin The Star julkaisi minkä tahansa nykyaikaisen tabloidin arvoisen artikkelin.<br/><br/>Tähti<br/>18. joulukuuta 1893<br/><br/>"Parlamentin on pidettävä tarkasti silmällä niitä vanhoja vandaaleja ja konfederaatioita, jotka kuuluvat jerryn rakentajalle, kirkollisille komissaareille, jotka vieraannuttavat aina jonkin maapalan tai suosivat rakentajia suuren yleisön sijasta. Komissaarit eivät myisi kirkkopihan pohjapuuta korkojen maksajille, vaan ehdottaisivat nyt "avaamaan sen" leikkaamalla sen läpi kaksi leveää tietä yhden lukuisista rakennushankkeistaan yhteydessä. Eikö kukaan esitä parlamentissa kysymystä ja tarkista komission jäsenten tiili- ja laastipolitiikkaa?"<br/><br/>Kun tämä oli painettu, kysymys oli esitetty ja vastaus oli joko epätosi tai epärehellinen. The Times sanoi pitkässä raportissaan, että Komennusmiehet eivät olleet valmiita antamaan sitoumusta, että parlamentilla tai millään muulla julkisella elimellä olisi mahdollisuus harkita mitä tahansa rakennussuunnitelmaa puun paikalle.<br/><br/>Tilanne kiehui puolitoista vuotta, kunnes kirkolliset komissaarit pakotettiin avaamaan tutkinta, joka alkoi Highgatessa 31. toukokuuta 1895 ja jonka puheenjohtajana toimi kirkollinen apulaiskomissaari. Tutkinta tuotti huumaavia lehtikirjeitä, joista tämä oli tärkein.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5. kesäkuuta 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISMIA KORKEALLA<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>Yksi suburaanien Lontoon ihastuttavimmista metsiköistä on uhattuna, autatko meitä torjumaan sen, mikä olisi katastrofi paitsi lähiseudulle, myös koko tiheästi asutulle Pohjois-Lontoolle? Missään osassa metropolia rakentaja ei ole ollut aktiivisempi kuin Crouch Endissä ja Hornseyssa. Vuoden tai parin takaiset kauniit niityt ovat nykyään taloja ja kauppoja. Painolastikasat ovat ottaneet komeiden jalavien ja kastanjoiden paikan, ja kerran miellyttävät kylät jakavat Stroud Greenin, Harringayn, Finsbury Parkin, Highburyn ja Islingtonin kohtalon.<br/><br/>---- Esine on kahden neljänkymmenen jalan metsän läpi kulkevan tien rakentaminen. Me tässä piirissä tiedämme neljänkymmenen jalan metsän läpi kulkevan tien merkityksen. Se tarkoittaa, että metsät ovat tuhoon tuomittuja. Kymmenen vuotta sitten agitaatio pelasti kuudenkymmenenviiden eekkerin kokoisen sisarpuun - Gravel Pit Woodsin - eikä kukaan, joka näki Bank Holidayn väkijoukon kerääntyvän Archway Roadille Hollowayn, Islingtonin ja Clerkenwellin ankeilta kaduilta, ja katseli lasten ja perhejuhlien nautintaa piknikillä nurmikolla ja puiden seassa, olisi voinut olla tajuamatta sitä valtavaa siunausta, että kuusikymmentä Ecclesia oli koko puuston -----<br/><br/>--- Kirkolliset komissaarit omistavat lähes kolmanneksen Hornseyn suuresta seurakunnasta. Veronmaksajien rahojen vapaalla kulutuksella teiden avaamisessa ja piirin yleisessä kehityksessä heidän omaisuutensa arvo on kasvanut suunnattomasti, ja tästä ansaitsemattomasta lisäyksestä he saavat joka vuosi suuria tuloja. Varmasti ne koronmaksajat, joiden raha on näin auttanut suunnattoman omaisuuden luomisessa, saattavat odottaa vastapalvelukseksi liberaalia kohtelua.<br/><br/>Sinun kuuliaisuutesi,<br/><br/>St Jamesin kirkkoherran, Muswell Hillin, Park Chapelin ministerin, Crouch Endin, Onslow Gardensissa asuvan asianajajan ja kolmen piirineuvoston jäsenen allekirjoittamana.<br/><br/>Se oli laukaus aivan kirkollisten komissaarien jousen yli, heidän omien uskonnollisten johtajiensa ja piirineuvoston, kaikki aseissa sanoen itse asiassa, että kirkko oli liian rikas ja sen tulisi olla hyväntahtoinen, ei ahne. Kahden papin mukaan ottaminen oli ovela siirto. Muista, että tämä oli vielä Darwinin kiistan huipulla. Darwin oli jakanut uskon kirkon opetuksiin ja monet ihmiset olisivat paheksuneet kirkon valtaa pelkästään siitä näkökulmasta. Kirkko ei ollut niin turvallinen kuin se esitti olevansa.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7. kesäkuuta 1895 sanoi:<br/><br/>"Jos kirkollisia kommunisoijia ei heti hoideta, saa rakennusmustekala otteen puusta, jota on myöhemmin hyvin vaikea löysätä, ---. Siksi lontoolaisten kuuluu olla valveilla, jos he pelastaisivat yhden ihastuttavimmista maalaismaisemiaan. Julkinen tutkinta lykkääntyy seuraavaksi torstaiksi, ja sitä ennen on tehtävä jotain, jotta komissaarit saadaan vakuuttuneiksi siitä, etteivät lontoolaiset siedä yhden heidän lempileikkipaikkansa takavarikointia.<br/><br/>Daily Chronicle -lehdessä seuraavana päivänä ollut kirje sanoi:<br/><br/>.... Oli suuri helpotus, että asukkaat, noin kymmenen vuotta sitten, kuulivat Ylämetsän oston tapahtuneen; ja kuinka ihanaksi tämä on osoittautunut, voi jokainen, joka kävi heidän luonaan, todistaa, mutta kaikki, jotka ponnistelivat pelastaakseen nämä ylämetsät, jotka ovat Muswell Hillin tien länsipuolella, kokivat voittonsa epätäydelliseksi niin kauan kuin kuusikymmentä eekkeriä itäpuolella oli vaarassa. On ikään kuin sattumaa, että metsää halkoo leveä korkea tie. Voiko kukaan epäillä, mikä vaikutus olisi, jos kirkonpihan pohjapuu korvattaisiin rivillä pieniä huviloita, joista jokainen lähettää savu- ja nokipanoksensa? Voiko kukaan epäillä myös sitä, kuinka suurta merkitystä sillä olisi ostetun metsän maalaukselliselle asetelmalle, jos rivi uusia tuijottavia taloja ajettaisiin suoraan niiden vehreää julkisivua vasten?"<br/><br/>Tämä ilmaisi monien ihmisten mielipiteitä. Itse asiassa Gravel Pit Woodia, jota kirjoittaja kutsuu "yläpuuksi", ei ollut ostettu, vaan se oli annettu piirille kirkollisen komission toimesta, minkä kohdan heidän oli määrä toistaa kerta toisensa jälkeen vuosien varrella, mutta useimmat ihmiset jättivät sen huomiotta. Komissio ei aikonut antaa pois toista puuta, mitä tahansa joku sanoi, ja piti tämän kannan loppuun asti.<br/><br/>5. Cranley Gardensin H.S.Chamberlain kehotti 8. kesäkuuta 1895 päivätyssä kirjeessään Timesia ostamaan.<br/><br/>Tiedän, että on tavallista puhua tylysti kirkollisista komissaareista, mutta pienen rahaston hoitajina he ovat velvollisia hallinnoimaan sitä suurimpana etuna, ja siksi, jos jotain aiotaan tehdä puun purkamisen pelastamiseksi, minusta näyttää siltä, että se voidaan toteuttaa vain ostamalla kiinteistö kommunisteilta, jotka tiedän, olisivat täysin elossa vapaiden ja avoimien tilojen suojelemiseksi ihmisille, jotka olisivat valmiita<br/><br/>(Tämä viittaa Crouch End -pelikenttiin, jotka oli turvattu muutamaa vuotta myöhemmin.)<br/><br/>Muswell Hillin konservatiiviyhdistyksen puheenjohtajana olen jatkuvasti yhteydessä asukkaisiin, ja voin turvallisesti vakuuttaa, että jokainen naapuruston asukas tekisi mitä tahansa säilyttääkseen.<br/><br/>(Hän halusi henkilökohtaisesti vain hyväntekeväisyystuloja köyhän kansansa elättämiseen. Hän vaati eekkerin maataan - ei kovinkaan varmasti - hän uskoi komissaarien vakuutteluihin siitä, että puu ei ollut vaarassa.)<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road oli yksi Hornseyn parhaista ja pysyisi yhtä kauniina, oli taloja tai ei.<br/><br/>(Ja sitten tuli suuri retorinen kukoistus.)<br/><br/>Köyhien on kärsittävä sentimentaalisten vastalauseiden ja kirjeenvaihtajien juuri nostaman suden hysteerisen huudon takia. Ekreetti hyväntekeväisyysrahastoon lisätystä takamaasta ei olisi mitään merkityksellistä jäljellä olevalle maalle, kun taas siitä saatu voitto auttaisi monia köyhiä vanhoja ja ansioituneita henkilöitä heidän taantuvina vuosinaan ja mahdollistaisi sen, että voisimme luovuttaa seuraajillemme kartanon, joka kaukaisessa tulevaisuudessa olisi suuriarvoinen hyväntekeväisyysavun antamisessa Hornseyn seurakunnan ansioituneille köyhille.»<br/><br/>Hänen kirjeensä lukeminen aistii hysterian hyvin lähellä pintaa. Miksi hän ajatteli, että komissaarit halusivat rakentaa tien? Miksi heidän pitäisi käyttää kaikki rahat, ellei rakentaa taloja? Hän ei koskaan näyttänyt tajuavan, että hehtaarin maa-alalta koko puu menetettäisiin, mutta hän oli ollut ongelman kanssa jo pitkään. Hän oli se henkilö, jolle komissaarit olivat tehneet myyntitarjouksen 25 000 vuotta aiemmin, ja juuri hänen nimeään kunnioitetaan Crouchin kellotornin laatassa puun pelastamisesta, mutta hänen luottamuksensa kirkollisiin komissaareihin vaikuttaa naiivilta. Surullista, että Tutkinnassa hänet oli määrä esittää paholaisena.<br/><br/>Tutkinta jatkui<br/><br/>Keskeytetty kokous avattiin Highgatessa 15. kesäkuuta 1895. Odotettaessa suurta kokoontumista neuvoston istuntosalia oli muutettu kokonaan. Tavalliset pöydät oli poistettu ja huone täytetty tuoleilla. Puoli seitsemältä huone oli täpötäynnä, ja ihmiset tönivät istuimia.<br/><br/>Poliisipäällikkö Murrayn mukaan tutkinta oli todella yksinkertainen: Hornsey Parochial Charities halusi ostaa hyväntekeväisyyskiinteistönsä viereisen maa-alueen. Kysymys kuului, oliko kaikkia hyväntekeväisyysjärjestöjä hallinneella hyväntekeväisyyskomissiolla tarpeeksi valtaa pysäyttää heidät. Kirkon komissaarit olivat valmiita myymään maan hyvin suotuisin ehdoin, ja hyväntekeväisyysjärjestön tulot kasvaisivat hyvin huomattavasti.<br/><br/>Tätä vastaan oli kolmenlaisia vastaväitteitä.<br/><br/>Alkuperäisen Trustin tarkoituksena oli tarjota mökkejä köyhille, mutta luottamusmiehet ehdottivat rakennettavaksi huviloita, jotka olisivat liian kalliita köyhille. Luottamusmiesten vallassa oli kuitenkin vaihdella Trustin ehtoja, jotta he voisivat rakentaa huviloita, jos he ajattelisivat, että köyhät hyötyisivät lopulta. Köyhät itse saattaisivat vastustaa, mutta heille oli jo luvattu liberaaleja määräyksiä, kolmas vastalause liittyi kysymyksen esteettiseen ja julkiseen puoleen. Hän otti lukemastaan, että hyväntekeväisyyskomission tulisi puuttua asiaan estääkseen kirkollisia komissaareita käyttämästä omaa harkintavaltaansa oman omaisuutensa käsittelyssä.<br/><br/>Tutkinnassa keskusteltiin hienoista kohdista, mutta puhujat palasivat jatkuvasti puun tuhoutumisen estämiseen liittyvään suureen ongelmaan. Islingtonin Vestry Clerk, joka edusti 300 000 ihmistä, teki muodollisen protestin mistä tahansa osasta puuta, joka oli niin arvokasta Islingtonin ja Hornseyn ihmisille, että sitä käytettiin yksityisiin tarkoituksiin. Wilfred White sanoi, että jos komissaarit antaisivat heille aikaa, he voisivat kerätä rahat kostaakseen johtokunnalle.<br/><br/>Beaumont sanoi, että he eivät halunneet huviloita, vaan mökkejä köyhille, jotka ajettiin pois kaupunginosasta. Toiset sanoivat, että mökkien rakentamiseen ei ollut rahaa nykyisten rappeutuneiden tilalle, mutta huvilat olisivat taloudellinen ehdotus. Toiset toistelivat, että Highgateen oli päästettävä useita huviloita. Puu oli pyhä. Kiinnittäkää huomiota kysymykseen puusta.<br/><br/>Tohtori Fletcher sanoi, että työläisten keskuudessa kuului huuto, ettei ollut paikkaa minne mennä. Työläiset tulivat hänen luokseen huutaen: "Meidät ajetaan pois Highgatesta ja meidän on pakko mennä Highgate New Towniin." Jos Muswell Hill Roadin julkisivu myytiin, ei ollut epäilystäkään siitä, että tiet saatettaisiin leikata suoraan metsän läpi Hornseyn suuntaan, mutta jos komissaarit eivät saaneet maata Hyväntekeväisyyskomissiolta, he eivät voineet leikata tietä.<br/><br/>Hän oli hyvin varma, että mökit saataisiin kuntoon. Köyhä kansa, poliisi ja useat työväenluokat pyysivät häntä edustamaan näitä kahta seikkaa, että mökkimajoitusta tarvittiin Highgatessa kipeästi ja että jos he kerran sallivat maan myynnin, ei ollut mitään tietoa, missä rakentajan käsi majailisi.<br/><br/>(Voimakkaita ja pitkittyneitä hurraahuutoja).<br/><br/>Lukuisat muut ihmiset puhuivat ja Komentaja tiivisti sanomalla, että hän otti sen, että vallitseva mielipide kannatti mökkien säilyttämistä, mutta kokouksen ei pitäisi tehdä johtopäätöksiä siitä, mitä hän oli sanonut (Groans).<br/><br/>Toiset sanoivat, että Charityn luottamushenkilöt olivat epäonnistuneet tehtävissään antamalla mökkien joutua huonoon kuntoon.<br/><br/>H. R. Williams, luottamusmies, joka oli kirjoittanut lehteen aiemmin, sanoi, että hänellä oli paras valta, että kirkon komissaarit eivät tekisi mitään teitä ja heille ei koituisi hitustakaan hyötyä hyväntekeväisyyskomission jäsenten toimista. Toiset olivat paljon vähemmän luottavaisia ja kokous päättyi lähes kolmen tunnin kuluttua.<br/><br/>"Meillä on edessämme se tosiasia, että Highgatessa ja Muswell Hillissä on joukko ihmisiä, jotka haluavat Churchyard Bottom Woodin eivätkä tule olemaan onnellisia ennen kuin ovat saaneet sen - samalla kun kukaan ei näytä olevan halukas kuluttamaan mitään maksaakseen siitä. Kaikki sanovat, että olisi hienoa, jos puu olisi avoimena tilana, mutta kaikki ajattelevat, että on jonkun toisen velvollisuus tehdä siitä sellainen. Islington Vestry on "ratkaissut" asian, mutta Islington Vestry ei tarjoa penniäkään ostettavaksi. --- Yhteisön tai yksilön ratkaistavana ei ole vaikeampaa ongelmaa kuin se, miten saada muiden ihmisten omaisuus haltuunsa maksamatta siitä."<br/><br/>Maksaminen oli todellakin ongelma, kun Churchyard Bottom Woodista tuli kiihkeän paikallisen ja kansallisen keskustelun aihe. Muodostettiin yhteiskomitea, joka keräsi rahaa puun säästämiseksi. 20. marraskuuta 1896 C.F. Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, kirjoitti The Standard -lehteen, joka oli tuolloin päivälehti, pyytäen apua. Hän muistutti kaikkia puun menettämisen vaarasta ja sanoi, että se voitaisiin pelastaa vain ostamalla se. Kirkon komissaarit myivät 25 000 punnalla ja ylimääräisellä (5 000 puntaa tarvittaisiin miekkailuun ja salaojitukseen, mikä tekee yhteensä 30 000 puntaa. Tämä oli Hornseyn kirkolliskokoukselle liikaa korotettavaksi, mutta he olivat jo äänestäneet 10 000 puntaa kokonaissummaa kohti. Metsät olivat mittaamattoman arvokkaita koko Pohjois-Lontoolle, joten hän vetosi julkisiin elimiin ja yksityisiin ihmisiin, jotta nämä nostaisivat jäljelle jääneet 20 000 puntaa. Hän varoitti, että nykyinen kirkon komissaarien tarjous oli avoinna vain vuoden 1898 loppuun asti. Tämän jälkeen rakentajat siirtyisivät<br/><br/>Vetoomus otettiin lehdistössä lämpimästi vastaan. Eduskunnan läpi kiiruhti yksityinen lakiesitys ja Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, tuli laiksi. Conunitteella oli nyt oikeus mainostaa lahjoituksia puun ostamiseen ja säilyttämiseen.<br/><br/>Melko lyhyessä ajassa lähes kaikki rahat saatiin kerättyä, mutta viimeiset pari tuhatta osoittautuivat hyvin vaikeiksi kerätä ja komission jäsenten määräaikaan oli enää viikkoja. Cory-Wright kirjoitti anovansa lisäaikaa, mutta hänelle myönnettiin vain kolme kuukautta ja silloinkin vain, jos lisäajasta maksettiin korkoa 4 prosenttia täydellä summalla. Lopulta Lontoon kreivikunnanvaltuusto, joka oli alun perin tarjonnut 2 500 puntaa, teki tästä jopa 5 000 puntaa ja kokonaissumma saavutettiin, mutta se oli läheltä piti -juttu.<br/><br/>Neuvosto päätti nimetä Puun uudelleen "kuningattaren puuksi" kuningatar Viktorian timanttijuhlan kunniaksi ja Hornsey pani hienon pullannäytöksen, kun Albanyn herttuatar julisti Puun virallisesti avoimeksi "yleisön vapaaseen käyttöön ikuisesti".<br/><br/>Samalla kun kampanjaa Churchyard Bottom Woodin pelastamiseksi johtivat ja ohjasivat paikalliset ihmiset, jotka tunsivat intohimoa tätä tiettyä metsämaata kohtaan, he pyysivät apua ja kokemusta laajalta ihmisverkostolta, joista osa oli työskennellyt yhdessä samankaltaisten kampanjoiden parissa yli kolmenkymmenen vuoden ajan. Komitea antoi vetoomuksen, joka painettiin erittäin hyvälaatuiselle paperille ja jossa oli joitakin kuuluisia nimiä.<br/><br/>Avoimen tilan ja kansanterveyden kysymykset olivat viktoriaanisen vision pääaiheita.<br/><br/>Avoimet tilat -liike<br/><br/>Jolm Ruskinin hänelle ostamasta suuresta asuntouudistajasta Octavia Hillistä, joka oli aloittanut kolmella vanhalla talolla Marylebonessa, oli nopeasti tullut köyhien ihmisten asumisen asiantuntija terveimmissä olosuhteissa. Hänen tapansa oli ostaa vuokrasopimuksia ja sitten kaataa joitakin täpötäynnä olevia taloja tuodakseen valoa ja ilmaa muille uskoen, että raikas ilma ja auringonvalo olivat ainoa keino pelastaa köyhät 'putrid-kuumeelta. Hän oli oppinut tämän jo lapsena isoisältään Southwood Smithiltä, joka kehitti teoriansa King's Crossin kuumesairaalassa.<br/><br/>Hän oli rakentanut ensimmäiset teollisuusasunnot köyhille ja osoittanut tilastollisesti, että hyvä ilma ja kunnollinen kuivatus pelastivat ihmishenkiä. Gibson Gardens, Northwold Road, on suora seuraus Southwood Smithin ideoista.<br/><br/>Avoimen ilman merkitys<br/><br/>Avoimet tilat ja mahdollisuus hengittää puhdasta ilmaa olivat välttämättömiä yhdessä tai kahdessa ahtaassa huoneessa asuville ihmisille. Octavia Hill vei hänen latauksensa Lisson Groven slummeista, Fitzjohn's Avenuelta Hampstead Heathiin. Hän rakasti Fitzjohn's Avenuen peltoja niin paljon, että yritti ostaa ne yleiseksi puistoksi, jonka piti maksaa 10 000 puntaa ja kolmen elokuun viikon kuluessa oli korotettu 8 500 puntaa. Siihen tarvittiin vain kesäloman loppu ja paluu sympaattisten ystävien lomalta ja vielä 1 500 puntaa olisi nostettu, mutta omistajat vetivät yllättäen tarjouksensa pois. Kaikesta anomisesta huolimatta pellot peittyivät suuriin taloihin.<br/><br/>Tästä kehittyi kampanja parlamentin Hillin pelastamiseksi, seuraava avoin tila pohjoiseen päin Lisson Grovesta, ostaen kentät rakentajien polulta pysyvän cordon sanitalren tekemiseksi eteneviä tiiliä vastaan. Parliament Hill Fields -kampanja oli niin menestyksekäs, että Hampstead Heath Bill hyväksyttiin ja vetoomuksesta saatiin rahaa. Tästä rahasta ja sysäyksestä kohti avoimia tiloja oli kehitettävä National Trust. Octavia Hill oli jo vuosia ollut kiinnostunut Church Bottom Woodin kaltaisten alueiden suojelusta, joten hän oli luonnollinen liittolainen taistelussa Woodin pelastamiseksi.<br/><br/>Myös Commons Preservation Society oli perehtynyt tällaiseen agitaatioon ja rahankeräykseen. He olivat repineet maahan miekkailun, kun kartanonherrat olivat sulkeneet sisäänsä yhteismaan palasia, johtaen sekä laillisia että laittomia taisteluita perinteisesti vapaata maan ylimielistä yksityistämistä vastaan. Robert Hunter, heidän kunniaasianajajansa vuodelta 1868, huolehti aina avoimien tilojen, suurten tai pienten, turvaamisesta yleisölle. Hänestä, nyt Sir Robert Hunterista, tuli Church Bottom Appealin puheenjohtaja. Commons Preservation Societyn puheenjohtaja oli Shaw-Lefevre MP (myöhemmin Lord Eversley), joka näytteli suurta osaa tässä ja muissa alahuoneen kampanjoissa. Octavia Hill oli ollut mukana heidän työssään noin vuodesta 1875.<br/><br/>Samaan aikaan Octavia Hill kampanjoi Burials Billin puolesta.<br/><br/>Kaupungin kirkkopihat olivat tulleet niin täyteen ja niin vakavaksi vaaraksi terveydelle, saastuttamalla kaivoja, joista ihmiset vetivät juomavetensä, että kaupungin hautauksia ei enää sallittu, vaan hautausmaat luotiin kaupungin laitamille. Abney Parkin hautausmaa oli yksi näistä. Silloin tehtiin liike, jonka tarkoituksena oli poistaa hautakivet vanhankaupungin hautausmaiden reunoilta, liittää ruumiit uudelleen muualle ja muuttaa hautausmaat puutarhoiksi ja avoimiksi tiloiksi niiden päälle rakentamisen sijaan. Tämä maa-alue Lontoon keskustassa oli hyvin arvokas ja keinottelijat olivat innokkaita saamaan sen: kveekaritkin olivat rakentaneet yhden hautausmaansa yli ja uhkasivat tehdä sen uudelleen rakentamalla Bunhill Fieldsin yli. Octavia Hillillä oli liittolaisverkosto kymmenellä kentällä, joten hänen apunsa kirkon pohjapuun pelastamisessa oli varmasti korvaamatonta.<br/><br/>Vuonna 1882 perustettu Metropolitan Gardens Society oli vuoteen 1890 mennessä pystyttänyt noin kaksisataa pientä puutarhaa kaupunkien keskustoihin. Myöhemmin ne luovutettiin paikallisille viranomaisille, joten niiden tuki Churchyard Bottom Wood Appealille oli varmistettu alusta alkaen.<br/><br/>Kyrle-seura on nyt unohdettu, mutta sillä oli aikanaan suuri vaikutus kaupunkisuunnitteluun ja avoimiin tiloihin liittyvään lainsäädäntöön. Seura oli perustettu noin vuonna 1875 "kauneuden diffuusiota" varten, tuomaan väriä ja mielenkiintoa tylsässä, ankeassa ympäristössä asuvien ihmisten elämään. Kirkas väri seiniin ja koristeluun, hyvään lauluun, avoimiin tiloihin, luontoon, kirjallisuuteen ja taiteeseen. Kaikki nämä kuuluivat seuran toimialaan: siellä oli koristeosasto, jota varten William Morris luennoi; musiikkiosasto, joka promotoi kuoroja ja iloisia iltoja paikallisissa koulurakennuksissa oleville ihmisille; ja kirjallisuusosasto. Seura vetosi säännöllisesti The Times -lehden kirjeillä "rikkaampiin luokkiin", jotta kirjoja ja aikakauslehtiä jaettaisiin poikien ja tyttöjen klubeille, almutaloihin ja muualle. Jo nimi "Kyrle" tuli Pope's The Man of Rossista, filantrooppista, joka antoi syntymäpaikkansa ihmisille julkisena puistona. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life.

Ja olen jälleen kiitollinen miehelleni Edille, että hän teki kaiken clipartin minulle.<br/><br/>Kiitospäivän kaavan tekeminen<br/><br/>Kuten nimikin kertoo, tässä pelissä on kyse kuvioiden tekemisestä. Pikkuiset vain oppivat kuvioista, voivat yksinkertaisesti sovittaa kuvat kuvioliuskoille, kun taas toiset voivat jatkaa kuviota tyhjien liuskojen kuvakorteilla.<br/><br/>Jos haluat tehdä tiedostokansion, haluat leikata kuvien ruudukon korttikappaleiden tekemiseksi. Suosittelen laminoimaan ne, jotta ne kestävät pidempään. Sitten liimaa kuvioliuskat alas tiedostokansioon.<br/><br/>Halusin saada myös tyhjät kuvioliuskat, jotta tytöt näkisivät, mihin kuviota tulisi jatkaa ja kuinka monta. Kiinnitin ne kansion kylkeen teipillä, jotta he voisivat taittaa sisään pakatakseen pelin ja laajentaakseen kuvion asetteluun.<br/><br/>Lisäsin myös ylimääräisen tyhjän, jotta tytötkin voisivat tehdä oman kuvionsa.<br/><br/>Turkin numeropeli<br/><br/>Tässä pelissä tytöt lisäävät höyhenet kalkkunan vartaloon harjoitellessaan laskemista ja numerontunnistusta. Käytin värittömiä höyheniä ohjenuorana höyhenten lisäämisessä ja niin, että tytöt pystyivät vastaamaan numeroita. Ja olla varma, kun liimaamalla alas kalkkunan runko vain liimaa keskellä niin, että siipikappaleet voivat liukua kehon alle.<br/><br/>Kun kaikki höyhenet on laskettu, harjoittelemme jotain yksinkertaista aritmetiikkaa, kuten kolmen höyhenen ottamista pois ja sen näkemistä, kuinka monta on jäljellä, ja sitten lisäämme kaksi takaisin nähdäksemme, mitä se vastaa.<br/><br/>Mustavalkoisten siipien lisäksi mukana oli myös väritön kalkkuna siltä varalta, että haluat pienten värittävän oman settinsä. Tiedostokansiopelin sijaan voit muuttaa tämän askarteluksi, värittää palaset, leikata ne pois ja liimata ne yhteen.<br/><br/>Toinen vaihtoehto on käyttää kappaleita huopataulutarinan tekemiseen.

| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | Alle 21-vuotiaiden alkoholinkäyttö on todettu merkittäväksi kansanterveydelliseksi ongelmaksi. Tutkimusten mukaan se lisää vammaisuuden riskiä ja voi olla haitallista kehittyville aivoille. Alaikäiset, jotka juovat, tekevät todennäköisemmin itsemurhan, rikkovat lakia tai joutuvat väkivallan uhreiksi. Alkoholi on osallisena lähes kolmasosassa nuorten liikennekuolemista. Alaikäisten alkoholinkäytön vuosittaisten kokonaiskustannusten arvioidaan olevan 62 miljardia dollaria. Vaikka useimmat lait, joiden tarkoituksena on estää alaikäisten juominen, hyväksytään osavaltion tasolla, liittovaltion tasolla on ollut lainsäädännöllistä toimintaa ja kiinnostusta tukea valtioiden pyrkimyksiä hillitä ongelmaa. Raportissa kuvataan alaikäisen alkoholin käytön laajuutta, viimeaikaista lainsäädäntötyötä tässä asiassa ja erilaisia poliittisia vaikutuksia. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives?

The unique outer crispiness of the meat gave way to a perfectly juicy interior, resulting in a sound more similar to slicing into a calzone than a ground beef patty.<br/><br/>We were sitting in Copenhagen's oldest pub, which felt more like a casual bistro than a bar, and I was about to try the dish recommended by our waitress/bar tender/proprietor?<br/><br/>"The Paris Beef, it's very good," she had said. "It's not from France… it's very Danish."<br/><br/>Sign me up!<br/><br/>Paris beef with fresh veggies and raw egg yolk at Rabes Have in Copenhagen | Tag Archives: oikea ruoka<br/><br/>Viime viikolla kirjoitin pohjoismaisesta ruokamanifestista ja siitä, kuinka Tanska loi vahvan "oikean ruoan" kulttuurin pitkälti Claus Meyerin johtaman tahallisen pyrkimyksen pohjalta. Se ei ollut poliittinen lobbaus tai julkinen vetoomus, joka johti elintarvikeuudistukseen, vaan pikemminkin kansalaisten johtama ruohonjuuritason pyrkimys, jolla on valta todella toteuttaa ja seurata muutosta.<br/><br/>Päätin viran viitaten yhteen kysymykseen: Miksi meidän on niin vaikea tehdä tämä itse, yksilöinä? Jos kokonainen maa voi toteuttaa ja levittää yhteistä näkemystä ruokaan, miksi emme voi?<br/><br/>Mikään ei oikeastaan estä meitä matkimasta Tanskan menestystä, mutta ongelmana on, että meillä on niin paljon viestejä siitä, mitä meidän pitäisi syödä, ja miten meidän pitäisi elää, että on vaikea tietää mistä aloittaa. Niinpä sen sijaan, että seurattaisiin onnistuneita kehyksiä, joiden on osoitettu toimivan (kuten Nordic Food Manifesto), useimmat ihmiset hyppäävät ruokavaliohulluudesta ruokavaliohulluuteen yrittäen löytää "oikean tavan syödä".<br/><br/>Mutta miten Claus Meyer onnistui? Mikä oli salainen kastike, joka auttoi Manifestin tarttumaan? Ja onko järkevää ajatella, että voimme soveltaa näitä oppitunteja omaan elämäämme?
