In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Online CPR -sertifiointiblogi<br/><br/>Päivämäärä: 23.7.2014<br/><br/>Autosomaalinen hallitseva interstitiaalinen munuaissairaus on harvinainen kokoelma sairauksia, jotka vaikuttavat munuaisten tunnettuihin toimintoihin.

| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Hobbesin vs. Locken kertomus luonnon tilasta<br/><br/>Topic: FilosofiaSanat: 2539Sivut: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes ja Locke ovat vaikutusvaltaisimpia englanninkielisiä poliittisia filosofeja. Monimutkaisten yhteiskuntien organisaatiota edeltävä luonnontila on yhteinen lähtökohta, jota sekä Hobbes että Locke jakavat, mutta tulkitsevat eri tavoin. Entiset pitävät ihmisiä luonnollisessa tilassaan yhtä vaarallisina ja vapaina tavoittelemaan egoistisia päämääriään, joita eivät rajoita olemassa olevat oikeudenmukaisuuden käsitteet, minkä vuoksi hänen luonnollinen tilansa merkitsee "jokaisen ihmisen sotaa jokaista ihmistä vastaan" (Hobbes76). Jälkimmäinen taas pitää ihmisiä alkuperäisessä tilassaan yhtä arvokkaina ja rajoittaa luonnollista vapautta ajatuksella oikeudenmukaisuudesta, joka vaatii olemaan vahingoittamatta muita, mikä mahdollistaa luonnontilan määrittelemisen "keskinäiseksi avuksi ja säilyttämiseksi" sodan sijaan (Locke 15). Keskeinen ero kahden filosofin luonnontilaa koskevien tilien välillä on se, että Locke käyttää eettisiä näkökohtia, kun taas Hobbes ei, ja se johtaa lopulta Hobbesin kuvittelemaan valtion, joka käyttää rajoittamatonta valtaa ihmisiin, kun taas Locke rajoittaa hallitusta moraalisilla periaatteilla, joita hän pitää luonnollisena lakina.<br/><br/>Hobbes perustaa luonnontilaa koskevat olettamuksensa siihen, että kaikki ihmiset ovat suurin piirtein yhtäläisiä fyysisiltä ja henkisiltä kyvyiltään. Hän myöntää, että jotkut yksilöt saattavat osoittaa suurempaa fyysistä voimaa tai korkeampaa älykkyyttä, mutta vaatii, että "kun kaikki lasketaan yhteen, ero ihmisen ja ihmisen välillä ei ole niin huomattava" (Hobbes 74). Koska ihmiset ovat kyvyiltään suurin piirtein tasa-arvoisia, heillä on myös samanlaisia toiveita saavuttaa päämääränsä ja tyydyttää tarpeensa (Hobbes 75). Loogisena tuloksena tästä tasa-arvosta, kun ihmiset alkavat kilpailla niukoista resursseista, kukaan ei välttämättä tunne oloaan täysin turvalliseksi omaisuutensa suhteen. Vaikka mahtava, ovela ja kyvykäs henkilö onnistuu alistamaan "kaikkien ihmisten henkilöt, jotka hän pystyy", se ei silti takaa lopullista turvallisuutta (Hobbes 75). Koska kukaan ihminen ei voi saavuttaa sellaista ylemmyyttä muihin nähden, joka tekee hänet täysin immuuniksi heidän älynsä voimakkuudelle, kukaan ihminen ei voi tuntea oloaan täysin turvalliseksi vertaistensa ympäröimänä. Hobbesin tasa-arvo luonnontilassa on pelon tasa-arvo, jossa kaikki ihmiset pitävät toisiaan vaarallisina kilpailijoina.<br/><br/>Aivan kuten Hobbes, Locke pitää kaikkia ihmisiä pohjimmiltaan tasa-arvoisina, mutta antaa termille hyvin erilaisen merkityksen. Hänen näkökulmastaan kyse ei ole kyvykkyyksien tasa-arvosta, vaan pikemminkin arvon tasa-arvosta. Hän arvelee, että ihmisten, jotka "syntyvät vapaasti kaikkiin samoihin luonnon etuihin", tulisi loogisesti nauttia täydellisestä tasa-arvosta heidän keskuudessaan, koska ei ole mitään syytä pitää ketään luonnostaan arvokkaampana (Locke 8). Ainoa mahdollinen perusta joidenkin ihmisten nimittämiselle muita korkeammaksi olisi, jos Jumala "minkä tahansa tahdon ilmeisen julistuksen kautta asettaisi yhden toisen yläpuolelle" (Locke 8). Koska tällainen jumalallinen ylemmyydentunnustus puuttuu, Locke päättelee, että ihmiskunnan kaikkien edustajien luonnollista tasa-arvoa ei saa asettaa kyseenalaiseksi. Hobbes lähestyy tasa-arvoa pragmaattisesti ja korostaa, että ihmiset luonnollisessa tilassaan ovat yhtä vaarallisia, mutta Locke käyttää eettistä lähestymistapaa ja korostaa, että ihmiset ovat yhtä arvokkaita Jumalan silmissä. Tämä erimielisyys on vain ensimmäinen ero näiden kahden kirjoittajan välillä, joka perustuu siihen, että Locke sisällyttää Jumalan lähtökohtana poliittiseen filosofiaansa, kun taas Hobbes ei.<br/><br/>Toinen Hobbesin luonnontilan kuvaukselle ominainen piirre on hänen tulkintansa vapaudesta. Hobbesin mukaan luonnontila merkitsee rajoittamatonta vapautta tehdä mitä tahansa, mikä on välttämätöntä ihmisen olemassaolon jatkumiselle. Filosofi määrittelee vapauden "ulkoisten esteiden puuttumiseksi" käyttäessään kykyjään saavuttaakseen päämääränsä (Hobbes 79). Jokaisen aistivan olennon ensisijainen tarkoitus on ylläpitää jatkuvaa olemassaoloaan. Tämän seurauksena hobbesilainen vapaus merkitsee esteetöntä mahdollisuutta tehdä mitä tahansa, mikä ihmisen mielestä sopisi parhaiten hänen elämänsä ja omaisuutensa säilyttämiseen (Hobbes 79). Ainoa rajoite vapaudelle on se, että ihminen ei voi tehdä mitään ristiriitaista ylläpitääkseen elämäänsä tai tuhotakseen "keinot säilyttääkseen sen" (Hobbes 79). Sen lisäksi ei ole rajoja, ja jokaisella on "oikeus kaikkeen, jopa toistensa kehoon", jos se edistää selviytymistä (Hobbes 80). Näin ollen luonnollinen vapaus on Hobbesin näkemyksen mukaan sitä, ettei ole olemassa ulkoisesti pakotettuja esteitä, jotka estävät ihmistä tavoittelemasta oikeuttaan kaikkeen ylläpitääkseen ja turvatakseen olemassaolonsa jatkumisen.<br/><br/>Locke kannattaa myös luonnollisen vapauden ajatusta, mutta yllättäen lähestyy sitä tavalla, joka on merkittävästi erilainen kuin Hobbesin. Heti kun hän alkaa keskustella vapaudesta luonnontilassa, hän toteaa heti, että vapauden tila ei rinnasta "lisenssitilaa" (Locke 9). Filosofi tunnistaa kaksi erityistä rajoitusta ihmisen vapaudelle luonnontilassa. Ensimmäinen on identtinen Hobbesin esittelemän kanssa: olipa henkilö kuinka vapaa ja itsenäinen tahansa, hänellä "ei kuitenkaan ole vapautta tuhota itseään" (Locke 9). Kuitenkin toinen rajoitus on ristiriidassa Hobbesin prepositioiden kanssa suoraan. Locken mukaan jokaisella ihmisellä on luonnollinen velvollisuus olla "vahingoittamatta toista hänen elämässään, terveydessään, vapaudessaan tai omaisuudessaan" (9). Aivan kuten hänen tulkintansa tasa-arvosta, kirjoittaja perustaa tämän väitteen eettisiin ja uskonnollisiin perusteisiin: ihmisten tulisi säilyttää toistensa olemassaolo, koska ne ovat kaikki saman "kaikkivoivan ja äärettömän viisaan luojan" luomuksia (Locke 9). Niinpä Locke rajoittaa vapautta luonnollisessa tilassa paljon tiukemmin kuin Hobbes ottamalla käyttöön velvollisuuden pidättäytyä vahingoittamasta sekä itseään että muita.<br/><br/>Näiden kahden tekijän väliset erot ilmenevät myös heidän kertomuksissaan oikeudenmukaisuudesta ihmiskunnan luonnollisessa tilassa. Hobbesin osalta oikeudenmukaisten ja epäoikeudenmukaisten käytäntöjen rajaaminen on vain lakikysymys. Luonnontilassa ei ole oikeuskäytäntöä, ja ainoa laki, joka hallitsee ihmistä alkuperäisessä tilassaan, on luonnonlaki, joka vain velvoittaa häntä etsimään henkilökohtaista turvallisuutta. Tämän seurauksena mikään ei voi olla epäoikeudenmukaista ihmiskunnan alkuperäisessä tilassa: "oikean ja väärän oikeuden ja epäoikeudenmukaisuuden käsitteillä" ei ole sijaa eikä merkitystä tiukan täytäntöönpannun lain puuttuessa (Hobbes 78). Niin kauan kuin ihmiset käyttävät käytännöllisesti katsoen rajatonta vapauttaan kilpailla häikäilemättömästi keskenään resursseista, joihin heillä on yhtäläinen oikeus, heillä ei ole kriteerejä tehdä eroa oikeudenmukaisen ja epäoikeudenmukaisen toiminnan välillä. Näin ollen hobbesilainen luonnontila uhmaa oikeuden ideaa, sillä kirjoittaja tulkitsee sen pelkäksi muodollistetun ja vakiintuneen lain funktioksi.<br/><br/>Locke antaa oikeudenmukaisuudelle eri merkityksen ja katsoo sitä niin lainsäädännöllisesti kuin eettisestikin. Tässä artikkelissa mainittiin jo, että toisin kuin Hobbes, Locke käyttää eettisiä käsitteitä ja yleensä perustaa poliittisen filosofiansa pikemminkin moraalisiin kuin puhtaasti käytännöllisiin olettamuksiin. Locken luonnonlaki, toisin kuin Hobbesin, velvoittaa ihmiset huolehtimaan toisistaan sen sijaan, että yksinkertaisesti jättäisivät kaikki huolehtimaan itsestään. Tämän seurauksena hänen luonnontilassaan on paikka oikeudenmukaisuudelle ja epäoikeudenmukaisuudelle. Kirjoittaja viittaa tähän itse huomauttaessaan, ettei kenenkään tule riistää toiselta hänen elämäänsä sen säilyttämiskeinoista "ellei sitten tehdä oikeutta rikoksentekijälle" (Locke 9). Tämä toteamus paljastaa äärimmäisen selvästi, että Locken mukaan luonnontilassa on oikeudenmukaisuutta, ja lisäksi ihmisten on säilytettävä se aktiivisesti. Oikeudenmukaisuuden kriteeri, jota Hobbesin luonnontilalta puuttuu, on toinen Locken asettama luonnollisen vapauden rajoitus: teko on epäoikeudenmukainen, jos se muodostaa perusteettoman uhan toisen ihmisen elämälle ja omaisuudelle.<br/><br/>Nämä erot kahden kirjailijan tasa-arvon, vapauden ja oikeudenmukaisuuden tai epäoikeudenmukaisuuden kohtelussa huipentuvat heidän tulkintaansa luonnontilan ja sotatilan välisestä suhteesta. Hobbesin näkökulmasta nämä kaksi ovat synonyymejä, koska häikäilemätön kilpailu on ainoa looginen lopputulos, jossa ihmiset, joilla on vastaavat kyvyt ja samanlaiset tarpeet, asetetaan ympäristöön, jolla on rajalliset resurssit. Hän toteaa tämän yhteyden suoraan: "jos joku kaksi miestä haluaa samaa asiaa, josta he eivät kuitenkaan voi molemmat nauttia, heistä tulee vihollisia" ja he ovat siksi sotatilassa keskenään (Hobbes 75). Kuitenkin koska ihmisiä on lukuisia ja kaikilla on samanlaiset kyvyt ja tarpeet, tämä kilpailu ilmenee paitsi yksittäisissä vuorovaikutuksissa myös koko ihmiskunnan tasolla. Niin kauan kuin kaikilla ihmisillä on yhtäläiset ja rajattomat oikeudet kaikkiin resursseihin ja jopa toistensa kehoihin ja elämiin, luonnontila on "jokaisen ihmisen sota jokaista ihmistä vastaan" (Hobbes 76). Tämä synkkä tulkinta juontaa juurensa suoraan Hobbesin kuvaukseen luonnontilasta, jota hallitsevat yksinomaan yksilöiden itsekkäät viettit.<br/><br/>Locke puolestaan tekee eron luonnontilan ja sotatilan välillä ja huomauttaa, että vaikka ne voivat tapahtua samanaikaisesti, ei ole mitään syytä samaistua toisiinsa. Locken määritelmä sotatilasta on käytännössä sama kuin Hobbesin. Locken mukaan "se, joka yrittää saada toisen miehen absoluuttiseen valtaansa, asettuu siten sotatilaan hänen kanssaan" (14). Tämä selitys sopii täydellisesti yhteen hobbesilaisen käsityksen kanssa, jonka mukaan jokaisen yleinen oikeus kaikkeen, mukaan lukien muiden ihmisten ruumiit ja elämät, johtaa sotatilaan. Silti Locke kieltäytyy rinnastamasta sotatilaa ja luonnontilaa juuri siksi, että hän kieltää Hobbesin tulkinnan luonnollisesta vapaudesta. Koska Locken luonnontila estää ihmisiä vahingoittamasta toisiaan vapauden toisen rajoituksen kautta, toisen ihmisen vapauden yritys on rikkomus luonnonlakia vastaan. Vaikka Hobbesille sota on oletusarvoisesti ihmiskunnan tila, Locke esittää sen pikemminkin luonnontilan perversiona kuin sääntönään.<br/><br/>Nämä erot valtion rajaamisessa luontoon ja sen äänestäjiin, kuten vapauteen, tasa-arvoon, oikeudenmukaisuuteen ja sotaan, tasoittavat tietä tekijöille, jotka asettavat vastakkain kuvauksia hallinnosta. Luonnon tilaa koskevan pessimistisen arvionsa perusteella Leviathanin kirjoittaja päättelee, että sotaoloissa ei voi olla mitään varmaa toivoa "elää aikaa, jonka luonto tavallisesti antaa ihmisten elää" (Hobbes 80). Ratkaisu on universaalin oikeuden antaminen kaikkeen ja jokaisen jättäminen "niin paljon vapautta muita ihmisiä vastaan, kuin hän sallisi muiden ihmisten itseään vastaan" (Hobbes 80). Tuloksena olevan yhteiskuntasopimuksen osanottajat sijoittavat luovuttamansa rajattomat vapaudet yksinvaltiaaseen – ylimmän vallan haltijaan, jonka tarkoitus on säilyttää saavutettu status quo rankaisemalla kaikista sitä vastaan tehdyistä rikkomuksista. Hallitsijan valta on ehdoton: hallitsijalla on valta "tehdä mitä hän pitää tarpeellisena" edistääkseen rauhaa alamaistensa välillä, jotta kukaan ei hyökkäisi toisen henkeä tai omaisuutta vastaan (113). Hobbes päättelee, että ilman tällaista horjumatonta hahmoa, jolla on oikeus tehdä mitä tahansa alamaisille, ei voi olla rauhaa eikä turvallisuuden takeita.<br/><br/>Vaikka Locke on samaa mieltä tarpeesta luoda poliittisesti järjestäytyneitä yhteiskuntia, hän kuitenkin vastustaa Hobbesin käsitystä suvereenista vallasta rajoittamattomana ja luovuttamattomana. Kuten edellä mainittiin, Locken luonnontila ei ole läheskään niin kauhea kuin Hobbesin maalaama, koska ihmiset ovat velvollisia säilyttämään paitsi itsensä myös toisensa. Siksi yhteiskunnallisen sopimuksen tarve ei synny muiden pelosta, vaan pelkästä mukavuudesta. Pienet yhteisöt eivät välttämättä tarvitse lukuisia lakeja konfliktien ratkaisemiseksi ja "virkamiehiä prosessin hallitsemiseksi", mutta suuremmat yhdistykset pitävät suositeltavana hallitusten perustamista tähän tarkoitukseen (Locke 57). Kuitenkaan hallituksen valta ei voi olla rajaton, koska se johtaisi alamaisten alistamiseen "toisen ihmisen jatkuvalle, epävarmalle, tuntemattomalle, mielivaltaiselle tahdolle" (Locke 17). Tällainen hallitus merkitsisi luonnonlain kaksinaista rikkomista. Suostumalla toisen henkilön ehdottomaan valtaan elämässään, kohde rikkoisi sen ensimmäistä rajoitusta kieltäen vahingoittamasta itseään. Hallitsijan kannalta toisen henkilön vapauden tuhoaminen merkitsisi suoraa vahinkoa ja olisi sellaisenaan ristiriidassa toisen rajoituksen kanssa.<br/><br/>Hobbes kiistää vallanjaon periaatteena suorana jatkona väitteelleen rajattomasta valtiollisesta vallasta. Hänen näkökulmastaan suvereenilla on kerran asetettuna "koko valta määrätä säännöt", jotka säätelevät subjektien elämää tai lyhyemmin sanottuna lainsäädäntövaltaa (Hobbes 114). Suvereeni varaa itselleen myös oikeuden "kuulla ja päättää kaikista kiistoista" – toisin sanoen tuomiovallan (Hobbes 114). Lopuksi, koska hallitsijan koko tarkoitus on pakottaa alamaiset pidättäytymään toistensa vahingoittamisesta, ei voi olla epäilystäkään siitä, että toimeenpanovalta on myös hänen yksinomainen valtaoikeutensa. Vallan erottaminen käsitteenä on Hobbesille vierasta hänen luonnontilaa koskevien näkemystensä vuoksi. Poliittisen kokonaisuuden luominen, jossa toimeenpanevat, lainsäädännölliset ja oikeudelliset haarat tarkistaisivat toisensa – eli kilpailisivat – merkitsisi hobbesilaisen luonnontilan uudelleenluomista sodan kaltaiseksi korkeammalla tasolla. Koska ihmiset solmivat yhteiskuntasopimuksen ja perustavat hallituksen, joka laittaa luonnontilan heidän taakseen, eikä palauta sitä eri muodossa, vallanjako on ristiriidassa Hobbesin näkemysten kanssa suoraan.<br/><br/>Locke sen sijaan omaksuu vallanjaon poliittisen teoriansa perusperiaatteena. Hänen erottamisen syynsä käy ilmi keskustelusta lainsäädäntövallan rajoista. Locken mukaan olisi tuskin suositeltavaa, että "samoilla henkilöillä, joilla on valta säätää lakeja, olisi myös valta panna ne täytäntöön" (76). Filosofi viittaa ihmisluonnon epätäydellisyyteen ja luontaiseen haluun "tarttua valtaan" tämän varotoimenpiteen perusteluna (Locke 76). Aivan kuten Hobbesin tapauksessa, Locken kertomus vallanjaosta juontuu suoraan hänen tulkinnastaan luonnon tilasta. Jos luonnontilassa on jo oikeudenmukaisuutta ja kansa voi sen ymmärtää, jokainen hallitus on väistämättä saman luonnonlain alainen. Koska absoluuttinen valta ihmisiin rikkoo tämän lain molempia rajoituksia, sen erottaminen ja jakaminen on suositeltavaa, jotta hallitus toimisi asianmukaisesti.<br/><br/>Tämä paperi on osoittanut, että vaikka erot Hobbesin ja Locken tilien välillä ihmiskunnan luonnollisesta tilasta ovat lukuisat, ne lopulta merkitsevät sitä, että moraalisia lähtökohtia ei ole. Hobbes pitää luonnontilaa rajattoman vapauden tilana, jossa ihmiset, joille on annettu yhtäläiset kyvyt ja joita eivät sido mitkään moraaliset käsitykset, kuten oikeudenmukaisuus, kilpailevat resursseista lakkaamatta. Locke kuitenkin tulkitsee tasa-arvoa ja vapautta eettisesti eikä käytännössä ja ajattelee, että sota on luonnontilan perversio, sillä luonnonlaki velvoittaa ihmisiä olemaan vahingoittamatta toisiaan. Tämä erimielisyys vaikuttaa filosofien lähestymistapoihin hallitukseen. Hobbes vaatii kaikkivoipaa hallitsijaa, sillä eettisten rajoitusten puuttuessa mikään muu auktoriteetti ei voisi pakottaa ihmisiä olemaan vahingoittamatta toisiaan. Silti Locken mielestä rajoittamattomien valtuuksien myöntäminen hallitukselle olisi ristiriidassa luonnonlakiin sisältyvien eettisten rajoitusten kanssa, minkä vuoksi hän, toisin kuin Hobbes, kannattaa vallanjakoa. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Muotipoliisi: Mitä Game of Thrones oksensi<br/><br/>Kanadalais-ranskalainen laulaja Abbas Hasan laittoi sokaisevan yrityksen syrjäyttää koko ihmiskunta Fashion Parade 2014 -tapahtumassa. Siinä ei ole mitään vikaa, paitsi turvallisuus on etusijalla ja muusikko on tässä terveysriski.<br/><br/>Hän ei valitettavasti saanut muistiota, jossa kerrotaan epätoivoisille ja pahamaineisille, että tähteys on metafora. Ei tarvitse näyttää tähdeltä ja kirjaimellisesti sytyttää näköä tuleen. Myös All Pakistan Aunty Association on virallisesti tehnyt hänestä valituksen. Paikalliset markkinat ovat kuivuneet väärennetyistä kristalleista ja paljetein koristelluista hirveyksistä. Heillä ei ole mitään päällepantavaa joka toinen viikko nautittaviin teehensä ja he väittävät hänen olevan syyllinen. Ilmeisesti asu on saanut innoituksensa Game of Thronesista. Voisiko hän pysyä säveltämässä surullisia lauluja naapurinsa kuolleesta koirasta sen sijaan, että konseptoisi asuja? Tai ehkä se on koiran menettämisen trauma, jonka kuolema ei selvästikään ole ohi, koska hän käyttää edelleen sen raatoa.<br/><br/>Latausarkki Outfit<br/><br/>Kukaan ei osaa päättää, mistä asu alkaa ja mihin Abbas loppuu. Tuijotat lumoissasi, vajoat syvään syvyyteen ja ihmettelet, miksi hänellä on nahkahousut. Kenen hevosen hän tappoi varastaakseen olkapäilleen verhotun satulan? Oliko hän vankilassa juuri ennen punaisen maton ilmestymistään ja unohti ottaa kahleet pois? Miten hän selviää synteettisestä nahasta ja sequinin jälkeisestä ihottumasta, joka on varmasti tappava niin suurina annoksina? Miksi olen vielä elossa?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>Hänen inspiraationsa oli näennäisesti Game of Thrones, mutta hän päätyi lopulta näyttämään siltä, että hänet heitettiin viikinkiravintolasta. Jos hän olisi törmännyt johonkin sarjan hahmoista, hän olisi tapettu ensimmäisen jakson viidessä ensimmäisessä sekunnissa.<br/><br/>Mielenterveys tai sen puute: Joku saa hänet neuvonantajaan ASAP! Hän näyttää olettavan, että kuolleen koiran käyttäminen tarkoittaa, että ainoa ystävä, joka hänellä oli elämässään, on edelleen elossa. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Kieltäminen ei ole joki Egyptissä<br/><br/>2. Kidutettu psyykesi ei auta musiikkiasi, joten hanki apua<br/><br/>3. Kokeile kuvitteellisia ystäviä<br/><br/>Hypätkää!<br/><br/>Me kaikki muotipoliisin päämajassa olemme pahasti traumatisoituneita. Abbas on henkilö, josta emme nauttineet pidätyksestä. Hän on tällä hetkellä pidätettynä ja yrittää kostaa pukemalla ylleen muiden fantasiasarjojen asuja. Hän vain liimasi itsensä yhteen näyttääkseen Edward Cullenilta Twilightista. Julkisen palvelun viestinä ja uusien hermoromahdusten estämiseksi annoimme hänelle seuraavat esimerkit saman tapahtuman punaisesta matosta.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>Jos olet epävarma, pelaa varman päälle. Laulaja näyttää tavalliselta sedältä shaadilla. Tavallinen musta puku, jossa ei ole lisävarusteita, vaikka se olisikin hieman suhteeton, on käyttökelpoinen. Zohaibin ilme sulautuu kaikkeen ja ei mihinkään, ja kun ei ole muotitajua tai rahaa palkata stylistiä, tämä ei haittaa. Se ei kanna sydänpysähdyksen riskiä tapahtuman osallistujille. Ottaen huomioon Abbasin herkän mielentilan, hänen tulisi pyrkiä tähän katseeseen aina ja ikuisesti.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>Eräänä päivänä, vuosikymmenten terapian jälkeen, Abbas voisi pyrkiä pukeutumaan kuten Ali Zafar. Ali oli todella lähellä näyttää ranskalaisen ravintolan hovimestarilta, jolla oli valkoinen kesätakki mustilla kauluksilla, mutta paita pelastaa sen, satiinista välittämättä. Hänen housunsa olisivat olleet naurettavat, jos niitä ei olisi taitettu nilkkoihin. Kengät ovat mitä hipster chic onnellinen loppuja on tehty. |
| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil.... [Show full abstract] | Maaperän hydraulisten ominaisuuksien määrittäminen eri kostutusnesteillä : Lincolnin yliopiston maisterin tutkintoa koskevien vaatimusten osittainen täyttäminen<br/><br/>Tiivistelmä<br/><br/>Maaperän hydrauliset ominaisuudet, kuten hydraulinen johtavuus, vedenpidätyskyky ja kasvien vesisuhteet hallitsevat veden liikeprosesseja, esimerkiksi tunkeutuminen, haihtuminen ja veden virtaus maaperän sisällä. Laajalle levinneenä ilmiönä maaperässä maaperän vedenhylkivyys muuttaa maaperän hydraulisia toimintoja vastustamalla veden virtausta maaperään. Lisäksi hydrauliset ominaisuudet eivät riipu vain maaperän huokosjärjestelmästä, vaan myös huokospintojen fysikaalis-kemialliset ominaisuudet vaikuttavat. Veteen verrattuna veden hylkivyys ei vaikuta etanoliin sen matalamman pintajännityksen vuoksi. Etanolin käytön tarkoituksena on poistaa maaperän vedenhylkivyyden vaikutus hydraulisten ominaisuuksien mittauksiin. Puhtaan etanolin levittäminen luonnolliseen maaperään voi kuitenkin hajottaa maaperän orgaanisia materiaaleja ja johtaa muutoksiin fysikaalisissa ominaisuuksissa. Siksi vesipitoiset etanoliliuokset voivat olla vaihtoehtoinen vaihtoehto. Siitä huolimatta ei tiedetä, onko mahdollista käyttää vesipitoista etanolia maaperän nesteretentiokäyrän määrittämiseen. Tässä tutkimuksessa pyritään testaamaan vesipitoisten etanoliliuosten (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % ja 100 % v/v) käyttökelpoisuutta nesteretentiokäyrän muodostamisessa pienellä painealueella karkeahiekkanäytteissä, joissa on erilainen kostuvuus ja orgaaninen muutettu luonnonmaa (Templeton silt loam (TSL) sienikompostin, biohiilen, meijerin sivuvirran ja kunnalliskompostin kanssa, käyttöaste oli 15 painoprosenttia). Tulos osoitti, että vesipitoisten etanoliliuosten desorptio veteen verrattuna oli noin 1-3 kertaa nopeampaa perustuen nestepitoisuuteen samalla levitetyllä paineella ja kunkin tasapainon saavuttamiseen kuluvaan aikaan. Hiekkakokeen tulokset viittasivat siihen, että kun vesipitoisen etanoliliuoksen pitoisuus oli alle 50 %, haihtumisen aiheuttamat häviöt olivat alle 1 % ja suhteelliset erot testinesteen ja veden välillä olivat alle 10 %. Haihdutushäviöt olivat kuitenkin 11,06 % ja 24,6 %, ja suhteelliset erot olivat kaikki noin 15 % ja 30 % 50 % ja 100 % etanoliliuoksessa. Sen sijaan Templeton silt savessa tehdyt orgaaniset muutokset paitsi lisäsivät vedenpidätyskykyä, myös vähensivät haihtumishäviöitä. Haihdutushäviöt TSL-maaperässä ja TSL-maaperässä orgaanisin muutoksin olivat 1 % liuoksissa, joissa oli alle 50 % etanolia. Haihdutushäviöt 50 % ja 100 % etanolia olivat vastaavasti 2,8 % ja 2,9 %. Veden ja testinesteen suhteelliset erot olivat samanlaisia kuin hiekkakokeessa, kun testinesteen pitoisuudet olivat alle 50 %. Suhteelliset erot 50 % ja 100 % etanoliliuoksessa olivat kuitenkin pienemmät kuin hiekkanäytteessä, noin 10 % ja 15 %. Lisäksi suhteellisen eron analysointi viittasi siihen, että lähes kaikilla vesipitoisilla etanoliliuoksilla oli pienempi tilavuusnestepitoisuus samalla syöttöpaineella verrattuna veteen, mikä oli heijastusta vesipitoisista etanoliliuoksista, jotka desorboituivat nopeammin kuin vesi vastaavassa paineessa. Sen vuoksi 10-40 prosenttia etanoliliuoksista voitaisiin pitää vaihtoehtona maaperän hydraulisten ominaisuuksien määrittämiselle, koska niiden desorptionopeus on nopeampi eikä maaperän vedenhylkivyys vaikuta niihin. Orgaanisen aineksen haihtumisen ja liukenemisen vuoksi yli 50 % vesipitoiset etanoliliuokset eivät soveltuneet karkealle hiekalle tai keskikokoiselle teksturoidulle maaperälle....

Oregon's Rogue River Valley, California's High Foothills Growing season: May to early Oct. Summers are hot and dry; typical winter lows run from 23 degrees to 9 degrees F/-5 degrees to -13 degrees C. The summer-winter contrast suits plants that need dry, hot summers and moist, only moderately cold winters. In the U.S. we ripen them by putting them in a sunny east or west window. Tomatoes can be found in nearly every vegetable garden across the country, and with good reason, as little else compares to the flavor of a home-grown tomato. Remove tomato plant from the nursery pot (even if it is a peat pot). Until fairly recently, this favorite fruit was either imported from growers in Mexico or produced as greenhouse tomatoes in California or Arizona. Beans (Zones 3-10): There are two main kinds of beans found in gardens, bush beans and pole beans. The same tips and methods can be applied to late tomato planting in many hot-summer areas.

When to Plant Tomatoes in Sacramento Valley. Most tomatoes, peppers and eggplants, for example, require around 100 days to harvest, therefore you'd want to transplant those into the ground around August 1. Transplants can be set into the ground beginning in about April, but tomatoes are warm weather plants, so planting when the weather is warmer is usually better. Suggested varieties: California Wonder, ... It's still not too late to plant tomatoes and peppers from seeds as well. The mycorrhizal fungi assist with water and nutrient absorption by the plant and reduce plant stress. Northern California and the north coast: Growing tomatoes in a greenhouse isn't for the faint of heart; they require specific greenhouse tomato plant care entirely different from other crops. ZONE 8.
