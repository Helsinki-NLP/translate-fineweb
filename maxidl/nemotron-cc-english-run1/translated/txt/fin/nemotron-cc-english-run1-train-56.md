| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Samalla kun tunnustetaan, että on mahdotonta väittää jonkun rakastavan jotain, jota he vihaavat, ja päinvastoin, on silti usein nautinnollista yrittää väitellä. Kun puhumme ihmisille, joiden mielipiteet ovat suoraan ristiriidassa omamme kanssa, meidän on pakko puolustaa makuamme, määritellä mielipiteemme ja analysoida, miksi reagoimme niin kuin toimimme. Siksi meillä on Why Don't You Like This?, jossa kaksi työntekijäämme yrittävät selvittää, voivatko ihmiset, joilla on vastakkaiset mielipiteet, päästä yli "Ei, olet väärässä!" ja käydä kansalaisläheistä, rakentavaa ja mahdollisesti jopa vakuuttavaa keskustelua kiistakysymyksistään. Sillä riippumatta siitä, mitä puheradio sanoo, on vielä keskitie "Olemme täysin samaa mieltä" ja "Olen oikeassa, ja sinä olet tyhmä ja paha."<br/><br/>Scott: Siitä lähtien kun keskustelimme Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World -luopumuksestani, olemme etsineet tapausta, jossa voin kutsua sinut ulos, koska et pidä jostain ihanasta, eikä meidän tarvinnut etsiä pitkään. Istuimme aivan vierekkäin Martin Scorsesen Hugo-elokuvan aikana, täysin lumoutuneina sen fantastisesta kunnianosoituksesta varhaisen mykkäelokuvan ihmeille, ja sinä ilmeisesti vastustaen sitä joka käänteessä. Kriittinen konsensus on ollut puolellani: se osui kollektiivimme Top 15 -listan sijalle 9 (vaikka listasit sen yliarvostetuksi valinnaksesi), on voittanut (tai sijoittunut) eri elokuvakritiikin palkintoihin, ja nauttii tällä hetkellä 83 pistettä Metacriticissä. Se ei tietenkään tarkoita, että olisit väärässä, mutta velvollisuus on selittää, miksi Hugo oli sanoissasi "ontto ja keinotekoinen", jossa monet meistä näkivät sen ihastuttavana Scorsese-lapsuuden ja meedio, kun se oli vielä lapsenkengissään. Ja ole hellä kun revit tämän perhosen kappaleiksi siivistä.<br/><br/>Mainos<br/><br/>Tasha: En voi olla hellä, Scott. Joskus sattuu vähemmän, jos revitään laastari kerralla pois. (Ja vaikka ei olisikaan, kuka haluaa kävellä ympäriinsä puoliksi repäisty laastari? Gross.) Tosiasia on, että Hugo oli väsyttävän manipuloiva harjoitus väärennöksissä, alkaen sen avaamisesta liukui Pariisin rautatieaseman läpi, mikä muistutti minua enemmän kuin mikään muu Robert Zemeckisin Polar Expressistä. Toisin kuin Mike D'Angelo, olen fani pitkä, katkeamaton vie keinona luoda tilaa ja kannustaa katsojia tiedostamatta pidättämään hengitystään kameran tutkiessa aluetta; mutta kun tutkittava tila on liukas, kiiltävä CGI-luomus, ja kamera kelluu painottomasti sen läpi ilman fyysistä aistia, että joko kamera tai ympäristö ovat todella olemassa, että etsintä alkaa tuntua katsomassa jonkun muun pelaavan videopeliä. Ja loppuosa elokuvasta tuntui yhtä huokoiselta ja epätodelliselta sekä lavastuksensa että erittäin mutkikkaan, maudlin-tarinansa puolesta.<br/><br/>Minulla ei välttämättä ole ongelmia valmistettujen, tyyliteltyjen ympäristöjen kanssa elokuvissa. Rakastin Baz Luhrmannin yhtä rönsyilevää, täysin keinotekoista otetta Pariisista esimerkiksi Moulin Rougessa, mutta siinä elokuvassa on oma naurettavuuden tunne, huumorintaju siitä, kuinka tarkoituksella ylimalkainen se on. Jean-Pierre Jeunet'n tyylittelyyn varsinkin Améliessa. (Molemmat Jeunet ja Luhrmann tuntuivat voimakkailta visuaalisilta vaikutuksilta täällä.) Sain kuitenkin sen käsityksen, että Martin Scorsese halusi minun ottavan Hugon täysin vakavasti. Vaikka se on jälleen yksi kipeyttävä sentimentaalinen tarina sisukkaasta orvosta, joka tuo värin takaisin äreän vanhan äkäpussin elämään.<br/><br/>Mainos<br/><br/>Elokuvassa ei ole mitään, mistä nautin enemmän kuin yllättymisestä, - eikä ole mitään, mitä paheksuisin ja vastustaisin enemmän kuin avointa manipulointia, äänekkäästi kertomista, mitä tuntea ja milloin tuntea. Hyvä elokuva tekee tällaista hienovaraisesti; paha käyttää kaatuvia musiikkivihjeitä ja makeita merkkijonoja – ja tässä tapauksessa rähjäistä, valtavasilmäistä, epäsiistiä orpoa, joka tuijottaa surullisesti kameraa – vaatiakseen paatosta ja kertoakseen katsojille, että he ovat kamalia ihmisiä, jos he eivät tarjoile sitä pyydettäessä. Siitä huolimatta voin käsitellä surullisia lapsia ja äreitä aikuisia, jotka tekevät elämästä parempaa toisilleen - minä todella kaivoin tämän vuoden Le Havren, joka oli pohjimmiltaan sama juoni ilman kaikkea söpöyttä - mutta mielestäni keinotekoiset ympäristöt heijastavat huonosti keinotekoisia tunteita, ja kumpikin saa toisen näyttämään väärennöksellisemmältä vuorotellen.<br/><br/>Unohdettujen elokuvien videolla sinä ja Noel veitte Keithin tehtävään puolustaa Tyrannosaurusta, koska se ei ollut mielestänne tarpeeksi realistinen – liian juonikas, liian miserablistinen, liian paljon, liian pitkälle. Miten on mahdollista, että et voi ostaa vanhan kammen, joka rikkoo asioita, kun hän on vihainen, mutta voit ostaa orvon, joka asuu jättimäisen juna-aseman kellon sisällä ja lähtee oikulliselle matkalle korjaamaan salaperäistä automaattia, jonka hän uskoo voivan kantaa salaisuuksia kuolleelta isältään, mutta joka sen sijaan johtaa hänet omituiselle itsensä löytämisen matkalle, elokuvan maagiseen maahan? Etkö koskaan löytänyt Hugon prameaa rokokoo-designia, aggressiivista sydämenjännitystä tai kottikärrykuormaa oikkuja edes hieman liioiteltuna tai vaikeasti nieltävänä?<br/><br/>Mainos<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet ja Luhrmann vaikutteina Scorsese?! Unohda olla tahditon, nyt tarkoituksella tökkäät minua terävällä kepillä. Jos etsit inspiraatiota Hugolle – itse asiassa, jos etsit Hugon emotionaalista ydintä – sinun on palattava Scorsesen lapsuuteen Elizabeth Streetillä Little Italyssa, jossa astmaa sairastava pikkupoika, joka ei pysty leikkimään ulkona muiden lasten kanssa, vetäytyi Alexander Korda -fantasioihin kuten The Thief Of Bagdad. Tai yksinkertaisemmin, mene suoraan itse lähteeseen: George Méliés, jonka A Trip To The Moon pysyy kaikkien elokuvallisten fantasioiden alkuräjähdyksenä, sillä hetkellä kun kameraa ei käytetty dokumentoimaan maailmaa sellaisena kuin se on, mutta mitä tahansa oikullista, taianomaista, kuljetettavaa paikkaa elokuvantekijä haluaa keksiä sitä varten. Ja sitä perinnettä on kehitetty ja laajennettu vuosikymmeniä ennen kuin Jeunet'n ja Luhrmannin kaltaiset saivat riehakkaat pikku käpälänsä sen päälle.<br/><br/>Jeunetista puheen ollen, hyvä yritys viedä retorinen aseeni, mutta sanon sen kuitenkin: kuinka voit rakastaa Amélieta, mutta silti pitää Hugoa synteettisenä ja "liiallisena" ja "väsyttävän manipuloivana"? Sanot, että Amélie ja Moulin Rouge ovat lunastaneet "järjen omasta naurettavuudestaan", jossa Scorsese tarkoittaa, että otamme Hugon vakavasti, enkä usko, että näin on, ainakaan jälkimmäisessä kohdassa. Scorsese tuntee ilmeistä intohimoa elokuviin, oletan, että tulkitset Hugon itsevakavaksi, mutta minulle nuo tunteet antavat elokuvalle emotionaalisen painolastin, jota Luhrmannin ja Jeunetin elokuvissa ei ole. Kaikissa kolmessa elokuvassa käytetään aggressiivisesti hyväksi CGI:n ihmeitä – ja Scorsese lisää 3D:n miksaukseen, upeaan vaikutukseen – mutta siinä, missä sinä ja minä olemme eri mieltä, on kysymys painottomuudesta. Olen samaa mieltä siitä, että CGI:llä on etäännyttävä vaikutus; pelkästään digitaalisesta muovailuvahasta koostuvat maailmat ovat joustavia siinä määrin, että niillä ei joskus ole lainkaan läsnäoloa. Viittasit Hugoon "Overrated"-kohtauksessasi "Best Of Film" -kappaleessa "CGI-gimcrack" - täydellinen dis... toiseen elokuvaan.<br/><br/>Mainos<br/><br/>On reilua sanoa, että Scorsese on rakentanut Hugon vakio-aiheisen, "sydänjännittävän" lastenkirjan/elokuvan juonen ympärille: Orpo ikävöi isäänsä, luo oman pienen fantasiamaailmansa, glomit uuden ystävän päälle, vakuuttaa karskia vanhaa fuddy-duddya pehmenemään ja ehkä adoptoi hänet. Mutta se on vain kerronnan luuranko, ja Scorsese tarjoaa runsaasti lihaa ja verta. Ensinnäkin, et voi katsella Hugoa, yksinäistä poikaa, joka kurkistaa kellotorneista Pariisin rautatieaseman hälinään ajattelematta Scorsesea, toista yksinäistä poikaa, joka tuijottaa ulos makuuhuoneensa ikkunasta Elizabeth Streetillä. Ja vaikka et olisikaan tarpeeksi iso filminörtti tuon yhteyden muodostamiseen, tuntuu todella siltä, että Hugon matka ei ole uuden isähahmon löytämisessä, vaan oman isänsä perintönä olevan mekaanisen taikuuden hellittämättömyydessä. Sitä elokuva on: Vision pysyvyys, jonka avulla voimme hyväksyä kuvitteellisen version maailmasta 24 kuvaa sekunnissa, on tiedettä ja taikuutta kerralla. Hugon suhteessa Méliésiin ei ole kyse siitä, että hän viihtyisi uuden isän seurassa, vaan siitä, että hän jakaa yhteisen innostuksen, jonka vanha mies on upottanut katkeruuteen.<br/><br/>Etkö todellakaan löytänyt ketään Hugoa lumoavaa? Jopa elokuvan harvat arvostelijat näyttävät olevan halukkaita myöntämään, että elokuvahistoriaa ja Méliésin studiota herättävät kohtaukset – Michael Stuhlbargin ollessa sankarillinen elokuvatutkija! – olivat mahtavia. Se tuntui, parhaalla mahdollisella tavalla, kuin huumaava kompressio History Of Film 101 -luokastani collegessa, tiivistäen lukukauden verran leikkeitä ja kontekstia joksikin montaasin ja animoidun ponnahduskirjan väliin. Ja se puhuu elokuvan nerokkaasta suunnittelusta, joka kerrostaa faktaa ja fantasiaa niin kauniisti, että se on samalla Mélisin ja elokuvan synnyn historiaa, ja juuri sellaista yksinkertaista, loisteliaasti tuotettua elokuvallista ihmettä, jota Scorsese itse olisi rakastanut lapsena. Luojan kiitos Hugo ei seuraa Jeunet/Luhrmann-mallia ja hänellä on "tunne omasta naurettavuudestaan". Fantasiatuntijana itse sanoisit, että sen soittaminen suorana ja vakavana ja häpeilemättömänä on arvokasta sen sijaan, että iskisit silmää yleisölle? Hugo saattaa olla sairaan suloinen, mutta en usko, että sen tunteen autenttisuus on kiellettävä.<br/><br/>Mainos<br/><br/>Tasha: Kyllä, itse asiassa löysin osia Hugosta lumoavan. (Huomaa, kuinka vastaan kysymykseesi etukäteen, kun taas olit liian kiireinen vaahtoamaan apopleksian kanssa käsittelemään omaani, vaikka oletan, että se on vastaus itsessään. Okei, "vaikuttaminen" saattaa liioitella tapausta – tarkoitin vain, että visuaalinen tyyli näytti hyvin tutulta. Vaikka kuten Keith huomautti, kun otit tämän esille henkilökohtaisesti, Scorsese ei vastusta inspiraation hakemista muiden ihmisten visuaalisista kuvista, eikä ole immuuni sille.) Ensisijaisesti lumouduin Georges Mélisin taustatarinaa käsittelevistä osista, hänen rakkaudestaan elokuvaan, hänen taiteeseensa panemistaan töistä ja siitä saamastaan ilosta. Vedenalaisen kentän kohtauksen lavastuksessa on hirveän paljon kauneutta ja hauskuutta Méliésin "Fairylandista", ja lopussa jaksossa keskitytään Méliésin kuvamateriaaliin. Myönnän, että Hugon yhteys Méliésiin yhteisen elokuvanrakkauden vuoksi on mukava kosketus, ja nautin kyllä hyvästä elokuvasta.<br/><br/>Hugossa ei kuitenkaan ole kyse ensisijaisesti elokuvasta, vaan siteeraamiesi teemojen lisäksi myös oman tarkoituksen löytämisestä, kuten hahmot nimenomaisesti ja vaivalloisesti selittävät toisilleen ja meille. Ja se kertoo spektaakkelista, isoista toimintalavasteista ja takaa-ajoista, ja onnellisesti-ikuisista lopuista, joissa jopa vihainen kiusaaja ja ujo vanhempi pari ja fergawdsakes jopa äkäinen mäyräkoira kaikki saavat parikseen hurmaavia rakkausintressejä loppuun mennessä. Se kertoo superesikoisesta Hermione Grangerista, joka on määräilevä, terhakka ja nokkela ja ylistää kirjoihin koteloituja maagisia maailmoja.<br/><br/>Mainos<br/><br/>Scorsese leikkii arkkityypeillä, mutta en ole koskaan kokenut hänen hukuttaneen niihin mitään uutta, tuoretta tai uskottavaa, huolimatta omasta taustatarinastaan. Olisin paljon mieluummin kertonut tarinan nuoresta scorselaisesta, joka varttui astman kanssa – jotain pienimuotoista ja todellista, ilman valtavia huoneita, jotka olivat täynnä CGI:n kellokoneistoa ja kultaisia hehkuvia tomupaloja ja profeetallisia unia sekä raivoavaa aikuista tyranninvartijaa, jolla oli sydän täynnä kultaa – kaikkea sitä ylimitoitettua, ylenpalttista hölynpölyä. Scorsesen henkilökohtainen tausta ja rakkaus elokuvaan ovat todisteita siitä, että hän todella tuntee, mitä hän laittaa valkokankaalle, mutta en tunne hänen henkilökohtaista kosketustaan mihinkään tässä lukuun ottamatta hetkiä, jotka koskevat nimenomaan elokuvaa. Ydintunteet voivat olla todellisia, mutta se ei tee teloituksesta vähemmän valheellista.<br/><br/>Sanot, ettei tunteen aitoutta voi kiistää. En epäile, tunsiko Scorsese itsensä lapsena henkilökohtaisesti yksinäiseksi ja eristyneeksi, mutta en tunne yksinäisyyttä ja eristyneisyyttä valkokankaalla – näen joukon liioiteltuja merkityksiä (Hugo on saastainen ja hänen vaatteensa ovat kuluneet ja kaikki aikuiset huutavat hänelle ja hän joutuu säännöllisesti pelottavan koiran jahtaamaksi!) ja isoja lyöntiä, huutaen ja itkien ja Spielbergiläisen ihmeentunnosta. Vilpittömyys on minulle vakuuttavampaa ja henkilökohtaisempaa, kun se on hiljaista ja suoraviivaista; kun joku huutaa mielipiteitään minulle, oletan, että hän on joko todella vihainen tai yrittää vain hukuttaa aistini estääkseen minua ilmaisemasta omaa mielipidettäni. Hugo oli yksi pitkä huuto, mitä minuun tulee.<br/><br/>Mainos<br/><br/>Miksi en saanut sitä valehtelun tunnetta Amélielta, itse asiassa sain. Tunnustan täysin, että Amélie ja Moulin Rouge ovat molemmat suuria, manipuloivia, keinotekoisia konstruktioita, jotka vaativat erityisiä tunteita tietyin väliajoin, ja yrittävät myydä näitä tunteita raskaalla tunteella ja aggressiivisella soundtrackilla prodding. Kumpikaan ei oikein myynyt tunteitaan aitona ihmistunteena. Nautin noissa kahdessa elokuvassa konstruktiosta – erityisesti Amélien huumaavista, naurettavista listoista sattumanvaraisia piirteitä ja kokemuksia sen näyttelijäkaartille, sekä Moulin Rougen musikaalimashupeista ja uudelleenkontekstualisoinnista. Minua myydään usein tarinoilla, jotka tekevät luovia tai kunnianhimoisia asioita rakenteella, ja molemmat niistä elokuvista kelpuutetaan, jossa Hugo on paljon lineaarisempi, tavallinen lapsikysely.<br/><br/>Mutta loppujen lopuksi kyse on minusta todella tunteesta, että nuo elokuvat ovat hölynpölyä, kun taas Hugo on tarkoitettu otettavaksi vakavasti jokaisena treacly-hetkenä. Et usko, että se on totta - mutta puolustat samanaikaisesti sen eheyttä sen ehdottoman autenttisen, juurtuneen Scorsesen historian tunteen suhteen ja kerroit, että olen väärässä, eikä hän tarkoita sitä, että se otettaisiin vakavasti. Mitä elokuvasta voi päätellä, ettei sitä ole tarkoitettu ymmärrettäväksi? Ja onko mahdollista, että tämä on vain toinen utelias tapaus Benjamin Buttonin kaltaisessa tilanteessa, jossa lasten käyttö suuren budjetin elokuvissa on suurelta osin sappy ja melodramaattinen, kun taas sinä isänä huomaat sen ohittavan kyynisyytesi ja menevän suoraan perhetunteeseesi?<br/><br/>Mainos<br/><br/>Scott: En ole varma tarkoitinko, että Scorsese ei tarkoita tulla otetuksi vakavasti; se on vain, että hän on valinnut oikullisen ajoneuvon, jonka kautta ilmaista vakavaa rakkautta elokuviin. Kun sanotaan, että "Hugossa ei ole kyse ensisijaisesti elokuvasta, Méliés'n sidonnaisuuksista huolimatta", olen ymmälläni. Myönnän, että pidät monia Hugon elementtejä liian tuttuina ja työläinä ja täynnä Spielbergiläisiä ihmeentunteita – en voi tehdä mitään väitelläkseni tuon havainnon ympärillä, jonka muut Hugo-epäilijät jakavat. Joskus elokuva merkitsee hurmaamista ja lumoamista, ja joillekin se ei sitä tee; sinulla on Hugo ja minulla Amélie, vaikka minusta jälkimmäinen, tarkoituksellisesti keinotekoinen, merkitsee sitä, että pidämme sitä romanttisena. (Sen sijaan, että joku kauhea mekaaninen vehje sopisi Saw-jatko-osaan.)<br/><br/>Mutta sanoa, että Hugo ei ole ensisijaisesti elokuva? Jos se ei ole elokuva, niin se on kaikkein turhaa diskursiivinen tarina [mitä luulet, että se on noin] olen koskaan nähnyt. Hugon ja Méliésin suhde on elokuvan ydin, ja sen ytimessä ei ole vain jokin varastoyhteys Plucky Orphanin ja Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Goldin välillä, vaan yhteinen affiniteetti suunniteltuun taikaan – erityisesti elokuvien taikaan. Scorsese ja hänen yhteistyökumppaninsa ovat löytäneet tavan ilmaista innostustaan elokuvan alkuaikoina fantasian kautta, joka on kaikkien aikakausien ulottuvilla. Arkkityypin täyttämä lasten tarina on vain kuori täällä; elokuva on piirakka. (Mmmm... piirakka.)<br/><br/>Mainos<br/><br/>Mitä tulee The Curious Case Of Benjamin Buttoniin, en näe juurikaan yhteyttä, muuta kuin yrittää paljastaa minut Benjamin Buttonin puolustajana keinona vahingoittaa uskottavuuttani. (Muuten, miten ylimääräiset ovat siinä G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-rayssa?) Olen sanonut, että univajeinen uusi isä minussa oli ehkä haavoittuvainen Benjamin Buttonille, mutta en voi kuvitella aikaa, jolloin vanheneminen käänteisesti ei liikuttaisi minua. Miten se ei voi vaikuttaa sinuun?) Enkä sitä paitsi näe, miten Benjamin Button liittyy paljon Hugoon lapsia koskevana elokuvana, koska se on vain pieni segmentti tarinasta, joka ulottuu paljon laajemmalle kehityskaarelle.<br/><br/>Olenko vakuuttanut sinut? Todennäköisesti en. Mutta olen iloinen kuullessani, että Hugo ei ollut täysin vailla lumouksia sinulle. Mélis-elokuvantekijän jaksot ovat se, mikä laittoi Hugon minulle - ja siinä ainakin voimme jakaa jonkin verran elokuvarakkautta.<br/><br/>Mainos<br/><br/>Tasha: Ei, en voi sanoa, että olet vakuuttanut minut, sen enempää kuin minäkään olen vakuuttanut sinut. On mahdotonta väittää ketään minkään sisäisestä rakkaudesta, ja todella pitäisi olla yhtä mahdotonta puhua joku alas sisäisestä rakkaudesta. Enimmäkseen olet antanut minun nähdä Hugon Scott-O-Visionissa, mikä on mielenkiintoinen kokemus; ainakin nyt olen lievästi vakuuttunut siitä, että emme jotenkin onnistuneet näkemään täysin erilaisia elokuvia, joilla molemmilla oli jotenkin sama nimi ja ohjaaja.<br/><br/>Meillä oli kuitenkin varmasti erilaisia kokemuksia, ja mielestäni keskityimme tuotannon eri puoliin: en edelleenkään näe "elokuva on ihmeellinen" -teemaa elokuvan yhtenä strandina, jopa yhtenä liian monen joukossa. "Täysin diskursiivinen" melkein peittää sen, vaikka heittäisin "usein tarpeettoman söpöä ja arvokasta" sen päälle. Kun keskityt elokuvan maukkaaseen piirakantäyttöön, tuntuu siltä, että piirakka peitettiin paunalla kiteytettyä sokeria, ja uskon, että sillä on merkitystä, riippumatta elokuvan ydinviestistä tai kourallisesta upeita kohtauksia. Katso myös Benjamin Button, jota en tuonut esille vain kiusatakseni sinua – uskon todella, että sinulla on enemmän tunteellinen juova kuin minulla elokuvien lasten suhteen, varsinkin kun niitä käytetään enemmän haavoittuvuuden ja viattomuuden symboleina kuin ihmishahmoina. Hei, tiedättekö, mikä elokuva ei todellakaan ole söpöjä laajasilmäisiä moppetteja, jotka tuovat toivoa kyyniseen maailmaan? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Ehkä menen katsomaan niitä Blu-ray-lisäosia. Voisin käyttää räjähdys-insuliinia kompensoimaan Hugon suloisuutta. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | "Toivoin, että tyttäreni olisi vapaa vaikeista ja huolestuttavista ajoista": Mee Meen tarina pakolaisena Äiti<br/><br/>Toivoa kriisiaikoina: Äitienpäivän tarina<br/><br/>Kirjoittanut Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee kuuli, että sotilaat olivat tulossa. Hän tarttui poikaansa ja liittyi kuumeisesti muihin kyläläisiin, jotka juoksivat kohti Thaimaan ja Burman rajaa, jossa sijaitsi YK:n pakolaisasiain päävaltuutetun toimisto (UNHCR). Hänen miehensä oli toisessa kylässä juoksemassa vastakkaiseen suuntaan, Mee sai myöhemmin tietää. Sotilaiden takaa-ajon päätyttyä Mee palasi kotiin pieneen kyläänsä Burman Koechiin.<br/><br/>Vuosina 1997-2000 Mee ja tuhannet hänen kaltaisensa elivät Burman sotilaiden jatkuvan väkivallan uhan alla. Monet ihmiset hakeutuisivat väliaikaiseen turvaan viidakkoon ja palaisivat kotiin kyläänsä sotilaiden lähdettyä alueelta, vain tehdäkseen kaiken uudestaan päiviä myöhemmin. Noin kerran viikossa Mee ja muut olisivat liikkeellä välttääkseen sotilaiden vangitsemisen, raiskauksen tai kuoleman.<br/><br/>Erään välikohtauksen aikana Meen aviomies juoksi vaimonsa edellä turvaamaan perheelleen ruokaa, jonka sotilaat huomasivat ja ampuivat. Luoti murskasi osan hänen rintakehästään, jättäen hänet pahasti haavoittuneeksi ja hädässä, kun hän matkasi perheensä kanssa kohti viidakkoa turvaan.<br/><br/>Kolmen kuukauden ajan Meen mies piilotteli ja siirsi perhettä raivostuttava haava kyljellään, eikä hän saanut mitään lääketieteellistä hoitoa, paitsi Meen hoitamisen.<br/><br/>"Pelkäsin palata Burmaan", Mee sanoi tulkin kautta. "Pelkäsin kuolemaa. Itkin ja itkin joka päivä", hän jatkoi.<br/><br/>Meen aviomies veti lopulta tarpeeksi voimia kävelläkseen viisi päivää kohti Thaimaassa sijaitsevaa pientä kylää, jossa he saivat tietää sairaalan ja pakolaisleirin sijainnin. Kun Mee ja hänen miehensä lopulta saapuivat sairaalaan, hänelle tehtiin välitön leikkaus ja hän toipui myöhemmin.<br/><br/>Toivon symboli<br/><br/>Elämä viidakossa burmalaisia sotilaita pakeneville oli todella pelottavaa ja vaikeaa. Tilapäisistä bambuteltoista, joissa oli vain katto ja lattianpäällysteet, tuli sopivia väliaikaisia asumuksia. Monet naiset, myös Mee, synnyttivät lapsia viidakossa. Meen silloinen kuusivuotias poika avusti sisarensa Eh Ku Hserin synnytyksessä. Hänen nimensä merkitsee rakkautta – kylmää – makeaa. "Kylmä" Burmalaisessa kulttuurissa tarkoittaa sitä, että ei kulje elämän tulen läpi, sillä kuumuus edustaa levottomia aikoja.<br/><br/>"Toivoin, että tyttäreni olisi vapaa vaikeista ja huolestuttavista ajoista", Mee sanoi. "En halunnut hänen kokevan samaa kuin minä", hän jatkoi.<br/><br/>Meelle tyttären syntymä pimeyden, piinaamisen ja pelon keskellä oli toivon symboli tulevalle uudelle elämälle. Toivo kriisiaikoina, United Methodist Committee on Reliefin (UMCOR) juuri yhteisbrändätty UMCOR-Hyvinvointikynttilä, on myös sen ydin, mitä kynttilät valaisevat.<br/><br/>Uusi alku<br/><br/>UNHCR:n avulla toivo uudesta elämästä todella toteutui Meelle ja hänen perheelleen, kun he asettuivat asumaan West Springfieldiin Massachusettsiin. Siellä Mee tapasi Moo Kho Paw'n, toisen Burmasta muuttaneen naisen, joka työskenteli Prosperity Candlessa Firenzessä. Järjestö auttaa konfliktialueilta paenneita pakolaisnaisia rakentamaan elämänsä uudelleen kynttilänvalmistuksen taidon avulla. Moo Kho suositteli, että Mee liittyisi järjestöön, ja Mee otti sen mielellään vastaan.<br/><br/>"Olin innoissani ollessani poissa talosta", Mee sanoi, "Minut kasvatettiin uskomaan, että koska olin nainen, roolini oli pysyä kotona ja kasvattaa perheeni", hän jatkoi. "Vaikka monet burmalaiset naiset haluavat tehdä enemmän itsensä hyväksi, heitä kannustetaan usein pysymään kodinrakentajina."<br/><br/>Nykyään Meellä on suunnitelmia mennä kynttilänvalmistusalalle itselleen ja elättää viisi lastaan, mutta hän ilmaisi tarpeen oppia ensin englantia.<br/><br/>"Thaimaalaisessa pakolaisleirissä meillä oli koulutus, mutta se ei ollut kovin hyvä", sanoi Mee. "Kun olin lapsi, halusin mennä kouluun, mutta minua käskettiin jäämään kotiin, koska olin nainen. Nyt toivon tyttärieni menevän yliopistoon ja ryhtyvän lääkäreiksi tai poliisitytöiksi", jatkoi Mee.<br/><br/>Mee on löytänyt elämässään tasalaatuisen tasapainon, jonka hän toivoo muidenkin löytävän – yksinkertaisen, onnellisen elämän, jossa työllä, perheenjäsenistä huolehtimisella ja valinnanvapaudella on kaikilla paikkansa.<br/><br/>Pakolaisnaisten tukeminen Yhdysvalloissa<br/><br/>Jaa tämä äitienpäivän tarina rakkaidesi kanssa.

| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

This tone ventures farther across that thin line as she writes about the great female Queen Elizabeth | Edeltäjä Essay<br/><br/>1562 sanaa - 7 sivua<br/><br/>Myönteinen toiminta on hallituksen politiikkaa, joka antaa mahdollisuuksia vähemmistöille, naisille ja mille tahansa ryhmälle, joka on aiemmin joutunut syrjinnän kohteeksi. Myönteinen toiminta on seurausta 1960-luvun kansalaisoikeusliikkeestä, joka kasvoi ulos vuoden 1964 kansalaisoikeuslaista, joka kielsi rotuun, etniseen alkuperään tai sukupuoleen perustuvan syrjinnän. Se oli 1978 korkeimman oikeuden päätös, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, joka mahdollisti rotuun perustuvien preferenssien käytön keinona edistää monimuotoisuutta, jolloin myöntävää toimintaa voidaan käyttää tunnustuspolitiikassa. Se luotiin tarkoituksena tarjota tasa-arvoiset mahdollisuudet vähemmistöryhmien jäsenille koulutuksessa ja ...katso asiakirjan keskellä...<br/><br/>Pew Research Centerin vuoden 2007 raportin mukaan amerikkalaisen yleisön myönteisen toiminnan kannatus on kuitenkin kasvanut huomattavasti viime vuosina, nousten 58 prosentista vuonna 1995 70 prosenttiin vuonna 2007. Myönteisen toiminnan kannattajat esittävät monia argumentteja myönteisen toiminnan puolesta, toivoen saavansa muut näkemään sen aidon hyvän, jonka affirmative actin -politiikka tuo yhteiskunnallemme. Kannattajat uskovat, että myönteinen toiminta on pikemminkin prosessi kuin sisäänpääsypolitiikka. Korkeakoulut ja yliopistot tekevät ylimääräisen aloitteen vähemmistöryhmien tavoittamiseksi ja kannustavat heitä hakemaan. Korkeakoulut ja yliopistot tarjoavat ylimääräistä taloudellista tukea ja tarjoavat kampuksella resursseja, jotka auttavat parantamaan opiskelijan korkeakouluopetusta. Kannattajat toteavat myös, että vähemmistöön jäävien hakemusten määrä korkeakouluissa ja yliopistoissa kasvaa osittain myönteisen toimintapolitiikan vuoksi.<br/>Tilastot ovat osoittaneet, että kun myönteinen toiminta on poistettu, kuten silloin, kun se oli Berkley Collegessa ja UCLA: ssa vuonna 1998, vähemmistöopiskelijoiden tunnustukset laskivat 61 prosenttia ja 36 prosenttia, mikä osoittaa, että myöntävällä toiminnalla on suuri merkitys vähemmistöopiskelijoiden kollegion tunnustamisprosessissa. Myönteisen toiminnan kannattajat uskovat myös, että korkeakoulutuksen monimuotoisuus tarjoaa paremman koulutusilmapiirin kaikille opiskelijoille henkilökohtaisesti ja älyllisesti. Jos myönteinen toiminta poistettaisiin, oppilaitoksiin kirjoittautuvia vähemmistöopiskelijoita olisi vähemmän, jolloin monimuotoisuus olisi melko ohutta. Myönteiset toimintapolitiikat ovat myös välttämättömiä vuosisatojen rotuun, talouteen ja yhteiskuntaan kohdistuvan sorron kompensoimiseksi. Yksilöillä, joilla on korkeampi sosioekonominen asema, on enemmän mahdollisuuksia kuin sosioekonomisilla taustoilla. Kannattajat uskovat, että tietyt rodulliset tai etniset ryhmät ovat epäedullisessa asemassa, koska he ovat usein matalamman tulotason kotitalouksissa eivätkä siten altistu samoille resursseille kuin korkeamman sosioekonomisen luokan opiskelijat. Kannattajat kannattavat opiskelijoiden välistä kilpailua ansioiden perusteella, mutta väittävät, että myönteinen toiminta kompensoi taloudellisia eroja. Affirmative actionista hyötyneet korkeakoulututkinnon suorittaneet ovat myös sanoneet saaneensa parempia työpaikkoja, ansainneensa enemmän rahaa ja yleisesti eläneensä parempaa elämää niiden onnekkaiden mahdollisuuksien ansiosta, joita he ovat saaneet affirmative actionin kautta.<br/>Affirmative actionin kannattajat korostavat jatkuvasti affirmative actionin vakavaa merkitystä, kun otetaan huomioon sen panos sekä college-kokemuksen että yhteiskunnan parantamiseen yleensä. Affirmative actionin vastustajat uskovat kuitenkin, että on tullut aika lopettaa affirmative action. Vastustajat uskovat, että affirmative action luotiin varmistamaan oikeudenmukaiset maahanpääsykäytännöt, jotka tuovat muutoksen pitkään rotusyrjintään. He uskovat, että politiikka on vanhentunut."

Bradstreetille uhman teema on hyväksyttävä, kun kyse on fyysisen puhumisen kritisoimisesta jokapäiväisen elämän realiteetteja vastaan - mutta ei hyväksyttävää soveltaa henkiseen.

Katsojat 15 kampuksella sijaitsevilla katseluasemillamme nauttivat pääsystä pimennyksiin liittyviin asiantuntijoihin ja muihin koulutusmahdollisuuksiin nauttien turvallisesti auringonpimennyksestä. |
| Birthdays<br/><br/>Some people in your organisation may not wish to give you their birth date. Infoodle allows you to remove the birth year of a person! To do this:<br/><br/>When Adding a Person click the Hide Year button to remove the year of birth for the person.<br/><br/>Alternatively, when Editing a Person find the date of birth field for your site. Click the Edit button, then click Hide Year and save.<br/><br/>Easy as that!<br/><br/>Note: A person who has their birth year removed won't appear in any reports regarding an age criteria and is classed as an adult because their date of birth is actually set to 1902! The date of birth field is normally found in the information section but may have been<br/>moved under a different tab by your administrator. | Syntymäpäivät<br/><br/>Jotkut organisaatiosi henkilöt eivät välttämättä halua antaa sinulle syntymäaikaansa. Infoodle antaa sinun poistaa henkilön syntymävuoden! Voit tehdä tämän seuraavasti:<br/><br/>Kun lisäät henkilön, napsauta Piilota vuosi -painiketta poistaaksesi henkilön syntymävuoden.<br/><br/>Vaihtoehtoisesti, kun Muokkaat Henkilöä, etsi sivustosi syntymäaika. Napsauta Muokkaa-painiketta, valitse sitten Piilota vuosi ja tallenna.<br/><br/>Niin helppoa se on!<br/><br/>Huomautus: Henkilö, jonka syntymävuosi on poistettu, ei näy missään ikäkriteereitä koskevissa raporteissa ja hänet luokitellaan aikuiseksi, koska heidän syntymäaikansa on todellisuudessa asetettu vuoteen 1902! Syntymäaika-kenttä löytyy yleensä tieto-osiosta, mutta ylläpitäjä on saattanut siirtää sen eri välilehden alle. |
| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Yhdistelmät<br/><br/>Yhdistelmät Ovat puolustuksia lyöntiä vastaan, koreografioituja vastauksia erityyppisiin hyökkäyksiin. Heillä on monia nimiä taistelulajeissa, mutta (kokemukseni mukaan) jokaisessa taiteessa on versio niistä. Tämä tekee niistä erilaisia kuin muodot, koska on paljon taistelulajeja, joilla ei ole muotoja. Mikä tekee kumppaniharjoituksista niin yleismaailmallisia? Miksi harjoitella tiettyä vastausta, kun (todellisuudessa) ajoitus, hyökkäyksen tyyppi, hyökkääjän koko ja sata muuta tekijää tekevät siitä niin, ettet koskaan käytä koko koreografioitua vastausta? Ja lopuksi, miten voimme harjoitella todellista puolustustilannetta ja välttää loukkaantumisia samaan aikaan?<br/><br/>Yhdistelyjen universaalisuus on vähintäänkin vaikuttavaa. Kenpo karate -tyylissämme on 108 comboa, joita voi opetella. (Useimmat oppilaat oppivat kuitenkin vain 20-30) Brasilialaisessa Jiu-Jitsussa vietät kokonaisia tunteja harjoitellen käsipatukoita ja tukehtumisia, oppien jokaisen hienovaraisuuden liikkumiseen samalla kun kumppanisi tarjoaa vain vähän tai ei lainkaan vastarintaa. Jokainen nyrkkeilijä on viettänyt tuntikausia pussin ja/tai peilin edessä heittäen samaa iskuyhdistelmää, kunnes heidän kehonsa liikkuu pelkästään refleksin avulla. Yhdistelmät ovat universaaleja, koska meillä ei ole parempaa tapaa esitellä liikettä ja sitten harjoitella hienovaraisia asentoja, joita tarvitaan niiden saamiseksi toimimaan. Pienen painepisteen lyöminen vaatteiden läpi vaatii PALJON harjoittelua, käsitangon kiinnittäminen ohjauksella vaatii huolellisesti sijoitetun lonkan ja ovelan asennuksen, ja loistava yhdistelmä on hyödyllinen vain, jos sen läpi pääsee tasapainoisesta ja suojatusta asennosta. Keksitkö paremman keinon näiden taitojen hankkimiseen?<br/><br/>On olemassa useita tekijöitä, jotka määrittävät, miten vastaat hyökkäykseen ja onko sparrausottelussa tai tappelussa, en ole KOSKAAN käyttänyt täyttä yhdistelmää puolustuksessani. Miksi sitten käytämme tunteja harjoitellaksemme niitä? Harjoittelemme näitä koreografioituja vastauksia, koska tavoitteena ei ole vetää yhdistelmää 8 ulos joka kerta, kun näet koukkuiskun, vaan näyttää sinulle yhden tavan estää se ja sitten mahdollisen tavan seurata sitä. En ole koskaan päättänyt käyttää yhdistelmää 3 tositilanteessa, mutta lohko on yksi go-to-liikkeistäni. Yhdistelmät lisäävät työkaluja työkalupakkiin, jota ne eivät korjaa autoa.<br/><br/>Viimeinen kysymys on turvallisuus. Jos harjoittelemme todellisuuden vuoksi, meidän on toistettava todellisuus. Miten estämme loukkaantumisen, kun teemme niin? Kun se tulee alas, kyse on luottamuksen rakentamisesta. Aloitamme hitaasti ja opimme luottamaan siihen, että meillä on kontrolli itsestämme. Opimme luottamaan, että myös kumppaneillamme on kontrolli. Enemmän aikaa opimme luottamaan kontrolliimme kumppanistamme ja (hieman pelottavammin) opimme luottamaan kumppanimme kontrolliin meistä. Lopussa (paljon harjoittelua) voit liikkua täysillä, heittää kumppaniasi ja tulla heitetyksi ilman loukkaantumisen pelkoa.<br/><br/>Yhdistelmät ovat universaaleja syystä; niitä harjoitellaan, jotta ne voidaan leikellä osiinsa, ja pysymme turvassa aloittamalla hitaasti ja rakentamalla luottamusta. Kuten kaikessa muussakin kamppailulajissa, yhdistelmillä on monia syitä harjoitteluunsa ja teloitukseensa. |
