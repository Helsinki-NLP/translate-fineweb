| What is charisma and how to develop it? How to distinguish a charismatic person from a charming one?<br/><br/>One Answer<br/><br/>A charming person is someone you like, and a charismatic person is someone who impresses you with their abilities. A pleasant – looking person standing on the sidelines can be charming but not charismatic, and a commander who manages an army can be charismatic but not charming. | Mikä on karisma ja miten sitä kehitetään? Miten erottaa karismaattinen henkilö viehättävästä?<br/><br/>Yksi vastaus<br/><br/>Viehättävä henkilö on joku, josta pidät, ja karismaattinen henkilö on joku, joka tekee sinuun vaikutuksen kyvyillään. Miellyttävän näköinen henkilö, joka seisoo sivussa, voi olla hurmaava, mutta ei karismaattinen, ja armeijaa hallinnoiva komentaja voi olla karismaattinen, mutta ei hurmaava. |

| UNDERSTANDING SELF-EXECUTING TREATIES VIA STATE PRACTICE<br/><br/>Updated: Feb 2<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>Consider this paradox, when a country ratifies a treaty, it is said to have consented to accept the treaty in its entirety (reservations and declarations being exceptions); but in some cases, the countries go ahead and refuse to adhere to its provisions. For example, Article VI, Clause 2 of the American Constitution has the provisions that "all treaties … shall be the supreme Law of the Land." Although it is evident that treaties on their own do not have the same effect as federal laws. In truth, they only become operational once these provisions come into force as Federal law with Senate and Presidential approval. Although this is the practice, it is a generally accepted principle in international law that certain treaties have a binding effect on countries. The treaty must fulfil the requirement of being a self-executing treaty to affect the country without any corresponding domestic legislature directly.<br/><br/>This raises the question as to which treaty will qualify as "self-executing" and which will not?<br/><br/>Whether a treaty is a self-executing treaty or not is decided by national judges on a case-to-case basis (Buergenthal, 1992). In order to understand this, the paper will first look at the two types of theories followed by countries on the nature of treaties applying to domestic law. These two theories are monism and dualism. They basically view the framework of domestic and international law as a single hierarchy and two separate hierarchies, respectively (Wildhaber, 1971). Countries following monism believe that certain treaties immediately are binding and immediately have an effect on the country. Once the treaty has been ratified, it can be invoked in national courts and is considered to be a part of the law of the country. Countries following dualism believe that a treaty does not affect domestic law until it has been reinforced by a legislature passed in the parliament. An example of dualism is how the European Convention on Human Rights became operational in the United Kingdom after passing the Human Rights Act 1998 in their parliament (Laws, 2000).<br/><br/>International law is diverse, and so are the types of procedures different countries follow for the acceptance of treaties. Some constitutions' themselves mention the procedures for the ratification of a treaty. Some countries even have different treatment given to international treaty law and customary international law. Certain international organizations like the European Union often affect the domestic law of its member states. The member states of the European Union have to give effect to certain forms of community legislature. Although, it has an essential difference from self-executing treaties. The difference is that it is not for national judges to decide whether the provisions are self-executing or not, but rather for the European Court of Justice to interpret under its constitutive treaties. Other forms of international law formed via resolutions or such might not have the same effect for these states. Nevertheless, they might consider them as forms of "soft law" and look into them to interpret the intent of the law. Sometimes, proclamations made by the judicial organs of international organizations such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights affect their member states. Although these proclamations are not binding on the member states, the national judges seem to refer to these for authoritative interpretation.<br/><br/>Therefore, a case-to-case approach must be taken while analyzing the procedures and precedents set in different countries. To examine the concept of self-executing treaties, this paper will compare the precedents set by different jurisdictions. If the reader wishes to conduct a similar analysis, they can do so by looking into the different national yearbooks on international law. Mostly, these yearbooks will have a section devoted to the relationship between international and national law.<br/><br/>International Jurisprudence:<br/><br/>The most significant issue that comes up for national courts is whether the treaty is self-executing? If the treaty can be applied without any additional domestic legislature having passed to reinforce it. This question came up in the case of Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, wherein the Polish Constitutional Court held that since the treaty provisions referred to domestic measures to be taken, the treaty was not self-executing in nature (Bug river claims, Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, 2003). Essentially, when the treaty refers to domestic measures to be taken, it does not in itself create new obligations. It instead reinforces the treaty's intent for the domestic legal process to take measures for the same. A similar issue was raised in the Sosa case in the United States of America. In this case, the court considered whether the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was a self-executing treaty. The American Supreme Court has also declared that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is not a self-executing treaty (Court, 2004). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland also examined the self-executing nature of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The issue before the court was whether Article 13(2)(b) and (c) were self-executing in nature. The court examined whether the treaty was partially self-executing and did so by checking whether there existed a minimum core content for the treaty to be applicable. The court held that it found no such provision within the treaty (A and B v Government of the Canton of Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>It is essential to understand that these issues differ from the fundamental question of whether international law can be applied as part of the law of the land? In order to answer this question, the paper will examine the judgement by the Supreme Court of the Dominican Republic. The Supreme Court stated that Article 3 of the Dominican Republic's Constitution made international law binding on the domestic legal order. The court rejected the Superior Land Court's interpretation that these treaties were "foreign legislature" and not part of the domestic legal order. The Supreme Court laid down that all treaties ratified by the Dominican Republic formed a part of Dominican Law and, therefore, can be termed as self-executing (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland has examined whether the Libson Treaty was self-executing and directly applicable to Swiss Universities. The court held, "According to relevant case law, a treaty norm is directly applicable if its content is sufficiently precise and clear to form the basis of a decision in a particular case. The norm thus has to be justiciable, i.e. define the rights and obligations of an individual and be directed at the competent authorities" (X v University of Lucerne, 2014). This implies that whether the treaty is directly applicable or not, depends upon on whether the norm is justiciable. The Lisbon Treaty is based on the principle of qualifications acquired aboard. This is conveyed through Article IV (1) of the treaty. The purpose of this was to create an obligation for states to show that their decision-making process is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory. The responsibility for proving that the applicant has not met the required criteria is on the "body undertaking the assessment." The treaty guarantees procedural safeguards, which are generally accepted by countries and hence, the court held this treaty to be self-executing. This goes on to showcase the different interpretations undertaken by the courts of various countries.<br/><br/>It is essential to observe whether the norms set out by treaties are actually being complied with. The case laws from various jurisdictions have emphasized that national courts are the final authority on the issue of whether a treaty is self-executing. There is also an inherent duty cast on countries for the observance and due performance of treaties. Such is cast by the Pacta Sunt Servanda rule as enshrined within Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties (VCLT). Article 27 goes on to reinforce it by stating that international law obligations cannot be ignored by using domestic law as a justification. Many countries' courts have used this as a source of interpretation, such as the Latvian Constitutional Court. In the case of a national norm conflicting with an international norm, the court held that the national norm was null and void. To reach its conclusion, the court strongly relied on the necessary performance of treaties in good faith as envisaged in Article 26 of the VCLT (Linija v Latvia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>From the above, it is clear that treaties have particular requirements before they can be considered self-executing. However, keeping all of these aside, the most important still remains the national courts' interpretation. The national courts decide whether the treaty can be called self-executing or not. Although their Constitution's might contain a provision regarding treaty law being the supreme law of the land, courts from different countries interpret these provisions in different manners. This can be seen as to how the American and Dominican Constitutions' both contain these provisions but follow completely different interpretations of the same. The term "self-executing" may not be congruous for these treaties since, in practice, they still need approval from the national courts. Ideally, the way forward should be that countries acknowledge the self-executing nature of treaties and treat them in a fashion wherein Article 26 and 27 of the VCLT are respected. Again, this is the "ideal" situation and is not likely to find its way into state practice of certain jurisdictions anytime soon. Still, hope can be gained via looking into the interpretations of national courts that respect these norms and hopefully pave the way for other courts to acknowledge this.<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Esimerkiksi Yhdysvaltain perustuslain VI artiklan 2 kohdassa on määräykset, joiden mukaan "kaikki sopimukset ... ovat maan ylin laki." Vaikka on selvää, että sopimuksilla ei yksinään ole samaa vaikutusta kuin liittovaltion laeilla. Todellisuudessa ne tulevat käyttöön vasta, kun nämä säännökset tulevat voimaan liittovaltion lakina, jolla on senaatin ja presidentin hyväksyntä. Vaikka tämä on käytäntö, on kansainvälisessä oikeudessa yleisesti hyväksytty periaate, että tietyt sopimukset sitovat valtioita. Sopimuksen on täytettävä vaatimus siitä, että se on itseään toteuttava sopimus, joka vaikuttaa maahan ilman mitään vastaavaa kotimaista lainsäätäjää suoraan.<br/><br/>Tämä herättää kysymyksen siitä, mikä sopimus katsotaan "itsetoteuttavaksi" ja mikä ei?<br/><br/>Siitä, onko sopimus itsetoteutuva vai ei, päättävät kansalliset tuomarit tapauskohtaisesti (Buergenthal, 1992). Tämän ymmärtämiseksi tutkielmassa tarkastellaan ensin kahdenlaisia teorioita, joita maat seuraavat kansalliseen oikeuteen sovellettavien sopimusten luonteesta. Nämä kaksi teoriaa ovat monismi ja dualismi. He pitävät pohjimmiltaan kotimaisen ja kansainvälisen oikeuden puitteita yhtenä hierarkiana ja kahtena erillisenä hierarkiana (Wildhaber, 1971). Monismia seuraavat maat uskovat, että tietyt sopimukset ovat välittömästi sitovia ja vaikuttavat välittömästi maahan. Kun sopimus on ratifioitu, siihen voidaan vedota kansallisissa tuomioistuimissa, ja sen katsotaan olevan osa maan lakia. Dualismia seuraavat maat uskovat, että sopimus ei vaikuta kansalliseen lainsäädäntöön, ennen kuin se on vahvistettu parlamentissa hyväksytyllä lainsäädäntöelimellä. Esimerkki dualismista on se, miten Euroopan ihmisoikeussopimus tuli voimaan Yhdistyneessä kuningaskunnassa hyväksyttyään parlamentissaan vuoden 1998 ihmisoikeuslain (Laws, 2000).<br/><br/>Kansainvälinen oikeus on monimuotoista, ja niin ovat myös eri maiden menettelyt sopimusten hyväksymiseksi. Joissakin perustuslaeissa itse mainitaan sopimuksen ratifiointimenettelyt. Joissakin maissa jopa kansainvälistä sopimusoikeutta ja tavanomaista kansainvälistä oikeutta kohdellaan eri tavoin. Tietyt kansainväliset järjestöt, kuten Euroopan unioni, vaikuttavat usein jäsenvaltioidensa sisäiseen oikeuteen. Euroopan unionin jäsenvaltioiden on pantava täytäntöön tietyt yhteisön lainsäätäjän muodot, vaikka sillä on olennainen ero itse täytäntöön pantaviin sopimuksiin. Erona on se, että kansallisten tuomareiden tehtävänä ei ole päättää, ovatko säännökset itse toimeenpanevia vai eivät, vaan Euroopan yhteisöjen tuomioistuimen tehtävänä on tulkita niitä perustamissopimustensa nojalla. Muilla päätöslauselmilla tai vastaavilla muodostetuilla kansainvälisen oikeuden muodoilla ei välttämättä ole samanlaista vaikutusta näihin valtioihin. Siitä huolimatta ne saattavat pitää niitä "pehmeän lain" muotoina ja tutkia niitä tulkitakseen lain tarkoitusta. Joskus kansainvälisten järjestöjen, kuten Amerikan ihmisoikeustuomioistuimen, oikeuselinten julistukset vaikuttavat jäsenmaihin. Vaikka nämä julistukset eivät sido jäsenvaltioita, kansalliset tuomarit näyttävät viittaavan niihin arvovaltaista tulkintaa varten.<br/><br/>Tämän vuoksi on otettava tapauskohtainen lähestymistapa analysoitaessa eri maissa asetettuja menettelyjä ja ennakkotapauksia. Itsestään toteuttavien sopimusten käsitteen tutkimiseksi tässä asiakirjassa vertaillaan eri lainkäyttöalueiden asettamia ennakkotapauksia. Jos lukija haluaa tehdä samanlaisen analyysin, hän voi tehdä sen tutustumalla kansainvälistä oikeutta käsitteleviin eri kansallisiin vuosikirjoihin.<br/><br/>Kansainvälinen juridiikka:<br/><br/>Merkittävin kysymys, joka kansallisille tuomioistuimille tulee esiin, on se, onko sopimus itsetoteutuva, jos sopimusta voidaan soveltaa ilman, että mikään kansallinen lainsäädäntöelin on läpäissyt sen vahvistamisen. Tämä kysymys tuli esille asiassa Czeséaw S vastaan valtiokonttori ja valtiokonttoriministeri, jossa Puolan perustuslakituomioistuin katsoi, että koska perustamissopimuksen määräyksissä viitattiin toteutettaviin kotimaisiin toimenpiteisiin, sopimus ei ollut luonteeltaan omatoiminen (Bug river claims, Czeséaw S vastaan valtiokonttori ja valtiokonttoriministeri, 2003). Pohjimmiltaan kun sopimuksessa viitataan kotimaisiin toimenpiteisiin, se ei itsessään luo uusia velvoitteita, vaan vahvistaa sopimuksen aikomusta kotimaisen oikeusprosessin ryhtyä toimenpiteisiin saman puolesta. Samanlainen kysymys nousi esiin Sosa-jutussa Yhdysvalloissa, jossa tuomioistuin pohti, oliko kansalaisoikeuksia ja poliittisia oikeuksia koskeva kansainvälinen yleissopimus itsetoteutuva sopimus. Yhdysvaltain korkein oikeus on myös julistanut, että kansalaisoikeuksia ja poliittisia oikeuksia koskeva kansainvälinen yleissopimus ei ole itseään toteuttava sopimus (Court, 2004). Sveitsin liittovaltion korkein oikeus tutki myös kansalaisoikeuksia ja poliittisia oikeuksia koskevan kansainvälisen yleissopimuksen itsetoteuttamisen luonnetta. Tuomioistuimen käsiteltävänä oli kysymys siitä, olivatko 13 artiklan 2 kohdan b ja c alakohta itsetoteuttavia. Tuomioistuin tutki, oliko sopimus osittain itsetoteutuva, ja teki sen tarkistamalla, oliko olemassa vähimmäisydinsisältöä, jotta sopimusta voitaisiin soveltaa. Tuomioistuin katsoi, ettei se löytänyt tällaista määräystä perussopimuksesta (A ja B v.<br/><br/>On tärkeää ymmärtää, että nämä kysymykset eroavat perustavanlaatuisesta kysymyksestä siitä, voidaanko kansainvälistä oikeutta soveltaa osana maan lakia? Vastatakseen tähän kysymykseen lehti tutkii Dominikaanisen tasavallan korkeimman oikeuden tuomion. Korkein oikeus totesi, että Dominikaanisen tasavallan perustuslain 3. pykälä teki kansainvälisestä oikeudesta kansallista oikeusjärjestystä sitovan. Tuomioistuin hylkäsi Superior Land Courtin tulkinnan, jonka mukaan nämä sopimukset olivat "ulkomaista lainsäätäjää" eivätkä osa kotimaista oikeusjärjestystä. Korkein oikeus määräsi, että kaikki Dominikaanisen tasavallan ratifioimat sopimukset muodostivat osan Dominikaanista lakia, ja siksi niitä voidaan kutsua itsetoteuttaviksi (Gallardo Montilla v. Gallardo Concepcion and ors, 1997). Sveitsin korkein oikeus on tutkinut, oliko Libsonin sopimus itsetoteutuva ja suoraan sovellettavissa sveitsiläisiin yliopistoihin. Tuomioistuin katsoi, että "asianmukaisen oikeuskäytännön mukaan sopimusnormi on suoraan sovellettavissa, jos sen sisältö on riittävän tarkka ja selkeä, jotta se muodostaa päätöksen perustan tietyssä tapauksessa. Normin on siis oltava oikeutettu eli määriteltävä yksilön oikeudet ja velvollisuudet, ja se on suunnattava toimivaltaisille viranomaisille" (X v. Luzernin yliopisto, 2014). Tämä merkitsee sitä, että se, sovelletaanko sopimusta suoraan vai ei, riippuu siitä, onko normi oikeutettu. Lissabonin sopimus perustuu aluksella hankittujen tutkintojen periaatteeseen. Tämä välittyy sopimuksen IV artiklan 1 kohdan kautta. Tarkoituksena oli luoda valtioille velvoite osoittaa, että niiden päätöksentekoprosessi on oikeudenmukainen, avoin ja syrjimätön. Vastuu sen todistamisesta, että hakija ei ole täyttänyt vaadittuja kriteerejä, on "arviointia suorittavalla elimellä". Sopimuksessa taataan menettelylliset takeet, jotka maat yleisesti hyväksyvät, ja näin ollen tuomioistuin katsoi tämän sopimuksen olevan itsetoteutuva. Tämä osoittaa edelleen eri maiden tuomioistuinten tekemät erilaiset tulkinnat.<br/><br/>Olennaista on tarkkailla, noudatetaanko sopimuksissa asetettuja normeja todella. Eri lainkäyttöalueiden oikeuskäytännöissä on korostettu, että kansalliset tuomioistuimet ovat lopullinen auktoriteetti sen suhteen, onko sopimus itsetoteutuva. Valtioille on myös annettu luontainen velvollisuus valtiosopimusten noudattamiseen ja asianmukaiseen täytäntöönpanoon. Tällainen on valtiosopimusoikeutta koskevan Wienin yleissopimuksen (VCLT) 26 artiklassa vahvistettu Pacta Sunt Servanda -sääntö. Artikla 27 vahvistaa sitä toteamalla, että kansainvälisen oikeuden velvoitteita ei voida sivuuttaa käyttämällä perusteluna kansallista oikeutta, jota ovat käyttäneet tulkintalähteenä monien maiden tuomioistuimet, kuten Latvian perustuslakituomioistuin. Jos kansallinen normi on ristiriidassa kansainvälisen normin kanssa, tuomioistuin katsoi, että kansallinen normi on mitätön. Johtopäätöksensä tekemiseksi tuomioistuin tukeutui voimakkaasti sopimusten välttämättömään täytäntöönpanoon vilpittömässä mielessä siten kuin VCLT:n 26 artiklassa (Linija v. Latvia, 2004) on esitetty.<br/><br/>Johtopäätös:<br/><br/>Edellä esitetyn perusteella on selvää, että sopimuksilla on erityisiä vaatimuksia, ennen kuin niitä voidaan pitää itsetoteuttavina, mutta kaikkien näiden lisäksi tärkein on edelleen kansallisten tuomioistuinten tulkinta. Kansalliset tuomioistuimet päättävät, voidaanko sopimusta kutsua itsetoteutukseksi vai ei. Vaikka heidän perustuslakinsa saattaa sisältää määräyksen, jonka mukaan sopimusoikeus on maan ylin laki, eri maiden tuomioistuimet tulkitsevat näitä määräyksiä eri tavoin. Tämä voidaan nähdä siitä, miten Yhdysvaltain ja Dominikaanisen tasavallan perustuslaeissa molemmat sisältävät nämä määräykset, mutta noudattavat täysin erilaisia tulkintoja samasta. Termi "itsensä toteuttaminen" ei välttämättä sovi yhteen näiden sopimusten kanssa, koska käytännössä ne tarvitsevat vielä kansallisten tuomioistuinten hyväksynnän. Ihanteellista olisi, että maat tunnustaisivat sopimusten itsetoteuttamisen ja kohtelisivat niitä tavalla, jossa noudatetaan VCLT:n 26 ja 27 artiklaa. Jälleen tämä on "ihanteellinen" tilanne, eikä se todennäköisesti löydä tiensä tiettyjen lainkäyttöalueiden valtion käytäntöön milloin tahansa pian. Toivoa voidaan silti saada tarkastelemalla kansallisten tuomioistuinten tulkintoja, jotka kunnioittavat näitä normeja ja toivottavasti tasoittavat tietä muille tuomioistuimille tämän tunnustamiseksi.<br/><br/>Viitteet:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

| Behind-the-Scenes Tragedies That Affected the Cast of TV's Deadliest Catch<br/><br/>Lowered Fishing Quotas<br/><br/>Even though the crew on Deadliest Catch make the majority of their money from Discovery, that doesn't mean they don't actually sell their haul. So, you could say they have two sources of income, which is something that most people in their line of work don't have.<br/><br/>However, back in 2017, the Alaska Department of Fish and Game started a quota system, which limited the amount of fish any fishing boat could bring back to shore by half. That meant the crew on Deadliest Catch experienced a huge drop in profits for several years. Hey, at least they have Discovery to pay the bills, right? | Kulissien Takana Tragediat, Jotka Vaikuttivat TV: N Tappavimman Saaliin Valettuun<br/><br/>Alennetut kalastuskiintiöt<br/><br/>Vaikka Deadliest Catchin miehistö saakin suurimman osan rahoistaan Discoverylta, se ei tarkoita, etteivätkö he oikeasti myisi saalistaan. Voisi siis sanoa, että heillä on kaksi tulonlähdettä, mitä useimmilla heidän alansa ihmisillä ei ole.<br/><br/>Kuitenkin vuonna 2017 Alaskan kala- ja riistaosasto aloitti kiintiöjärjestelmän, joka rajoitti kalamäärän, jonka mikä tahansa kalastusvene voisi tuoda takaisin rantaan puoleen. Se tarkoitti, että Deadliest Catchin miehistö koki valtavan laskun useiden vuosien ajan. Hei, ainakin Discovery maksaa laskut, eikö? |

Whether it is a last-minute job request or a paper that you forgot to write and it is due the next day, stress can always find a way into your day if you allow it. Today I will show you a few things you can do to eliminate or prevent stress.<br/><br/>The first thing you can do is to exercise. Exercising is a great way to relieve stress because it lowers the stress hormone in your body known as cortisol. The lower levels of cortisol in your body, the lower your stress level will be. Exercise can also increase your confidence, and when your confidence is up then your stress is usually down. For me, when I get stressed, I always exercise by going to the gym and practice boxing, it helps me burn calories and reduce stress while having fun.<br/><br/>Writing things down has been a way to calm people down for a very long time, and it is the next topic on our list. Writing down what is making you stressed is a way to clear the mind, and it helps get rid of stress as well. I have a similar experience when writing stories, usually if I cannot think of a new idea because of an old one, I will write the old idea down and think on it. That is when new ideas start to spring up and I can continue writing normally. It is the same with stress. Think about a stream it continues to flow down it's path until it hits a beaver dam, and that dam blocks the flow of water and everything starts to build up. The only way to get the water flow back to normal is to remove the dam. This is where writing comes in. When you write it down, you are removing stress piece by piece until you can think normally again.<br/><br/>Stress can come into our lives through doors in our life that we keep open. Procrastination is a way that we can leave the doors open for stress. Waiting until tomorrow may be fun for today, but it will hurt you tomorrow, and is a very short-sighted solution. The longer you wait to do something, the larger that something becomes, and the larger it becomes the more stress you will be inviting into your life. Taking care of something as soon as we receive it is a great way to prevent stress, but it is something that takes great discipline to do. The more you cut Procrastination out of your life, the more stress free you will be. So shut that door, you're letting all the cold air out.<br/><br/>So let's review: Exercise, Write down what is stressing you, and Do not Procrastinate. These are only a few ways to relieve stress but to me, they are the most effective. While I know these may not work for everyone I would like to invite anyone feeling stressed to research how to get rid of it. | BLOGIT<br/><br/>Katso kokoelmistamme muiden henkilökunnan jäsenten kirjoittamia blogeja.<br/><br/>TIEDOTUSBLOGIT<br/><br/>Älä stressaa<br/><br/>mukaan<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>12 marraskuun, 2020<br/><br/>Stressi, riippumatta siitä, kuinka suuret asiat ovat menossa, se voi aina löytää keinon nostaa rumaa päätään. Olipa kyseessä viime hetken työpyyntö tai paperi, jonka unohdit kirjoittaa, ja se johtuu seuraavasta päivästä, stressi voi aina löytää tien päiväsi, jos sallit sen. Tänään näytän sinulle muutamia asioita, joita voit tehdä stressin poistamiseksi tai ehkäisemiseksi.<br/><br/>Ensimmäinen asia, jonka voit tehdä, on käyttää. Liikunta on loistava tapa lievittää stressiä, koska se alentaa kehon stressihormonia, joka tunnetaan kortisolina. Mitä alhaisempi kortisolin taso elimistössä, sitä alhaisempi stressitaso on. Liikunta voi myös lisätä itseluottamusta, ja kun itseluottamuksesi on ylhäällä, stressi on yleensä alhaalla. Minulle, kun saan stressaantunut, olen aina käyttää käymällä kuntosalilla ja harjoitella nyrkkeily, se auttaa minua polttaa kaloreita ja vähentää stressiä samalla hauskaa.<br/><br/>Asioiden kirjoittaminen muistiin on ollut tapa rauhoittaa ihmisiä hyvin pitkään, ja se on seuraava aihe listallamme. Se, mikä saa sinut stressaantumaan, on tapa tyhjentää mieli, ja se auttaa myös pääsemään eroon stressistä. Minulla on samanlainen kokemus tarinoita kirjoittaessani, yleensä jos en vanhan vuoksi keksi uutta ideaa, kirjoitan vanhan idean muistiin ja mietin sitä. Silloin uusia ideoita alkaa kehkeytyä ja voin jatkaa kirjoittamista normaalisti. Se on sama stressin kanssa. Ajattele virtaa, jota se jatkaa virtaamaan polkuaan pitkin, kunnes se osuu majavan patoon, ja että pato estää veden virtauksen ja kaikki alkaa kerääntyä. Ainoa tapa saada veden virtaus takaisin normaaliksi on poistaa pato. Kun kirjoitat sen ylös, poistat stressiä pala palalta, kunnes pystyt taas ajattelemaan normaalisti.<br/><br/>Stressi voi tulla elämäämme ovien kautta, joita pidämme auki. Viivyttely on tapa, jolla voimme jättää ovet auki stressille. Huomiseen odottaminen voi olla hauskaa tänään, mutta se satuttaa sinua huomenna, ja se on hyvin lyhytnäköinen ratkaisu. Mitä kauemmin odotat tehdäksesi jotain, sitä suuremmaksi jokin tulee ja mitä suuremmaksi se tulee, sitä enemmän stressiä kutsut elämääsi. Huolehtiminen jostain heti kun saamme sen on loistava tapa ehkäistä stressiä, mutta se on jotain, joka vie suurta kurinalaisuutta tehdä. Mitä enemmän leikkaat vitkastelua elämästäsi, sitä enemmän stressiä vapaa olet. Joten sulje ovi, päästät kaiken kylmän ilman ulos.<br/><br/>Joten tarkastellaan: Liikunta, Kirjoita ylös, mikä sinua stressaa, ja Älä viivyttele. Nämä ovat vain muutamia tapoja lievittää stressiä, mutta minulle ne ovat tehokkaimpia. Vaikka tiedän, että nämä eivät välttämättä toimi kaikille, haluaisin kutsua kaikki stressaantuneet tutkimaan, miten päästä eroon siitä. |
