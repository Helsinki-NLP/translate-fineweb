| The Masterpiece: a Chain Poetry Challenge<br/><br/>John has been writing poetry since his school days. He was awarded the "Best Poet 2014 and 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet in a Japanese kimono, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>A Brief History of Collaborative, Collective, or Chain Poetry<br/><br/>Collaborative,collective, or chain poetry is an alternative and creative technique for writing poetry by more than one person. The principal aim of this type of poetry is to create poems through the collaboration of various authors/poets, trying to form a unified voice while still maintain their individual voices.<br/><br/>Examples of collaboration abound in Japanese poetry. Though the precise accounts and records of many such events are either lost or missing.<br/><br/>One of the most famous examples of collective poetry writing was the poem collection titled Ralentir Travaux by Surrealist French poets André Breton, Paul Éluard and René Char. These three poets collaborated to write the poems in this collection over just five days in 1930.<br/><br/>During the 1940s, Charles Henri Ford, an American poet, invented what he called the "chain poem", where each poet wrote a line and then sent the poem to another person (to continue) in another part of the world, by post.<br/><br/>In 2007 a collection of American collaborative poetry Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry was edited and published by Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton and David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Collaborative poetry writing has been used in schools and colleges to teach students teamwork and to discover ways in which they are connected.(source: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>Study of a Figure Outdoors: Woman with a Parasol, facing left, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain or Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Aim of This Article and How to Approach the Challenge<br/><br/>A few years back I wrote an article called "Poem Without an End" which included a Christmas poem I had written that lent itself to being added to. I was amazed by the response as at that stage I only had a few followers here. People wrote a stanza of poetry each in "comments" on the hub to follow on from the previous commenter's stanza. It worked out very well and at the end I compiled all the contributions into a single poem as part of the hub.<br/><br/>Similar challenges have been issued since, including one by Frank Atanacio called "Spirits Sat as Mourners" that was also very successful. The difference being that in that instance contributors wrote their own hubs for their stanza of poetry and placed a link on Frank's original hub.<br/><br/>For this particular challenge I don't expect everyone to spend valuable time writing separate hubs for one stanza of poetry (unless you really want to). The main problem being that to make it effective you would have to copy the previously written parts of the poem onto your hub and would probably be hit with "duplication" label.<br/><br/>So, that being the case, and also to save having to leave links everywhere, I just ask that anyone who wants to take part just write their stanza here in "comments." Check the last comment before yours that is contributing to the challenge and follow on. If I see more than one following from the same stanza I will use my poetic licence to work them in as I deem best.<br/><br/>At some stage when I feel there has been enough stanzas added I will probably call an end to the challenge and then compile them all together as the completed poem as part of the article (also giving credit to each contributor).<br/><br/>Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Challenge!<br/><br/>Now comes the interesting part. If you join this chain poetry challenge you have to try to keep the style and voice of the poem as close as possible to the preceding verses, so that to uninformed readers it will appear that only one author has written the entire poem.<br/><br/>Sounds easy, you say? Well maybe it would be if the poem had a traditional style, rhyme or meter. But this one doesn't! The poem you will be adding to was started by an acquaintance of mine Andriealphus as a "chain poem challenge" elsewhere. At the time of writing I was the only other person who had accepted the challenge, and because I loved the subject I thought it would be a great challenge for my fellow writers and decided to use it here and see if the response would be better. (I know of a few poets here whose writing would suit this style)<br/><br/>Rules :<br/><br/>Follow on from the previous stanza in comments<br/><br/>Try to retain the voice and style of the poem<br/><br/>Keep your stanza/verse to approximately the same length as those before<br/><br/>Claude Monet was one of the most famous painters in the history of art and a leading figure in the Impressionist movement.<br/><br/>In 1883 Monet moved to Giverny. Here, he loved to paint outdoors in the gardens that he helped create. The water lilies found in the pond had a particular appeal, and he painted several series of them throughout the rest of his life; the Japanese-style bridge over the pond became the subject of several works, as well.<br/><br/>In 1912 Monet painted a series of 12 waterlily paintings commissioned by the Orangerie des Tuileries, a museum in Paris. He chose to make them on a very large scale, and to serve as a "haven of peaceful meditation." This project consumed much of Monet's later years. Monet once stated, "These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me. It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel."<br/><br/>His health was now an obstacle, as well. Nearly blind, with both of his eyes seriously affected by cataracts, Monet finally agreed to undergo surgery for the ailment in 1923.<br/><br/>Monet's famous water lilies turned redder as his cataracts progressed. After getting corrective surgery he destroyed most of the "red lily" paintings, angry that no one really mentioned it to him. Ironically, these paintings were probably what made his impressionistic style so famous in that time -- artists started taking more risks with color and such during this point. (source: biography.com)<br/><br/>The Masterpiece<br/><br/>"The boy sitting behind you says you look like a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ask him, has he ever seen a Monet up close?<br/><br/>Close enough to see nothing but muddled strokes of weedy lakeshore?<br/><br/>Close enough to dip his fingers into the ridges<br/><br/>where oil paints hardened under an artist's gaze?<br/><br/>Close enough to breathe onto the blood lilies?<br/><br/>Ask him, why did he paint them red?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>He grinned like Carroll's cheshire cat.<br/><br/>"Through clouded and bloodshot eyes I imagine.<br/><br/>Be my waterlilies!" he says,<br/><br/>"Feel my breath and let my fingers delve,<br/><br/>become my masterpiece instead.<br/><br/>A brush has never touched a canvas as fine as your fair skin.<br/><br/>Let the masters weep in jealousy,<br/><br/>and Van Gogh slice his ear in envy at the beauty of your nakedness."(Jodah)<br/><br/>Self portrait with bandaged ear<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Responses<br/><br/>Now it's your turn. Please write your response in the comments below, remembering to check those immediately before yours for the last written stanza of the poem. If you do decide to write a separate hub for your stanza of verse, make sure you leave a link here in comments.<br/><br/>The Finished Masterpiece<br/><br/>All contributions have been received and I have put the finished poem together with only some slight edits. I hope everyone is happy with the result.

And the beauty we can still enjoy today from all his work.<br/><br/>This is a great challenge! I am really looking forward to adding to this.<br/><br/>I first wanted to stop in and let you know that, up for sure. Shared too.<br/><br/>And thank you so much for all the challenges to help the rest of us, keep our mental energy flowing and giving it a work out! You are the best.<br/><br/>The information about LuLu and the free ISBN number is an answered prayer! So, smile my friend. You are a gift!<br/><br/>Hugs. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Marj. I think I may have all the verses that are going to come. I have been doing my best to arrange them as I think best with just a little editing. I will probably post the finished poem as a separate hub with a link on this one to it. My book is available on Lulu and iBooks...there's a link on one of the earlier comments. I'd really appreciate it if you were to purhase a copy. Bear in mind it's my first eBook so the formatting etc isn't perfect, but it's taken me seven revisions I think to get it where it is. It will all be easier next time. If you need help let me know.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John, you have certainly had some excellent responses to your challenge - I'm sure you'll fuse it altogether beautifully although I imagine a difficult task. I'm interested in your poetry books also - I really have to get my act together technologically - I'll try and check it all out...cheers -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, both books 'On the Wings of Eagles" and "I Laughed a Smile" have mostly the same content...except the former has one extra poem. Originally they were in different formats, one ePub, the other PDF but now they are both ePub. They are available through Lulu and iBooks, soon Barnes and Noble and Nook (not Amazon). I may try publishing another book through Amazon soon just to see how it compares. Thanks again.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thanks a lot, the info on publishing with Lulu will be quite useful as I'm thinking of publishing but I'm currently torn between Amazon and Lulu. I wanted to purchase one of your books, but I couldn't seem to find them on Amazon. However, I'll probably get it from Lulu. Wishing you every success, you deserve it.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hey Phyllis, thanks for ontributing. I like it, a perfect ending to the poem I think.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, I think I have sorted out the poem satisfactorily. Just waiting to see if there is any more to add. Publishing with Lulu wasn't bad and now that I've done it once it will be easier next time. Getting the formatting to look right in the eBook was the hardest, though you and just type it in a word document and Lulu automatically produces the contents page and converts the document to ePub or PDF you can only use certain fonts and have to make sure the chapter names or poem titles are in Heading 1. They also provide a free ISBN number if you want. Overall it was easier than expected however.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, this is succinct and beautiful, I love it. Shyron's did an excellent job also, I thought I'd already commented on her verse, but I hadn't.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns from High desert of Nevada. on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Wonderful hub, great idea, Jodah. Here is one from me. Short but sweet. Hope it is okay:<br/><br/>And this the beauty be<br/><br/>From Masters past we see<br/><br/>Impressed upon the boy<br/><br/>Bestowed on her with joy<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks John and Jo. You are kind. Jo, you have always been a brilliant poet. I, too, am looking forward to the end result after John does his magic to pull it all together.<br/><br/>I will share again to see if there are any more takers.<br/><br/>Blessings<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Faith, beautifully done, I find it incredible how someone with such limited vision can teach us so much about beauty, light and shadows. John, looking forward to reading the end result.<br/><br/>By the way, congtats on publishing your poems. How did you find the process of publishing with Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for your great submission Faith. No it's not too late, I'm still compiling the final poem so it should be up for all to see in a day or two.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John,<br/><br/>I apologize for my late submission here to your wonderful challenge. I am off from work a couple of day and decided to give this a go while my husband is resting from knee surgery. If it does not meet with your standards, please feel free to not use it in your final poem or edit as you deem necessary.<br/><br/>Blessings always<br/><br/>Here it goes:<br/><br/>Confessions to friend Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>Of light encapsulating both torment, joy<br/><br/>Fervent madness in analyzing colors<br/><br/>Consequential spontaneous creations<br/><br/>Season after season of obsession<br/><br/>Capturing different hues in a single moment<br/><br/>Attentive while strolling in Argenteuill<br/><br/>Brushwork bares masterpiece.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 09, 2015:<br/><br/>Just a shout out to see if anyone else still wants to contribute to this chain poem. I have started compiling the stanzas together but will leave it open for a couple more days in case anyone else is intending to join in. Thanks to all who have contributed.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Genna. It appears Monet is a favourite arist of many here. I hope you'll take part in this challenge too :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you for a great contribution Shyron. This is a very nice verse. Well done.<br/><br/>Genna East from Massachusetts, USA on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John...<br/><br/>I started to read this wonderful challenge (Monet is one of my favorite artists), then came back to finish reading some of the beautiful contributions that give this painting a stunning voice through perception and the senses.

I'm so glad you like my contribution. This is a very good idea, I know you'll have fun putting it all together. Take care and my best to you.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Deb, yes I am impressed by the standard of submissions. I'm looking forward to putting it all together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Ann, it is good to see the poets among us take up the challenge with some great contributions so far. I just hope Imcan do it justice when it comes to putting it together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Well done Jo. The word "sublime" comes to mind. I hoped all the poets would rise to the fore, and they have. Love it, thanks for contributing.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt from Stillwater, OK on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>I am excited to see what you end up with here. There are a number of fine poets rising to the challenge, so go to it!<br/><br/>Ann Carr from SW England on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Great one, Jo!<br/><br/>You've got everyone going, John! Rather you than me, putting all this together, but it's going to be a humdinger of a poem when it finally comes to an end - if it ever does! You've really started something.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John here goes nothing! Following from Kim's. I hope it reads well.<br/><br/>And the boy began to walk away<br/><br/>But in his wake, I heard him say<br/><br/>"I took a trip to Orangerie<br/><br/>Where the ghost of Monet still abides<br/><br/>I sat right down and gazed awhile<br/><br/>Until I heard a soft voice cry.<br/><br/>"Have you ever seen a fluid dream?<br/><br/>Where light evolves into what it touch<br/><br/>Where serenity flows through cloudy veil<br/><br/>Where the magician's brush like lightening rush<br/><br/>Have you ever seen a sight sublime?<br/><br/>A child born of distorted illusion<br/><br/>This flowering pond that traps the light<br/><br/>That lift the heart and beckons the soul<br/><br/>An abstract pulchritude up close<br/><br/>Move back, behold; such tranquil delight."<br/><br/>I hope this is in line with what the others have done. Feel free to edit if needed. My best...<br/><br/>Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Alrighty!<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Jo, please do. Anyone is welcome to do more than one stanza. I may add another myself at some stage.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>John, I've decided to have a go, but it's about 16 lines, can I do it in two stanzas following on from Kim's wonderful submission? You can always edit it later.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, sorry to hear you are under the weather at the moment. I am not in a hurry to close this challenge so I'll keep it open until you are back firing on all cylinders and are able to contribute. You are one of the hubbers I was looking forward to getting a response from as I thought it would suit. Thank you for your kind words, and get well soon.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John I can't believe I almost missed your incredible challenged. This is something in which I would have loved to participate since Claude Monet is one of my all times favourite artist. Unfortunately, I must cry off. I'm a bit under the weather with a head full of cotton wool, or so it seems. If the challenge is still open when I get rid of this pesky flu I may give it a go, but I must say, the standard is exceptionally high. Maj took it to another level but all the submissions are brilliant. Kudos to you Andriealphus and the other writers who participated so far in this artistic and creative masterpiece.<br/><br/>My best always Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Maj, glad this poem inspired you, and yes it beats watching the cricket especially with the Aussie batsmen performing badly in this third test. It will be an interesting exercise for me to fuse all the stanzas together but should be good.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thank you, I'm most happy you like my offering. I found the poem intriguing and suddenly felt inspired to write my version in the same mode. I'm not sure I wrote a continuation from the stanza before (alwaysexploring) but I'm sure you will fuse it altogether when the time comes. Love all the responses. I haven't managed any creative writing for yonks, can't wait now to start over, just need some time. (beats watching the cricket too!!!) Cheers John, will be checking in -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for checking Dana. I am pleased with the quality of responses so far. I just have to wait and see how many more come in. The final,poem should be great.<br/><br/>Dana Tate from LOS ANGELES on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Just checking in to see how things are going, I can't wait for the finished product. I attended a poetry class and we did this also it was really fun.<br/><br/>ocfireflies from North Carolina on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>Thanks so much for providing the platform for without that it is easy to fall down.<br/><br/>; ) Kim<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Devika. I haven't seen you around in awhile, I hope all is well.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>Beautiful work Kim. It will follow on perfectly from Maj's as you answered the GIverny question. I am so pleased with the quality of responses so far.<br/><br/>ocfireflies from North Carolina on July 29, 2015:<br/><br/>John,<br/><br/>I had sent this earlier before travmaj's awesome contribution, but maybe it still works (I did a little tweaking)<br/><br/>following as opposed to prior--don't know if<br/><br/>I am making any sense.

Ele foi premiado com o "Melhor Poeta 2014 e 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet em um quimono japonês, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Domínio público], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Uma Breve História da Poesia Colaborativa, Coletiva ou em Cadeia<br/><br/>A poesia colaborativa, coletiva ou em cadeia é uma técnica alternativa e criativa para escrever poesia por mais de uma pessoa. O principal objetivo deste tipo de poesia é criar poemas através da colaboração de vários autores / poetas, tentando formar uma voz unificada, mantendo suas vozes individuais.<br/><br/>Exemplos de colaboração abundam na poesia japonesa. Embora os relatos e registros precisos de muitos desses eventos estejam perdidos ou ausentes.<br/><br/>Um dos exemplos mais famosos de escrita de poesia coletiva foi a coleção de poemas intitulada Ralentir Travaux pelos poetas franceses surrealistas André Breton, Paul Éluard e René Char. Estes três poetas colaboraram para escrever os poemas desta coleção ao longo de apenas cinco dias em 1930.<br/><br/>Durante a década de 1940, Charles Henri Ford, um poeta americano, inventou o que ele chamou de "poema em cadeia", onde cada poeta escreveu uma linha e, em seguida, enviou o poema para outra pessoa (para continuar) em outra parte do mundo, por correio.<br/><br/>Em 2007, uma coleção de poesia colaborativa americana Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry foi editada e publicada por Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton e David Trinidad.<br/><br/>A escrita colaborativa de poesia tem sido usada em escolas e faculdades para ensinar os alunos a trabalhar em equipe e descobrir maneiras pelas quais eles estão conectados.<br/><br/>Estudo de uma figura ao ar livre: Mulher com um guarda-sol, virada para a esquerda, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Domínio público ou Domínio público], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>O objetivo deste artigo e como abordar o desafio<br/><br/>Alguns anos atrás eu escrevi um artigo chamado "Poema Sem Fim", que incluía um poema de Natal que eu tinha escrito que se prestava a ser adicionado. Fiquei espantado com a resposta, pois naquela fase eu tinha apenas alguns seguidores aqui. As pessoas escreveram uma estrofe de poesia cada um em "comentários" no hub para seguir da estrofe do comentarista anterior. Funcionou muito bem e no final eu compilei todas as contribuições em um único poema como parte do hub.<br/><br/>Desafios semelhantes foram lançados desde então, incluindo um de Frank Atanacio chamado "Spirits Sat as Mourners", que também foi muito bem-sucedido. A diferença é que, nesse caso, os colaboradores escreveram seus próprios hubs para sua estrofe de poesia e colocaram um link no hub original de Frank.<br/><br/>Para este desafio em particular, não espero que todos gastem um tempo valioso escrevendo hubs separados para uma estrofe de poesia (a menos que você realmente queira). O principal problema é que, para torná-lo eficaz, você teria que copiar as partes previamente escritas do poema para o seu hub e provavelmente seria atingido com o rótulo de "duplicação".<br/><br/>Então, sendo esse o caso, e também para evitar ter que deixar links em todos os lugares, eu só peço que qualquer um que queira participar apenas escreva sua estrofe aqui em "comentários". Confira o último comentário antes do seu que está contribuindo para o desafio e siga em frente. Se eu vir mais de um seguidor da mesma estrofe, usarei minha licença poética para trabalhá-los como eu achar melhor.<br/><br/>Em algum momento em que eu sinto que houve estrofes suficientes adicionadas, provavelmente vou chamar o fim do desafio e, em seguida, compilá-los todos juntos como o poema completo como parte do artigo (também dando crédito a cada colaborador).<br/><br/>Hotéis próximos a: Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Domínio público], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>O Desafio!<br/><br/>Agora vem a parte interessante. Se você se juntar a este desafio de poesia em cadeia, você tem que tentar manter o estilo e a voz do poema o mais próximo possível dos versos anteriores, para que aos leitores desinformados pareça que apenas um autor escreveu o poema inteiro.<br/><br/>Parece fácil, você diz? Bem, talvez fosse se o poema tivesse um estilo tradicional, rima ou medidor. Mas este não! O poema que você estará adicionando foi iniciado por um conhecido meu Andriealphus como um "desafio de poema em cadeia" em outro lugar. No momento em que escrevi, eu era a única outra pessoa que havia aceitado o desafio, e porque eu amava o assunto, pensei que seria um grande desafio para meus colegas escritores e decidi usá-lo aqui e ver se a resposta seria melhor. (Conheço aqui alguns poetas cuja escrita se adequaria a esse estilo)<br/><br/>Regras:<br/><br/>Siga a partir da estrofe anterior nos comentários<br/><br/>Tente manter a voz e o estilo do poema<br/><br/>Mantenha sua estrofe/verso com aproximadamente o mesmo comprimento que os anteriores<br/><br/>Claude Monet foi um dos pintores mais famosos da história da arte e uma figura proeminente no movimento impressionista.<br/><br/>Em 1883, Monet mudou-se para Giverny, onde ele adorava pintar ao ar livre nos jardins que ele ajudou a criar. Os nenúfares encontrados na lagoa tinham um apelo particular, e ele pintou várias séries deles durante o resto de sua vida; a ponte de estilo japonês sobre a lagoa tornou-se o assunto de várias obras, também.<br/><br/>Em 1912, Monet pintou uma série de 12 pinturas de nenúfares encomendadas pela Orangerie des Tuileries, um museu em Paris. Ele escolheu fazê-las em grande escala e servir como um "porto de meditação pacífica". Este projeto consumiu muito dos últimos anos de Monet. Monet uma vez afirmou: "Essas paisagens de água e reflexão se tornaram uma obsessão para mim. Está além da minha força como um velho, e ainda assim eu quero render o que eu sinto."<br/><br/>Quase cego, com os dois olhos seriamente afetados pela catarata, Monet finalmente concordou em se submeter a uma cirurgia para a doença em 1923.<br/><br/>Os famosos lírios de água de Monet ficaram mais vermelhos à medida que suas cataratas progrediam. Depois de receber uma cirurgia corretiva, ele destruiu a maioria das pinturas de "lírio vermelho", com raiva de que ninguém realmente mencionou isso a ele. Ironicamente, essas pinturas foram provavelmente o que fez seu estilo impressionista tão famoso naquela época - os artistas começaram a assumir mais riscos com a cor e tal durante este ponto.<br/><br/>A obra-prima<br/><br/>"O garoto sentado atrás de você diz que você parece uma obra-prima.<br/><br/>Pergunte-lhe, ele já viu um Monet de perto?<br/><br/>Perto o suficiente para ver nada além de traços confusos de lagos de ervas daninhas?<br/><br/>Perto o suficiente para mergulhar os dedos nas cristas<br/><br/>onde pinturas a óleo endurecidas sob o olhar de um artista?<br/><br/>O suficiente para respirar nos lírios de sangue?<br/><br/>Pergunte a ele, por que ele os pintou de vermelho?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>Ele sorriu como o gato de Cheshire de Carroll.<br/><br/>"Através de olhos nublados e manchados de sangue eu imagino.<br/><br/>Sejam meus lírios de água!", diz ele.<br/><br/>"Sente o meu fôlego e deixa os meus dedos cavarem,<br/><br/>Torne-se a minha obra-prima.<br/><br/>Um pincel nunca tocou uma tela tão fina quanto sua pele clara.<br/><br/>Que os mestres chorem em ciúmes,<br/><br/>E Van Gogh corta seu ouvido em inveja pela beleza de sua nudez.<br/><br/>Auto-retrato com orelha vendada<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [domínio público], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Respostas<br/><br/>Agora é a sua vez.

Se você decidir escrever um hub separado para sua estrofe de versos, certifique-se de deixar um link aqui nos comentários.<br/><br/>A obra-prima terminada<br/><br/>Todas as contribuições foram recebidas e eu coloquei o poema terminado junto com apenas algumas edições leves.

Eu acho que eu posso ter todos os versos que estão por vir. Eu tenho feito o meu melhor para organizá-los como eu acho melhor com apenas um pouco de edição. Eu provavelmente vou postar o poema terminado como um hub separado com um link sobre este para ele. Meu livro está disponível no Lulu e no iBooks... há um link em um dos comentários anteriores. Eu realmente agradecia se você fosse buscar uma cópia. Tenha em mente que é o meu primeiro eBook para que a formatação etc não é perfeito, mas levou-me sete revisões eu acho que para levá-lo onde está. Será tudo mais fácil da próxima vez. Se você precisar de ajuda deixe-me saber.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on Agosto 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Oi John, você certamente teve algumas excelentes respostas ao seu desafio - tenho certeza que você vai fundi-lo completamente lindamente, embora eu imagino uma tarefa difícil. Estou interessado em seus livros de poesia também - Eu realmente tenho que fazer o meu ato juntos tecnologicamente - Vou tentar verificar tudo isso...<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land em 11 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Oi Jo, ambos os livros "On the Wings of Eagles" e "I Laughed a Smile" têm principalmente o mesmo conteúdo... exceto o primeiro tem um poema extra. Originalmente eles estavam em diferentes formatos, um ePub, o outro PDF, mas agora eles são ambos ePub. Eles estão disponíveis através de Lulu e iBooks, em breve Barnes e Noble e Nook (não Amazon). Eu posso tentar publicar outro livro através da Amazon em breve apenas para ver como se compara. Obrigado novamente.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, U.K em 11 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>John, muito obrigado, as informações sobre publicação com a Lulu serão bastante úteis, pois estou pensando em publicar, mas estou atualmente dividido entre a Amazon e a Lulu. Eu queria comprar um de seus livros, mas não consegui encontrá-los na Amazon. No entanto, eu provavelmente vou obtê-lo de Lulu. Desejo-lhe todo o sucesso, você merece.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land em 11 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Ei, Phyllis, obrigada pela contribuição. Eu gosto, um final perfeito para o poema, eu acho.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land em 11 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Obrigado, Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land em 11 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Oi Jo, acho que resolvi o poema de forma satisfatória. Só estou esperando para ver se há mais alguma coisa a acrescentar. Publicar com Lulu não foi ruim e agora que eu fiz isso uma vez que será mais fácil da próxima vez. Obter a formatação para olhar para a direita no eBook foi o mais difícil, embora você e basta digitá-lo em um documento de palavra e Lulu produz automaticamente a página de conteúdo e converte o documento para ePub ou PDF você só pode usar certas fontes e tem que se certificar de que os nomes dos capítulos ou títulos de poemas estão no cabeçalho 1. Eles também fornecem um número ISBN gratuito, se você quiser. No geral, foi mais fácil do que o esperado, no entanto.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, U.K em 11 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, isso é sucinto e bonito, eu adoro. Shyron fez um excelente trabalho também, eu pensei que eu já tinha comentado sobre o verso dela, mas eu não tinha.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns do Alto Deserto de Nevada. em 10 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Maravilhoso hub, ótima ideia, Jodah.

John, ansioso para ler o resultado final.<br/><br/>A propósito, congtats na publicação de seus poemas. Como você encontrou o processo de publicação com Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land em 10 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Não, não é tarde demais, ainda estou compilando o poema final, então deve estar pronto para todos verem em um dia ou dois.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper do sul dos EUA em 10 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Olá, John.<br/><br/>Peço desculpas pela minha submissão tardia aqui para o seu maravilhoso desafio. Estou fora do trabalho um par de dias e decidiu dar a isso uma chance enquanto meu marido está descansando de cirurgia no joelho. Se ele não atender aos seus padrões, sinta-se livre para não usá-lo em seu poema final ou editá-lo como você julgar necessário.<br/><br/>Bênçãos sempre<br/><br/>Aqui vai:<br/><br/>Confissões a um amigo Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>De luz encapsulando tanto o tormento, a alegria<br/><br/>Loucura fervorosa em analisar cores<br/><br/>Criações espontâneas consequentes<br/><br/>Temporada após temporada de obsessão<br/><br/>Capturar diferentes tons em um único momento<br/><br/>Atencioso enquanto passeia em Argenteuill<br/><br/>Brushwork revela obra-prima.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land em 09 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Apenas um grito para ver se mais alguém ainda quer contribuir para este poema em cadeia.

Obrigado a todos que contribuíram.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land em 02 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Obrigado Genna. Parece que Monet é um arist favorito de muitos aqui. Espero que você vai participar deste desafio também :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land em 02 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Obrigado por uma grande contribuição Shyron. Este é um verso muito bom. Bem feito.<br/><br/>Genna East de Massachusetts, EUA em 02 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Oi, John.<br/><br/>Comecei a ler este maravilhoso desafio (Monet é um dos meus artistas favoritos), depois voltei para terminar de ler algumas das belas contribuições que dão a esta pintura uma voz deslumbrante através da percepção e dos sentidos.<br/><br/>Shyron E Shenko do Texas em 02 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Seguindo Jo (tobusiness)<br/><br/>"O branco puro da pele do lírio<br/><br/>Fala de nenhuma beleza de dentro<br/><br/>Apenas o caminho ou o objetivo de Monet<br/><br/>Para os olhos festivos<br/><br/>Não comendo para a alma"<br/><br/>Shyron<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land em 02 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Obrigado por retornar Kim, estou tão satisfeito com as respostas.

Cuide bem e o meu melhor para você.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land em 01 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Obrigado Deb, sim, estou impressionado com o padrão de submissões. Estou ansioso para colocar tudo junto.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land em 01 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Sim Ann, é bom ver os poetas entre nós aceitar o desafio com algumas grandes contribuições até agora. Espero que Imcan faça justiça quando se trata de montá-lo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land em 01 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Bem feito Jo. A palavra "sublime" vem à mente. Eu esperava que todos os poetas se levantassem para a frente, e eles têm. Amo, obrigado por contribuir.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt de Stillwater, OK em 01 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Estou animado para ver o que você acaba aqui. Há uma série de bons poetas que se levantam para o desafio, então vá para ele!<br/><br/>Ann Carr de SW England em 01 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Ótimo, Jo!<br/><br/>Você tem todo mundo indo, John! Em vez de você do que eu, colocando tudo isso juntos, mas vai ser um zumbido de um poema quando finalmente chegar ao fim - se alguma vez faz! Você realmente começou algo.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, U.K em 01 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John aqui não vai nada! Seguindo de Kim. Espero que leia bem.<br/><br/>E o menino começou a se afastar<br/><br/>Mas em seu rastro, eu o ouvi dizer<br/><br/>"Eu fiz uma viagem à Orangerie<br/><br/>Onde o fantasma de Monet ainda mora<br/><br/>Sentei-me direito e olhei por um tempo<br/><br/>Até que ouvi um grito de voz suave.<br/><br/>"Você já viu um sonho fluido?<br/><br/>Onde a luz evolui para o que toca<br/><br/>Onde a serenidade flui através do véu nublado<br/><br/>Onde o pincel do mago como um raio corre<br/><br/>Você já viu uma visão sublime?<br/><br/>Uma criança nascida de uma ilusão distorcida<br/><br/>Esta lagoa florida que prende a luz<br/><br/>Que eleva o coração e chama a alma<br/><br/>Uma pulchritude abstrata de perto<br/><br/>Afasta-te, eis que é uma delícia tão tranqüila."<br/><br/>Espero que isso esteja de acordo com o que os outros fizeram. Sinta-se livre para editar se necessário. Meu melhor...<br/><br/>Sim, senhor.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, U.K em 01 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Tudo bem.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land em 01 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>Sim Jo, por favor, faça. Qualquer um é bem-vindo para fazer mais de uma estrofe. Eu posso adicionar outro eu mesmo em algum estágio.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, U.K em 01 de agosto de 2015:<br/><br/>John, eu decidi ter um go, mas é cerca de 16 linhas, posso fazê-lo em duas estrofes após a submissão maravilhosa de Kim? Você sempre pode editá-lo mais tarde.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land em 31 de julho de 2015:<br/><br/>Oi Jo, desculpe ouvir que você está sob o clima no momento. Eu não estou com pressa para fechar este desafio, por isso vou mantê-lo aberto até que você está de volta em todos os cilindros e são capazes de contribuir. Você é um dos hubbers que eu estava ansioso para obter uma resposta de como eu pensei que seria adequado. Obrigado por suas amáveis palavras, e ficar bem em breve.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues de Lincolnshire, Reino Unido em 31 de julho de 2015:<br/><br/>Uau! John Eu não posso acreditar que eu quase perdi o seu incrível desafiado. Isso é algo em que eu adoraria participar, já que Claude Monet é um dos meus artistas favoritos de todos os tempos. Infelizmente, eu tenho que chorar. Eu estou um pouco debaixo do tempo com uma cabeça cheia de algodão, ou assim parece. Se o desafio ainda está aberto quando eu me livrar desta gripe irritante eu posso dar-lhe uma chance, mas devo dizer, o padrão é excepcionalmente alto. Maj levou isso para outro nível, mas todas as submissões são brilhantes. Saudações a você Andriealphus e aos outros escritores que participaram até agora desta obra-prima artística e criativa.<br/><br/>Meu melhor sempre, Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land em 31 de julho de 2015:<br/><br/>Oi novamente Maj, feliz que este poema inspirou você, e sim ele bate assistindo ao críquete especialmente com os batedores australianos executando mal neste terceiro teste. Será um exercício interessante para mim para fundir todas as estrofes juntos, mas deve ser bom.<br/><br/>travmaj de australia em 30 de julho de 2015:<br/><br/>John, obrigado, estou muito feliz que você goste da minha oferta. Achei o poema intrigante e de repente me senti inspirado a escrever minha versão no mesmo modo. Não tenho certeza se escrevi uma continuação da estrofe antes (sempre explorando), mas tenho certeza que você vai fundi-la completamente quando chegar a hora. Amo todas as respostas. Eu não consegui qualquer escrita criativa para yonks, mal posso esperar agora para começar de novo, só precisa de algum tempo. (bateu assistindo o críquete também!!!) Cheers John, estará verificando em -<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land em 30 de julho de 2015:<br/><br/>Obrigado por verificar Dana. Estou satisfeito com a qualidade das respostas até agora. Eu só tenho que esperar e ver quantos mais vêm. O final,poema deve ser ótimo.<br/><br/>Dana Tate de LOS ANGELES em 30 de julho de 2015:<br/><br/>Apenas checando para ver como as coisas estão indo, eu não posso esperar para o produto acabado. Eu assisti a uma aula de poesia e fizemos isso também foi muito divertido.<br/><br/>Ocfireflies da Carolina do Norte em 29 de julho de 2015:<br/><br/>John.<br/><br/>Muito obrigado por fornecer a plataforma para sem que seja fácil cair.<br/><br/>; ) Kim<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land em 29 de julho de 2015:<br/><br/>Obrigado Devika, não te vejo há algum tempo, espero que esteja tudo bem.<br/><br/>John Hansen (autor) de Gondwana Land em 29 de julho de 2015:<br/><br/>Belo trabalho Kim. Seguirá perfeitamente do Maj's como você respondeu à pergunta GIverny. Estou muito satisfeito com a qualidade das respostas até agora.<br/><br/>Ocfireflies da Carolina do Norte em 29 de julho de 2015:<br/><br/>John.<br/><br/>Eu tinha enviado isso antes da contribuição incrível de travmaj, mas talvez ainda funcione (eu fiz um pouco de ajuste)<br/><br/>em oposição ao anterior - não sei se<br/><br/>Estou fazendo algum sentido. Se não funcionar, por favor sinta-se livre para excluir e eu vou tentar novamente. |

We also need to include infinite quantum systems so as<br/>to understand and simulate Bose gas and its phase transitions. But, there<br/>are also steps that must be taken far beyond the paradigm of EEQT.<br/>As we have emphasized so many times: quantum theory has yet<br/>to be understood in terms of a "non-linear classical theory." But what we mean by a "classical theory" is something much more advanced and more<br/>general than clasical mechanics or classical field theory. By a "classical theory" we mean first of all, a theory that is not based<br/>on probabilities from the start; a theory in which probabilities appear at a<br/>later stage, derived from the theory; derived perhaps, in a necessary way. Such a theory must not only specify the mathematical objects and their relations but also make "predictions".<br/>A classical theory is, in particular, a theory in which discrete events can happen, events that are "objective." They may be events that affect mainly the physical stratum, but they may be also "mental<br/>events," changes of states of "consciousness;" whatever they are, even if they<br/>are concerned with branchings of universes, - they DO HAPPEN.<br/>Such a theory, encompassing the quantum theory as we know it today,<br/>does not yet exist, but we can envisage its possible shape. Nothing serves better than an example, so let us give here an example of how<br/>such a theory can be construed.<br/>Imagine a theory developed a'la Einstein's unified field theory, but<br/>with variable metric signature, possibly with a complex causal web, multiple<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (see also [41]) bridges,<br/>time loops, nondifferrentiability, fractal structure, all of that additionally complicated by variable dimensionality of space and of "time" (cf [42]. Imagine such a theory to be able to accomodate all the four fundamental<br/>forces known to us, but it also involves an extra field, which is different<br/>from physical fields, and which is non-local in the sense that it does not<br/>survive taking a macro-average-limit when causal space-time<br/>structure of Einstein's general relativity is recovered. This extra field<br/>would be a place for "thought forms" and our theory would couple these<br/>thought forms to more "physical" levels of reality. The very concept of<br/>"time" would arise only in one particular limiting structure. Nothing<br/>prevents a theory of such a type to have mathematical structures rich enough to accomodate consciousness and mind. Due to its complexity,<br/>density of time-loops, bubble-like causal structure, making predictions<br/>in such theory is possible only by applying probability -<br/>as it is the case with systems evolving according to deterministic<br/>but chaotic dynamics. Quantum wave function would emerge in such a<br/>theory as an effective way of predicting. That type of explanation<br/>of quantum indeterminism was postulated long ago by I. J. Good. In<br/>[3] he speculated that<br/>quantum indeterminism can be understood if we admit that individual quantum events that actually happen here and now have future<br/>advanced causes as well has past retarded causes.<br/>A glimpse of such a thought<br/>may have occured to Alan Turing when he wrote his famous, already quoted sentence: "prediction must be linear, description must be nonlinear."<br/>A theory going partially in this direction is being developed by L. Nottale<br/>[43] who states the observation, attributed to Feynman, that "the typical paths of quantum mechanical particles are continuous non-differentiable." Then he continues his development of fractal<br/>space-time ideas to conclude with: "The quantum behavior becomes, in this theory,<br/>a manifestation of the fractal geometry of space-time, in the same way gravitation is, in Einstein's theory of general (motion-)relativity, a manifestation of the curvature of space-time.<br/>Another step in this direction comes from the work of Russian scientists - which started with the most original ideas of N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>and A. Sakharov [45], and is being developed in Moscow, the Urals and Siberia, see e.g. [46, 47, 48]. | Em primeiro lugar, a própria EEQT precisa ser desenvolvida para fornecer uma resposta teórica e computacional às necessidades da engenharia e tecnologia quântica moderna. Precisamos incluir sistemas clássicos com números infinitos de graus de liberdade - como campo eletromagnético e / ou gravitacional. Também precisamos incluir sistemas quânticos infinitos para entender e simular o gás Bose e suas transições de fase. Mas também há passos que devem ser tomados muito além do paradigma da EEQT.<br/>Como enfatizamos tantas vezes: a teoria quântica ainda não foi entendida em termos de uma "teoria clássica não linear". Mas o que queremos dizer com "teoria clássica" é algo muito mais avançado e mais geral do que a mecânica clássica ou a teoria de campo clássica. Por "teoria clássica" queremos dizer, em primeiro lugar, uma teoria que não se baseia em probabilidades desde o início; uma teoria na qual as probabilidades aparecem em um estágio posterior, derivadas da teoria; derivadas talvez, de uma maneira necessária. Tal teoria não deve apenas especificar os objetos matemáticos e suas relações, mas também fazer "previsões".<br/>Uma teoria clássica é, em particular, uma teoria na qual eventos discretos podem acontecer, eventos que são "objetivos". Eles podem ser eventos que afetam principalmente o estrato físico, mas eles podem ser também "eventos mentais", mudanças de estados de "consciência"; o que quer que sejam, mesmo que estejam preocupados com ramificações de universos, eles acontecem.<br/>Tal teoria, abrangendo a teoria quântica como a conhecemos hoje, ainda não existe, mas podemos imaginar sua possível forma. Nada serve melhor do que um exemplo, então vamos dar aqui um exemplo de como tal teoria pode ser interpretada.<br/>Imagine uma teoria que desenvolveu a teoria do campo unificado de a'la Einstein, mas com assinatura métrica variável, possivelmente com uma teia causal complexa, múltipla<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (ver também [41]) pontes, laços de tempo, não-diferenciabilidade, estrutura fractal, tudo isso adicionalmente complicado pela dimensionalidade variável do espaço e do "tempo" (cf [42]. Imagine tal teoria para ser capaz de acomodar todas as quatro forças fundamentais conhecidas por nós, mas também envolve um campo extra, que é diferente dos campos físicos, e que não é local no sentido de que não sobrevive tomando um limite macro-médio quando a estrutura espacial-temporal causal da relatividade geral de Einstein é recuperada. Esse campo extra seria um lugar para "formas de pensamento" e nossa teoria associaria essas formas de pensamento a níveis mais "físicos" de realidade.<br/>Nada impede que uma teoria desse tipo tenha estruturas matemáticas ricas o suficiente para acomodar a consciência e a mente. Devido à sua complexidade, densidade de laços de tempo, estrutura causal semelhante a bolhas, fazer previsões em tal teoria só é possível aplicando probabilidade -<br/>como é o caso com sistemas evoluindo de acordo com dinâmicas deterministas mas caóticas. A função de onda quântica emergiria em tal teoria como uma maneira eficaz de prever. Esse tipo de explicação do indeterminismo quântico foi postulado há muito tempo por I. J. Good.<br/>Ele especulou que o indeterminismo quântico pode ser entendido se admitirmos que os eventos quânticos individuais que realmente acontecem aqui e agora têm causas avançadas futuras também têm causas retardadas passadas.<br/>Um vislumbre de tal pensamento pode ter ocorrido a Alan Turing quando ele escreveu sua famosa frase já citada: "a previsão deve ser linear, a descrição deve ser não linear".<br/>Uma teoria que vai parcialmente nessa direção está sendo desenvolvida por L. Nottale.<br/>[43] que afirma a observação, atribuída a Feynman, que "os caminhos típicos de partículas mecânicas quânticas são contínuos não-diferenciais." O comportamento quântico torna-se, nesta teoria, uma manifestação da geometria fractal do espaço-tempo, da mesma forma que a gravitação é, na teoria de Einstein da (movimento-)relatividade geral, uma manifestação da curvatura do espaço-tempo.<br/>Outro passo nessa direção vem do trabalho de cientistas russos - que começou com as idéias mais originais de N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>e A. Sakharov [45], e está sendo desenvolvido em Moscou, nos Urais e na Sibéria, ver por exemplo [46, 47, 48]. |
| Best Nutrition And Exercise For Lose Weight<br/><br/>How is breakfast really healthy?<br/><br/>In the morning like an emperor, at noon like a king, in the evening like a beggar – goes a well-known proverb. A study by the medical organization Endocrine Society confirms the key message behind the saying: It shows that breakfast plays a more important role than is often assumed. In the morning, the human body actually has more than twice as high a metabolic activity as at other times of the day: A large breakfast not only keeps you full for a long time, blood sugar and insulin levels also rise slowly. The appetite for sweets is regulated, we eat snacks less often during the day. Therefore, breakfast should not be skipped even during a diet.<br/><br/>Of course, having a big breakfast doesn't mean that we should have several croissants with nut nougat cream and sweet breakfast pancakes in the morning. Breakfast is healthy best when it is high in protein and fiber, as well as providing vitamins and minerals. Whole grain bread or muesli, oat flakes, fruits and nuts are energy suppliers that are good for you and keep you full for a long time.<br/><br/>The fact that a large breakfast is better than a large dinner does not necessarily mean that breakfast is essential for losing weight. A meta-analysis carried out in 2019 showed, that the total daily energy intake of people who eat breakfast is on average higher, than that of those who do not have breakfast. The latter were on average just under half a kilo lighter. So, according to the results of this major study, you don't necessarily have to eat breakfast if you want to lose weight.<br/><br/>Lose weight with the right diet – that's how easy it is to put healthy on your plate<br/><br/>Eating healthy in no way means less taste. Fresh vegetables, fish or meat as protein sources and other healthy ingredients conjure up taste in the pot and a smile on your lips – ideally also when you step on the scales. A US study has shown that people who cook their own food and consciously deal with what they eat have a body mass index in the normal range. Restaurant visits or fast food, on the other hand, quickly lure you into the sugar trap: Often there is no indication of how much sugar is in salad dressings, how much fat the potatoes were fried in or whether the meat was not treated.<br/><br/>A healthy lunch consists of three parts – the largest part is fruits or vegetables and should cover half of the plate. A quarter of the meal should consist of protein, i.e. fish, meat or tofu. The remaining quarter consists of carbohydrates and is ideally made from whole grain products. Important: Don't eat at your desk in the office, but stimulate your metabolism and ideally take a short walk before or after lunch.<br/><br/>When should you eat to lose weight?<br/><br/>In the evening, you should focus on light meals that are rather low in carbohydrates. These are the least likely to cause insulin to skyrocket, which is good for our body. Vegetables, dairy products and nuts, for example, are well suited for this.<br/><br/>You should also be careful not to have dinner too late. It is best to have eaten until 7 p.m. – then the body can relax and prepare for the night. Sufficient sleep is important for healthy weight loss. A US study found that people who slept about eight hours a night had better fat deposits. So good night! Allow yourself more than six hours of sleep so that you can start the next day fit and refreshed.<br/><br/>Losing weight without exercise – is it really possible?<br/><br/>It would be so easy, if the dream weight could be achieved simply by lowering the calorie intake. But you probably know the wisdom that diet is only one side of the coin and exercise is the other. So nothing helps: Put on your sportswear and off you go!<br/><br/>Anyone who, in addition to the sports program such as jogging, walking or swimming, also lets the elevator go alone and takes the stairs, takes a little detour or uses the bike instead of the car, is doing wellis also called something good. Even simple walking is good for health. | Melhor Nutrição E Exercício Para Perder Peso<br/><br/>Como o café da manhã é realmente saudável?<br/><br/>De manhã como um imperador, ao meio-dia como um rei, à noite como um mendigo – diz um provérbio bem conhecido. Um estudo da organização médica Endocrine Society confirma a mensagem-chave por trás do ditado: mostra que o café da manhã desempenha um papel mais importante do que é frequentemente assumido. Na parte da manhã, o corpo humano realmente tem mais do que o dobro de atividade metabólica do que em outras horas do dia: um grande café da manhã não só mantém você cheio por um longo tempo, os níveis de açúcar no sangue e insulina também aumentam lentamente. O apetite por doces é regulado, comemos lanches com menos frequência durante o dia. Portanto, o café da manhã não deve ser pulado mesmo durante uma dieta.<br/><br/>Claro, tomar um café da manhã grande não significa que devemos ter vários croissants com creme de nougat de nozes e panquecas de café da manhã doces pela manhã. O café da manhã é melhor saudável quando é rico em proteínas e fibras, além de fornecer vitaminas e minerais. Pão integral ou muesli, flocos de aveia, frutas e nozes são fornecedores de energia que são bons para você e mantê-lo cheio por um longo tempo.<br/><br/>O fato de que um café da manhã grande é melhor do que um jantar grande não significa necessariamente que o café da manhã é essencial para perder peso. Uma meta-análise realizada em 2019 mostrou que o consumo diário total de energia das pessoas que tomam café da manhã é, em média, maior do que o daqueles que não tomam café da manhã. Estes últimos eram, em média, pouco menos de meio quilo mais leves. Então, de acordo com os resultados deste grande estudo, você não precisa necessariamente tomar café da manhã se quiser perder peso.<br/><br/>Perder peso com a dieta certa – é assim que é fácil colocar saudável no seu prato<br/><br/>Comer saudável de forma alguma significa menos sabor. Legumes frescos, peixe ou carne como fontes de proteína e outros ingredientes saudáveis evocam sabor na panela e um sorriso nos lábios – idealmente também quando você pisa nas escamas. Um estudo dos EUA mostrou que as pessoas que cozinham seus próprios alimentos e conscientemente lidam com o que comem têm um índice de massa corporal na faixa normal. As visitas a restaurantes ou fast food, por outro lado, rapidamente o atraem para a armadilha do açúcar: muitas vezes não há indicação de quanto açúcar está em molhos de salada, quanta gordura as batatas foram fritas ou se a carne não foi tratada.<br/><br/>Um almoço saudável consiste em três partes – a maior parte é frutas ou legumes e deve cobrir metade do prato. Um quarto da refeição deve consistir em proteínas, ou seja, peixe, carne ou tofu. O restante é composto de carboidratos e é idealmente feito de produtos de grãos integrais. Importante: Não coma na sua mesa no escritório, mas estimule seu metabolismo e idealmente dê uma curta caminhada antes ou depois do almoço.<br/><br/>Quando você deve comer para perder peso?<br/><br/>À noite, você deve se concentrar em refeições leves que são bastante baixas em carboidratos. Estes são os menos propensos a causar insulina para disparar, o que é bom para o nosso corpo. Legumes, produtos lácteos e nozes, por exemplo, são bem adequados para isso.<br/><br/>Você também deve ter cuidado para não jantar tarde demais. É melhor ter comido até as 19h – então o corpo pode relaxar e se preparar para a noite. Dormir o suficiente é importante para a perda de peso saudável. Um estudo dos EUA descobriu que as pessoas que dormiam cerca de oito horas por noite tinham melhores depósitos de gordura. Então, boa noite! Permita-se mais de seis horas de sono para que você possa começar o dia seguinte em forma e refrescado.<br/><br/>Perder peso sem exercício – é realmente possível?<br/><br/>Seria tão fácil, se o peso dos sonhos pudesse ser alcançado simplesmente diminuindo a ingestão de calorias. Mas você provavelmente sabe a sabedoria de que a dieta é apenas um lado da moeda e o exercício é o outro. Então nada ajuda: Coloque suas roupas esportivas e vá embora!<br/><br/>Qualquer pessoa que, além do programa esportivo como correr, caminhar ou nadar, também deixe o elevador ir sozinho e suba as escadas, faça um pequeno desvio ou use a bicicleta em vez do carro, está fazendo wellis também chamado de algo bom. Mesmo uma simples caminhada é boa para a saúde. |
| Why We Open Sourced the Anvil App Server<br/><br/>Why Open Source?<br/><br/>A little while ago, we open-sourced the Anvil App Server. The community reaction has been great, even a little overwhelming (yes, every reply to that announcement really did land in my inbox!). We've already incorporated a bunch of that feedback into our version 1.2 release. But we keep getting asked, " Why did you open-source such a core part of your product? "<br/><br/>Why do this at all?<br/><br/>Anvil is a tool that makes it as simple as possible to build a web app. We do that by enabling you to build the whole application in one language, Python.<br/><br/>Simple hosting is part of that.<br/><br/>The web platform is broken , and Anvil is our attempt to fix it. And, because there is so much complexity in deploying a web app, a cloud-hosted service was the best way to provide the simplicity we want. That way, you can build your app in the Anvil Editor, and make it live on the Internet with one click.<br/><br/>But we kept hearing from people who said, "that's great, but…"<br/><br/>"…but I need to run this on an offshore platform without reliable internet access"<br/><br/>"…but I want to package my app into an IoT device I sell"<br/><br/>or simply, "…but if I'm putting my eggs in this basket, how can I be sure I can still run my app in ten years' time?"<br/><br/>These are all good points! A cloud service isn't the right solution for everyone. If we want to serve these users, there's got to be some way for them to get their apps out of Anvil and run them locally, under their own complete control.<br/><br/>Open Source: Escape hatch, not an ejector seat<br/><br/>We believe in escape hatches, not ejector seats. At conferences, we sometimes get asked, "can I export this as a Flask+JS app?". Sure, it would be possible – we could generate a server package, compile the client-side Python to Javascript, and spit out a classic web app. But it would have serious drawbacks, because:<br/><br/>Not a comfy ride.<br/><br/>Code generation is an ejector seat. Generated code is better than nothing – at least you can edit it! But the moment you edit that code, you lose all the benefits of the system that generated it. If you're using Anvil because of its drag-and-drop editor and Python in the browser, why should our locally-hosted users have to use vim and Javascript?<br/><br/>So we did it the right way: we open-sourced Anvil's runtime engine. It's the same code that serves your app in our hosted service, and it represents your app the same way. You can edit your code with a text editor, run it, then git push it back into our online IDE. It's not an ejector seat: there's no explosive transition. It's an escape hatch: you can climb out, and climb right back in.<br/><br/>What about our business model?<br/><br/>Anvil was never meant to be one of those enterprise low-code systems that charge you $20/mo for each person who uses your app. Anvil is a developer tool. The apps you develop are yours. Enabling you to run them on a Raspberry Pi is cool, but it doesn't change our business model.<br/><br/>We're doing what we always were: We make and sell a development tool that makes it drastically simpler to build web applications. We provide hosting for Anvil apps. We offer the entire development-and-hosting platform on-site for enterprise customers. And, of course, we offer a free plan so that everyone can use Anvil for hobby or educational purposes – or to start building something and see how it goes.<br/><br/>We've open-sourced the Anvil App Server for the (relatively small) number of people who need it, and to provide the ultimate insurance policy. Sure, you can build an app with vim and host it yourself, without even registering an account with us (we've got docs to show you how!). But the Anvil Editor is the world's easiest way to build a web app, and our hosted service is the easiest way to deploy it – so that's what we expect most of our users to continue doing. And you can build with confidence, knowing that the open-source code is right there if you need it.<br/><br/>Try it yourself<br/><br/>If our development philosophy resonates with you, why not try Anvil yourself? | Por que abrimos o servidor de aplicativos Anvil<br/><br/>Porquê Open Source?<br/><br/>Há pouco tempo, nós open-sourced o Anvil App Server. A reação da comunidade tem sido grande, até mesmo um pouco esmagadora (sim, cada resposta a esse anúncio realmente pousou na minha caixa de entrada!). Nós já incorporamos um monte desse feedback em nossa versão 1.2. Mas continuamos sendo perguntados: "Por que você open-source uma parte tão central do seu produto? "<br/><br/>Por que fazer isso?<br/><br/>Anvil é uma ferramenta que torna a construção de um aplicativo web o mais simples possível. Fazemos isso permitindo que você construa todo o aplicativo em uma linguagem, Python.<br/><br/>A hospedagem simples faz parte disso.<br/><br/>A plataforma web está quebrada, e Anvil é a nossa tentativa de corrigi-lo. E, porque há tanta complexidade na implantação de um aplicativo web, um serviço hospedado em nuvem foi a melhor maneira de fornecer a simplicidade que queremos. Dessa forma, você pode criar seu aplicativo no Anvil Editor e torná-lo ao vivo na Internet com um clique.<br/><br/>Mas ficamos ouvindo de pessoas que diziam: "Isso é ótimo, mas..."<br/><br/>"...mas eu preciso executar isso em uma plataforma offshore sem acesso confiável à internet"<br/><br/>"...mas eu quero empacotar meu aplicativo em um dispositivo IoT que eu venda"<br/><br/>ou simplesmente, "...mas se estou colocando meus ovos nesta cesta, como posso ter certeza de que ainda posso executar meu aplicativo em dez anos?"<br/><br/>Esses são todos bons pontos! Um serviço em nuvem não é a solução certa para todos. Se quisermos atender esses usuários, deve haver alguma maneira de eles tirarem seus aplicativos do Anvil e executá-los localmente, sob seu próprio controle total.<br/><br/>Open Source: escotilha de fuga, não um assento ejetor<br/><br/>Acreditamos em escotilhas de escape, não em assentos ejetores. Em conferências, às vezes nos perguntam: "Posso exportar isso como um aplicativo Flask + JS?". Claro, seria possível – poderíamos gerar um pacote de servidor, compilar o Python do lado do cliente para o Javascript e cuspir um aplicativo web clássico. Mas teria sérias desvantagens, porque:<br/><br/>Não é um passeio confortável.<br/><br/>A geração de código é um assento ejetor. O código gerado é melhor do que nada – pelo menos você pode editá-lo! Mas no momento em que você edita esse código, você perde todos os benefícios do sistema que o gerou. Se você está usando o Anvil por causa de seu editor de arrastar e soltar e Python no navegador, por que nossos usuários hospedados localmente teriam que usar o vim e o Javascript?<br/><br/>Então fizemos isso da maneira certa: open-sourced o motor de tempo de execução do Anvil. É o mesmo código que serve seu aplicativo em nosso serviço hospedado, e ele representa seu aplicativo da mesma maneira. Você pode editar seu código com um editor de texto, executá-lo e, em seguida, empurrá-lo de volta para o nosso IDE on-line. Não é um assento ejetor: não há transição explosiva. É uma escotilha de fuga: você pode sair e subir de volta.<br/><br/>E o nosso modelo de negócio?<br/><br/>Anvil nunca foi destinado a ser um daqueles sistemas low-code corporativos que cobram US $ 20 / mês para cada pessoa que usa seu aplicativo. Anvil é uma ferramenta de desenvolvedor. Os aplicativos que você desenvolve são seus. Permitir que você os execute em um Raspberry Pi é legal, mas não muda nosso modelo de negócios.<br/><br/>Estamos fazendo o que sempre fomos: Fazemos e vendemos uma ferramenta de desenvolvimento que torna drasticamente mais fácil criar aplicativos web. Nós fornecemos hospedagem para aplicativos Anvil. Oferecemos toda a plataforma de desenvolvimento e hospedagem no local para clientes corporativos. E, claro, oferecemos um plano gratuito para que todos possam usar o Anvil para fins de hobby ou educacionais - ou para começar a construir algo e ver como vai.<br/><br/>Nós open-sourced o Anvil App Server para o (relativamente pequeno) número de pessoas que precisam dele, e para fornecer a apólice de seguro final. Claro, você pode criar um aplicativo com o vim e hospedá-lo você mesmo, sem sequer registrar uma conta conosco (temos documentos para mostrar como!). Mas o Anvil Editor é a maneira mais fácil do mundo de construir um aplicativo web, e nosso serviço hospedado é a maneira mais fácil de implantá-lo – então é o que esperamos que a maioria de nossos usuários continue fazendo. E você pode construir com confiança, sabendo que o código de código aberto está lá, se você precisar.<br/><br/>Experimente você mesmo<br/><br/>Se a nossa filosofia de desenvolvimento ressoa com você, por que não tentar Anvil você mesmo? |
