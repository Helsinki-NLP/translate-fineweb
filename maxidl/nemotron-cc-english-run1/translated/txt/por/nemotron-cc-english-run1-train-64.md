| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - Através da Bíblia C2000 SeriesDevemos nos voltar para o livro de Atos, capítulo um, enquanto começamos nosso estudo da igreja primitiva.<br/>Lucas, o autor do livro de Atos, um companheiro de Paulo, o apóstolo, que também foi autor do Evangelho De acordo com Lucas, escreveu estes dois tratados para um amigo, Teófilo. Teófilo é um nome grego. É um nome que tem um significado bonito. O nome significa amante de Deus. Há alguns que acreditam que não era de todo um homem, mas que o evangelho e o livro de Atos foram endereçados aos que amam a Deus, quem quer que vocês sejam. Há outras tradições que dizem que Teófilo era realmente o mestre de Lucas. Que naqueles dias os médicos eram escravos, geralmente o escravo de um mecenas rico. Então, o mestre de Lucas era Teófilo, e ele soltou Lucas para estar com Paulo nas viagens missionárias. Assim, Lucas está escrevendo de volta ao seu antigo mestre. Esta é uma tradição primitiva da igreja, mas é, é claro, impossível de provar, como muitas das tradições.<br/>Há também aqueles que acreditam que quando Paulo estava em Trôade e ele recebeu uma visão de um homem chamando-o, dizendo: "Vem para a Macedônia e ajuda-nos", que esse homem na visão de Paulo não era outro senão Lucas. Porque o primeiro que Paulo realmente encontrou quando chegou à Macedônia foi Lucas. E como estamos no livro de Atos, você encontrará que quando chegamos a essa parte do livro de Atos, Lucas começa a escrever mais na primeira pessoa do que na terceira pessoa. Assim, é, evidentemente, neste ponto particular nos Atos dos Apóstolos que Lucas se tornou um companheiro de Paulo e começou a viajar com ele. Ele começou a usar os pronomes "nós" e "nos" em vez de "eles" e "eles". Este é, sem dúvida, onde Lucas se tornou um participante e uma testemunha ocular dessas coisas que estavam acontecendo a partir deste ponto em diante. Vamos trazer isso para você quando chegarmos a esse ponto.<br/>Ele começa os Atos dos Apóstolos, ligando-o com o Evangelho de acordo com Lucas. É interessante que a última coisa que Lucas registra em seu evangelho é a primeira coisa que ele registra nos Atos dos Apóstolos. Encontramos o evangelho de Lucas fechando como Jesus está dizendo aos Seus discípulos que esperem em Jerusalém até que sejam investidos de poder do alto. E então Jesus subiu ao céu, e assim ele fecha o evangelho. Ao abrir os Atos dos Apóstolos, ele escreve,<br/>O primeiro tratado [isto é, o Evangelho de acordo com Lucas,] eu escrevi a você, Teófilo, de tudo o que Jesus começou a fazer e ensinar (Atos 1:1),<br/>A palavra-chave é começada. O Evangelho de acordo com Lucas não é a história completa do ministério de Jesus Cristo. É apenas o início do ministério de Jesus Cristo. Jesus continua a ministrar às necessidades das pessoas. Jesus continua a curar os doentes. Jesus continua a ministrar Seu amor e Seu evangelho ao mundo, somente agora Ele está ministrando através daqueles discípulos que foram ungidos com Seu Espírito Santo. Mas o ministério de Cristo continua; basicamente, é a premissa que Lucas leva nos Atos dos Apóstolos. O primeiro tratado de tudo o que Jesus começou, tanto para fazer e para ensinar.<br/>Agora, por causa disso, os Atos dos Apóstolos são um livro inacabado: em que o Senhor hoje continua a trabalhar através da vida daqueles que se dedicaram a ser os instrumentos de Deus. Ser guiado e ungido pelo Seu Espírito Santo, continuar o ministério de Jesus no mundo de hoje. Agora Deus ordenou que Sua obra seja realizada através de instrumentos humanos. Eu não digo que ela deva ser realizada. Deus pode usar seres angélicos para Sua obra, e chegará um tempo, durante o livro de Apocalipse, em que Deus usará anjos para proclamar Seu evangelho a pessoas em todo o mundo. Apocalipse, capítulo 14, "O primeiro anjo voando pelo meio do céu, tendo o evangelho eterno" ( Ap 14:6 ). Mas no momento presente, Deus escolheu usar instrumentos humanos. Por mais imperfeitos que possam ser, ainda assim é isso que Deus ordenou para usar. A coisa emocionante sobre isso é, Deus vai me usar e Deus vai usar você. Muitas vezes, estamos implorando, "Ó Senhor, eu não posso falar. Eu nunca fui capaz de falar antes ou mesmo agora, Senhor." Como Moisés tentou implorar fora do chamado de Deus. Jeremiah disse: "Senhor, eu sou apenas uma criança; ninguém vai me ouvir." E todos nós temos nossas desculpas por que não podemos ser usados. Não sabemos? Todos nós sabemos as razões pelas quais Deus não poderia nos usar.<br/>Certa vez, quando o Senhor estava chamando um profeta para fazer a Sua obra, ele disse: "Senhor, envia quem quiseres." O Senhor disse: "Ei, eu te chamei." "Senhor, boa ideia; envia quem quiseres." Muitas vezes estamos nessa posição: "Senhor, envia pela mão de quem quiseres, qualquer um menos eu, Senhor." E ainda assim, Deus ordenou que nos usemos.<br/>Agora, cada um de nós pode mostrar nossas próprias imperfeições. Cada um de nós pode apontar nossas próprias incapacidades, e todos nós podemos encontrar uma desculpa por que Deus não quer me usar. Mas, no entanto, Deus escolheu usar você. Você se pergunta quando Deus tem tais instrumentos para usar como Ele fez o trabalho, não é mesmo?<br/>até o dia em que foi levado para cima, depois de haver dado mandamentos, pelo Espírito Santo, aos apóstolos que escolhera (Atos 1:2):<br/>É com isso que ele concluiu o Evangelho de Lucas. O dia em que Jesus foi levado, depois que Ele disse aos apóstolos que esperassem a investidura de poder.<br/>aos quais também, depois de haver padecido, se apresentou vivo, mediante muitas e infalíveis provas (Atos 1:3).<br/>É difícil negar o fato da ressurreição de Jesus Cristo. Fiquei entretido, bem como irritado e irritado, por um artigo que li no Santa Ana Register no último sábado. Da ciência da criação e das teorias evolutivas sendo apresentadas nas escolas do condado. Como isso, este professor disse que ele ensina uma classe de ciências, e assim, eles lidam apenas com fatos, e que eles não têm lugar para teorias. Porque a ciência é baseada em fatos e a criação é baseada em superstições religiosas. É preciso muita fé para acreditar nas teorias religiosas. Quando você está lidando com fatos, você pode simplesmente aceitá-los. Eu pensei: "Muito interessante nessa aula de ciências, eles me ensinaram que era um fato que o mundo tinha quatro bilhões de anos. Agora eles estão ensinando que é um fato que o mundo tem doze bilhões de anos. E não foi há muito tempo que eu fui para a escola."<br/>É interessante que a Bíblia nunca precisou ser revisada ou atualizada para atender aos dados atuais que os homens descobriram. E, no entanto, se você pegar meus livros didáticos de ciência do ensino médio hoje e tentar ensinar uma aula de ciência com eles, você descobriria que muitas das coisas que foram ensinadas como fato científico quando eu estava no ensino médio não são mais reconhecidas como fato científico. O protoplasma celular simples não é mais uma célula simples, mas extremamente complexa. Se há algum fato que pode ser atestado na história é o fato da ressurreição de Jesus Cristo dentre os mortos.<br/>Temos um sistema de jurisprudência que se baseia no testemunho de testemunhas. Se um homem é acusado de um crime e há pessoas que testemunharam esse crime enquanto ele estava sendo cometido, e eles são levados ao padrão, e eles juram dizer a verdade, toda a verdade, e nada além da verdade, então ajude-os Deus. E em seu interrogatório eles afirmam que: "Eu vi aquele homem no banco no dia 23 de maio. Eu o vi puxar uma arma de seu casaco. Eu ouvi-o exigir que todo o dinheiro fosse dado a ele. Eu o vi quando ele saiu do banco. Eu o vi como o oficial o prendeu do lado de fora." E se você pode obter três ou quatro testemunhas para apontar para esse homem e guardar o seu testemunho sob interrogatório, esse homem é considerado culpado. Ele é quem fez isso. Temos duas ou três testemunhas que estão testemunhando a mesma história sobre esse homem, e é aceito como fato que ele é quem cometeu o crime e é culpado. Você tem testemunhas que juraram dizer a verdade que estão verificando.<br/>Depois da morte de Jesus, quando Ele ressuscitou, Ele apareceu a muitas pessoas diferentes que juraram testemunhar que eles O viram. Que eles falaram com Ele, que Ele apareceu a eles em vários lugares em diferentes circunstâncias. E por um período de quarenta dias estava visitando com eles. E ao mesmo tempo, até quinhentas pessoas que estavam reunidas em um só lugar, Ele apareceu. É difícil simplesmente descartar ou negar o testemunho dessas pessoas. Fazer isso é desacreditar todo o nosso sistema jurisprudencial. Mas não só isso, esses homens que testemunharam que viram o Senhor ressuscitado, que falaram com Ele, que comeram com Ele, todos eles, com exceção de um, enfrentaram mortes violentas nas mãos de outras pessoas por causa de sua afirmação de que a história que contaram era verdadeira. Você fala sobre testemunhas que juraram dizer a verdade, toda a verdade, nada além da verdade. Se a vida de uma pessoa fosse ameaçada por causa dessa testemunha, e fosse uma mentira, pelo menos uma delas teria quebrado sob a pressão. Eles teriam confessado toda a farsa. "Ele se mostrou vivo depois de sua paixão por muitas provas infalíveis."<br/>sendo visto por eles por quarenta dias, falando-lhes das coisas referentes ao reino de Deus (Atos 1:3):<br/>Às vezes nós culpamos os discípulos por causa de suas perguntas sobre o tempo do reino de Deus. Que seja lembrado que o reino de Deus era o assunto favorito de Jesus Cristo. Ele estava sempre falando sobre o reino de Deus, e é uma grande esperança que Ele estava plantando nos corações de todos os homens. As coisas nem sempre vão continuar corrompidas como são. O mundo não vai ficar para sempre sob o poder das trevas, sob a escravidão do mal. Deus vai um dia estabelecer o Seu reino sobre a terra. Um reino de alegria e paz justas. "Jesus reinará onde o sol fizer suas sucessivas jornadas, e seu reino se estenderá de costa a costa." E aquele dia será o dia mais glorioso que o mundo já viu, quando a doença, o sofrimento e a dor serão abolidos em Seu reino. Como o pecado e a ganância e essas coisas que fizeram do mundo um lugar tão intolerável serão abolidos em Seu reino. O mercantilismo ímpio, a exploração do homem, todas essas coisas foram abolidas em Seu glorioso reino quando Ele reina. Não é de admirar que os discípulos estivessem ansiosos para obtê-lo. Estou ansioso para obtê-lo; Estou ansioso para que Seu reino venha. E Jesus nos disse quando oramos, a primeira petição é: "Venha o teu reino. Seja feita a tua vontade, assim na terra como no céu" ( Mateus 6:10 ). Este é o tipo certo de desejo que todos nós devemos ter. Eu desejo o reino de Deus. E assim Ele estava falando com eles, durante este período de quarenta dias, do Reino.<br/>E, estando com eles, ordenou-lhes que não se ausentassem de Jerusalém, mas que esperassem a promessa do Pai, a qual, disse ele, ouvistes de mim.<br/>Ele disse: “Agora, olha, espera aqui em Jerusalém até que recebas a promessa do Pai”. Esta promessa a que Ele se refere é, sem dúvida, a promessa em Joel, onde o Senhor prometeu: "E acontecerá nos últimos dias, diz o Senhor, que derramarei o meu Espírito sobre toda a carne; e vossos filhos e vossas filhas profetizarão, e vossos mancebos terão sonhos, vossos anciãos terão visões; e sobre os meus servos e as minhas servas derramarei o meu Espírito, diz o Senhor". A promessa do Pai: o dia virá em que Deus derramará Seu Espírito sobre toda a carne, sobre todos os crentes. Eles receberão, cada um, essa dinâmica de Deus.<br/>“Porque João, na verdade, batizou com água; mas vós sereis batizados com o Espírito Santo, não muito depois destes dias” (Atos 1:5).<br/>A idéia do batismo era a de emersão, o bapteedzo. João batizou com água, submergiu o povo na água, "você vai ser submerso no Espírito Santo em não muitos dias."<br/>Quando, pois, se ajuntaram, perguntaram-lhe, dizendo: Senhor, restaurarás neste tempo o reino a Israel?<br/>"Quando será, Senhor? Quando é o tempo para esta restauração?" E Jesus está falando com eles agora, não sobre o reino, mas sobre o poder que eles receberão para o serviço. E assim Ele deixa de lado a pergunta deles.<br/>Respondendo-lhes, disse: Não vos compete a vós saber os tempos ou as estações que o Pai estabeleceu no seu próprio poder (Atos 1:7).<br/>"Não é para você saber." Eles viviam constantemente na expectativa do estabelecimento imediato do reino. Durante toda a vida de Jesus, eles estavam esperando por Ele a qualquer momento para entrar na cabine telefônica e sair como o salvador do mundo. Shazzam! Mostrando Seu poder e derrubando os governos do mundo, estabelecendo o reino de Deus sobre a terra. E eles estavam esperando diariamente que essa mudança acontecesse. E todas as vezes que Jesus falava sobre ir a Jerusalém, ser entregue nas mãos de um homem pecador, e então ser crucificado, "Oh, oh não, Senhor. Não, não, tu não compreendes o reino, Senhor. Estai tão longe de Ti." Quando Jesus morreu na cruz, todos ficaram muito desapontados.<br/>Os dois discípulos no caminho para Emaús, tão triste. "Ei, companheiros. Por que vocês estão tão tristes quanto sua caminhada?" "O que você quer dizer? Você deve ser um estranho por aqui se você não sabe as coisas que têm acontecido ultimamente em Jerusalém." "Que coisas?" "Oh, um homem chamado Jesus de Nazaré...oh homem, era poderoso e poderoso. A unção de Deus estava sobre Sua vida. Nós esperávamos que nele estivesse a libertação de Israel, mas eles O crucificaram. Nós esperávamos . . . agora está morto." Agora Ele ressuscitou, e Ele está dizendo: "Em poucos dias, companheiros, vocês vão receber a promessa do Pai." "Oh, que promessa? A promessa do estabelecimento do reino?" Você vê, era legítimo que eles deveriam perguntar. "É isto Senhor? Tudo bem! É este o tempo? Você vai estabelecer o seu reino agora? "Não. Não é para você saber os tempos que o Pai designou ou que o Pai tem em seu próprio poder. Mas você receberá poder quando o Espírito Santo descer sobre você."<br/>Agora aqui, a preposição grega epi é usada para significar um novo relacionamento que eles deveriam ter com o Espírito Santo. No Evangelho De acordo com João, capítulo 14, como Jesus está lá prometendo enviar o Espírito Santo, Ele disse: "Não vos deixarei desconfortáveis. Eu virei a vós, e rogarei ao Pai, e ele vos enviará outro consolador, o Espírito da verdade, que o mundo não pode receber, porque não O vê nem O conhece; mas vós O conheceis, porque habita convosco, e Ele estará em vós” (Jo 14:17-18). A mesma preposição grega como a nossa, apenas eles soletram "en" em vez de "em". Relação dupla lá em João: Ele está com você, mas Ele vai morar em você. Mas agora Jesus disse que você vai receber poder quando o Espírito Santo vier sobre você. A preposição grega epi, que é traduzida em diferentes textos ao longo do Novo Testamento como "upon" ou "over" ou eu gosto disso, "transborda".<br/>No sétimo capítulo do evangelho de João: “No último dia, o grande dia da festa, quando Jesus estava ali no Monte do Templo e clamou ao povo: ‘Se alguém tiver sede, venha a mim e beba; e quem beber da água que eu dou, do seu íntimo brotarão torrentes de água viva’”. João disse: "Este falou do Espírito, que ainda não foi dado, para que os que nele crêem recebam" (João 7:37-39). O que ele disse do Espírito? Que seria como um riacho de água viva que corre. Eu gosto, "Quando o Espírito transborda em você", sobre você, ou sobre você, ou transborda de você. Então, a relação tríplice: Ele está com você antes de sua conversão, Ele é aquele que faz com que você perceba que você é um pecador, Ele é aquele que aponta para Jesus Cristo como a resposta enquanto convence o mundo do pecado, do justo e do julgamento. No momento em que você abre sua vida e seu coração a Jesus Cristo e o convida a entrar, o Espírito Santo vem e começa a habitar em você. Ele estará em você. "Não sabeis vós que fostes comprados por preço? glorificai, pois, a Deus no vosso corpo e no vosso espírito, os quais são dele; e que o vosso corpo é do Espírito Santo, que está em vós? Não vos embriagueis com vinho, em que há excesso, mas enchei-vos, ou vos encheis do Espírito" (1Co 6:19-20, Ef 5:18). Mas agora há uma terceira relação. Esta é uma experiência fortalecedora.<br/>Vocês receberão a dinâmica, quando o Espírito Santo vier sobre vocês [ou sobre vocês, ou quando houver um transbordamento de vocês]; e vocês serão testemunhas de mim ( Atos 1:8 ).<br/>E assim a dinâmica, para ser uma testemunha de Jesus Cristo. É interessante que a palavra testemunha em grego é a palavra martus de onde obtemos a nossa palavra mártir. E em grego significa mártir. Uma testemunha é alguém que não só proclama o que acredita, ele vive o que acredita, ele é o que ele acredita, e ele acredita tão fortemente que, se necessário, ele morrerá pelo que ele acredita. Ele não tem medo de morrer pelo que acredita.<br/>Você se lembra quando Paulo estava voltando para Jerusalém e Ágabo desceu de Cesaréia e ele pegou o cinto de Paulo e amarrou-se e disse: "Assim é o homem que possui este cinto para ser amarrado quando ele chegar a Jerusalém." E os amigos de Paulo começaram a chorar, dizendo: "Oh, Paulo, não vás, não vás." E ele disse: "O que você quer dizer com essas lágrimas? Você acha que você vai me dissuadir? Você acha que eu estou preocupado com ser amarrado? Estou pronto para morrer." Ele era um martus. "Estou pronto para morrer." Ser morto por sua fé não fez de você um mártir; porque você era um mártir, você foi morto. Porque você foi uma testemunha, porque você acreditou tão forte. Então, isso não fez de você uma testemunha, só provou o que você era. Você foi uma testemunha o tempo todo. Se você não tivesse sido um Martus, você nunca teria ido até a sua morte. Você teria se retratado; você teria dito: "Uau, uau, espere, espere. Espere, vamos mudar de rumo aqui. Eu acho que eu posso ter cometido um erro." Então você diz: "Bem, ele não era um Martus. Roubar um cavalo não faz de você um ladrão de cavalos; isso só prova que você era. Ninguém rouba um cavalo a menos que ele seja um ladrão de cavalos. Então, roubá-lo não faz de você um ladrão de cavalos, só prova que você foi todo o tempo. Ser martirizado só prova o que você foi uma testemunha, um martus. "E você será testemunha." E não é interessante que a maioria deles foram martirizados? "Testemunhas para Mim."<br/>O testemunho era para ser tanto em Jerusalém, e em toda a Judéia (Atos 1:8),<br/>A testemunha começou bem em casa. O lugar mais difícil, não é? É começar bem em casa em Jerusalém, e depois a área em torno de Jerusalém, a área da Judéia. E então foi para se espalhar para Samaria. E então foi para ir para as partes mais distantes do mundo. E enquanto estudamos o livro de Atos, veremos essa mesma progressão. Como a testemunha começou em Jerusalém. Vamos ver isso no próximo capítulo. E então veremos como começou a se espalhar por toda a Judéia. E então Filipe subiu a Samaria, e então, finalmente, Paulo e Barnabé são chamados para ir para as partes mais distantes do mundo. E assim o testemunho se espalhou através da unção e do fortalecimento do Espírito Santo.<br/>Tendo ele dito estas coisas, enquanto eles as viam, foi levado para cima, e uma nuvem o recebeu, ocultando-o a seus olhos (Atos 1:9).<br/>Esta é a promessa final feita por Jesus aos Seus discípulos. Esta é a palavra final antes de Sua ascensão. Claro, mais tarde Ele veio e falou com Paulo e outros, mas antes de Sua ascensão, esta é Sua palavra final. Tendo ele dito estas coisas, enquanto eles o observavam, foi levado para cima, e uma nuvem o recebeu, ocultando-o a seus olhos.<br/>E, estando eles com os olhos fitos no céu, enquanto Jesus subia, eis que junto deles se puseram dois homens vestidos de branco;<br/>Assumimos que eram anjos.<br/>O qual também disse: Varões galileus, por que estais olhando para o céu? Este mesmo Jesus, que dentre vós foi elevado para o céu, há de vir assim como o vistes ir para o céu (Atos 1:11).<br/>Eles O viram quando Ele subiu ao céu e o verão quando Ele voltar. "Eis que o Senhor vem com dez mil de seus santos, para executar juízo sobre a terra" (Judas 1:14-15). E então, "Aquele que nos amou e se entregou por nós e nos fez nosso Deus, reis e sacerdotes que reinarão com ele na terra, eis que vem o Senhor, e todos os olhos O verão, e também os que O traspassaram prantearão" Apocalipse 1:5-7). Então o Senhor vem. Todo olho O verá. As Testemunhas de Jeová dizem que Ele já veio, mas foi uma vinda secreta. Como foram apenas os discípulos que O viram partir, foram apenas os discípulos, das Testemunhas de Jeová, que O viram retornar. Mas Jesus disse: "Se eles vos disserem: 'Ele veio em segredo e entrou em uma câmara secreta, não acreditem'" ( Mateus 24:26 ). Então você tem que escolher, para acreditar em Jesus ou eles.<br/>“Este mesmo Jesus, que foi levado de vós para o céu, assim virá da mesma maneira como o vistes ir para o céu.”<br/>Agora, há um versículo muito interessante em II João, versículo Atos 1:7, "Porque muitos enganadores entraram no mundo, os quais não confessam que Jesus Cristo veio em carne." Isso, infelizmente, é uma tradução pobre do grego. Para este particípio está no tempo presente e deve ser traduzido "está vindo na carne." Aqueles que negam que Jesus Cristo está vindo na carne. O que João diz deles? "Eles são um enganador e um anticristo. Olhai por vós mesmos, para que não percamos o que temos ganhado; antes, recebamos o galardão completo, porque todo aquele que não pratica a doutrina de Cristo não é de Deus. Aquele que permanece na doutrina de Cristo, ele tem tanto o Pai como o Filho. E se alguém vem à sua porta (no sábado de manhã) e não traz esta doutrina, não o recebam em sua casa, nem lhe dêem adeus. Porque aquele que se despede dele é participante das suas más obras" (2Jo 1:7-11). Faça-lhes uma pergunta: "Jesus vem na carne?" Basta perguntar-lhes essa pergunta. E se eles dizem não, lembre-se apenas do que João avisou a você e do que João disse a você. "Se alguém não confessar que Jesus Cristo está vindo em carne." Você se lembra quando Ele estava com os discípulos e Ele disse: "Dê-me algo para comer"? Ele disse: "Você sabe, os espíritos não comem; tocar-me. Veja? Sou eu." Então, este mesmo Jesus está voltando da mesma maneira que o viram ir para o céu. E eu, por um lado, acredito que essa vinda é muito em breve.<br/>Então voltaram para Jerusalém, vindo do monte chamado das Oliveiras, que está perto de Jerusalém, a uma distância de um dia de sábado. E, entrando, subiram ao cenáculo, onde habitavam Pedro e Tiago, João e André, Filipe e Tomé, Bartolomeu e Mateus; Tiago, filho de Alfeu, Simão, o Zelote, e Judas, irmão de Tiago. E todos estes perseveravam unanimemente em oração e súplicas, com as mulheres, e Maria, mãe de Jesus, e com seus irmãos (Atos 1:12-14).<br/>Esta é a última menção de Maria, a mãe de Jesus. Neste ponto e a partir deste ponto, não há mais menção dela nos Atos dos Apóstolos ou nas epístolas. Nenhuma menção de sua morte ou de sua ascensão milagrosa ao céu, sem morte. Nada é mencionado nas escrituras. É silencioso.<br/>Seus irmãos seriam provavelmente uma referência a Tiago e a Judas e aos outros irmãos que eram filhos de José e Maria.<br/>O quarto de cima – há alguns que dizem que é o mesmo quarto de cima em que Jesus teve a Última Ceia com os Seus discípulos. E, no entanto, há outros que se apegam a este quarto de cima sendo um quarto no recinto do templo onde a igreja primitiva se reuniu. Faça a sua escolha.<br/>E naqueles dias levantou-se Pedro no meio dos discípulos, e disse: Varões irmãos, pelo número de seus nomes, uns cento e vinte, é necessário que se cumprisse esta Escritura, que o Espírito Santo predisse pela boca de Davi, acerca de Judas, que foi o guia daqueles que tomaram a Jesus (Atos 1:15-16).<br/>Aqui, novamente, Pedro ainda é o mesmo eu impetuoso. Eles estão esperando em oração e súplica, e Pedro se levanta e diz: "Companheiros, há uma escritura que tem que ser cumprida." E vocês sabem que ele vai seguir em frente: “Vamos fazer o programa funcionar; vamos jogar sorteios e descobrir quem vai tomar o lugar de Judas.” Eu sinto que Pedro estava novamente na carne, manifestando essa natureza impetuosa que era dele. E eu acho que a história futura da igreja no livro de Atos aponta isso. Estou interessado na compreensão de Pedro das escrituras, como ele está citando de tantos lugares no Antigo Testamento. Pedro manifesta uma compreensão muito grande das escrituras do Antigo Testamento que é um ponto a seu favor.<br/>Note que Pedro atribui ao Espírito Santo as coisas que Davi escreveu. De modo que, "Toda a Escritura é inspirada por Deus" (2Tm 3:16). Não faz parte das escrituras. Porque, se você me disser que parte das escrituras são dadas por inspiração de Deus, então eu devo perguntar: "Que partes são por inspiração e quais partes não são por inspiração?" E então você é a autoridade que me diz em que parte eu posso acreditar e em que parte eu não posso acreditar. E o minuto que Deus não é mais a autoridade, mas você é a autoridade, eu estou em apuros. Cuidado com aqueles que dizem: "Bem, você não pode acreditar em todas as escrituras." As próprias escrituras dizem: "Toda a Escritura é inspirada por Deus." E aqui, Lucas por escrito do que Pedro estava dizendo, declara que Davi era realmente o porta-voz do Espírito Santo. O Espírito Santo, pela boca de Davi, falou a respeito de Judas.<br/>Porque foi contado entre nós, e alcançou parte deste ministério; mas agora comprou um campo com o galardão da iniqüidade, e caiu em desgraça (Atos 1:17-18),<br/>Ele comprou o campo, o campo do oleiro, como Zacarias declara no capítulo 11.<br/>e caindo de cabeça para baixo, ele explodiu no meio, e todas as suas entranhas jorraram (Atos 1:18).<br/>Há aqueles que acham uma discrepância nas escrituras, porque em um dos evangelhos nos é dito que quando Judas voltou e tentou devolver o dinheiro, e eles disseram: "Ei, é seu problema. Nós não podemos levá-lo." E colocá-lo de volta no tesouro do templo. "É dinheiro de sangue." Então ele o jogou lá no chão do templo e ele saiu e se enforcou. Aqui Pedro nos diz que ele caiu de cabeça e acabou de estalar. E há aqueles que imaginam uma discrepância. Muito simples, ele subiu na árvore para se enforcar, amarrou a corda ao pescoço e amarrou-a ao membro e pulou. E a força da queda quebrou a corda ou a cabeça, e ele caiu no desfiladeiro e assim como ele disse aqui.<br/>E era conhecido de todos os habitantes de Jerusalém, de tal maneira que na sua própria língua esse campo se chama Aceldama, isto é, Campo de Sangue. Porque está escrito no livro dos Salmos: Que a sua habitação seja desolada, e que ninguém nela habite; e: Que o seu bispado tome outro (Atos 1:19-20).<br/>Agora, na realidade, ele está citando dois Salmos diferentes aqui. De Sl 69:25 , ele coloca isso junto com Sl 109:8 . E colocando os dois juntos, ele encontra essas profecias sobre Judas.<br/>Por isso, entre esses homens (Atos 1:21).<br/>Agora aqui é onde eles estão procurando alguém para tomar o lugar de Judas para ser um apóstolo. Aqui estão as qualificações que eles procuravam naquele tempo.<br/>Por isso, entre esses homens que têm estado conosco todo o tempo que o Senhor Jesus está dentro e fora entre nós (Atos 1:21),<br/>Agora você se lembra que havia muitos discípulos, muitos discípulos dos quais Jesus escolheu dez para serem apóstolos. E a palavra apóstolo significa "um que é enviado". Ou escolheu doze para serem apóstolos, então Ele enviou os doze. O número de governo humano. "Nós só temos onze. Precisamos de um para tomar o lugar de Judas, mas precisamos de alguém que tenha estado conosco todo o tempo desde o início com Jesus."<br/>Desde o tempo em que ele foi batizado por João, até o dia em que foi levado de nós, alguém deve ser ordenado para ser testemunha [de quê?] de sua ressurreição (Atos 1:22).<br/>Então, estas eram as exigências que eles estavam procurando. Alguém que tinha sido ao redor durante todo o tempo. Desde o tempo do batismo de João para a ascensão. E aquele que viu o Senhor ressuscitado, e assim poderia suportar o fato da ressurreição, o seu testemunho para o fato.<br/>Agora, o apóstolo Paulo, mais tarde em afirmar o fato de que ele era um apóstolo disse: "Eu não vi o Cristo ressuscitado?" Evidentemente que era um dos requisitos do apostolado. Alguém me perguntou: "Existem apóstolos hoje?" Bem, eu não sei. Eu não acho que existem no mesmo sentido que eles estavam no Novo Testamento. Certamente não há hoje ninguém que possa dar testemunho da ressurreição como eles fizeram.<br/>E designaram dois: José, chamado Barsabás, que tinha por sobrenome o Justo, e Matias, e oraram, dizendo: Senhor, conhece os corações de todos; mostra-nos qual destes dois tens escolhido (Atos 1:23-24),<br/>Eu acho que muitas vezes cometemos esse erro de dar ao Senhor duas escolhas, ambas erradas. Limitando Deus, você vê. Estamos tão propensos a fazer isso. Obviamente, Paulo foi a escolha de Deus. Peter foi impetuoso, e pulando a arma disse: "Ei, nós temos que fazer algo, você sabe, temos que ajudar Deus. Você sabe, um está faltando e nós temos que preenchê-lo." E ainda, "Deus, qual desses dois você quer?" E dando a Deus as duas escolhas.<br/>Para que ele possa tomar parte neste ministério e este apostolado, do qual Judas pela transgressão caiu, para que ele pudesse ir para o seu próprio lugar. E assim eles deram a sua sorte ( Atos 1:25-26 );<br/>Uma maneira interessante pela qual eles procuraram determinar a vontade de Deus. Vamos jogar dados, descobrir qual é a vontade de Deus aqui. É interessante para mim, as várias maneiras que as pessoas têm concebido para discernir a vontade de Deus. Agora, nos tempos do Antigo Testamento, eles tinham uma maneira interessante de vir ao sacerdote, que perguntaria ao Senhor por eles através do Urim e do Tumim, as "luzes e perfeições". Exatamente o que esses Urim e Tumim eram, nós não sabemos. Tenho certeza de que eles não eram os óculos coloridos que Joseph Smith encontrou com as Tábuas de Ouro; os óculos mágicos, que quando você os coloca, você pode de repente ler a escrita hieroglífica.<br/>Há aqueles que dizem que o Urim e Tumim eram na verdade uma pedra preta e branca que era usada em uma bolsa no peito do sacerdote. Eles oravam e faziam uma pergunta particular ao Senhor. Lembras-te de que Davi perguntava ao Senhor: Senhor, sairemos contra os filisteus? Respondeu-lhe: Não. Então, no dia seguinte, disse: Senhor, sairemos contra os filisteus? Respondeu-lhe: Sim. Quando iremos? Eles faziam perguntas específicas, e o Senhor os direcionava através do Urim e do Thummin. Eles dizem que o sacerdote orava, buscava a Deus, e então chegava e puxava uma das duas pedras. Se fosse a pedra branca, era uma resposta sim. Se fosse um não, então seria a pedra preta que ele retiraria. Alguns até dizem que obtemos o termo blackballed deste Urim e Tumim. Na verdade, de volta ao original é um não voto contra um projeto ou ideia em particular. Exatamente o que os Urim e Tumim eram, não sabemos. Mas durante o período do Antigo Testamento, eles usaram um método de sorteio para determinar a vontade de Deus.<br/>Então, aqui os discípulos estão pegando na mesma coisa que eles estão jogando os dados para ver qual dos dois companheiros que Deus havia escolhido para substituir Judas Iscariotes.<br/>a sorte caiu sobre Matias; ele foi contado com os onze (Atos 1:26).<br/>Agora, quem no mundo é Matias? Ninguém nunca ouviu falar dele antes ou depois. Será interessante conhecer Matias e descobrir quem ele é e o que ele fez. Eu acho que a partir da história subsequente, é óbvio assumir que Deus escolheu Paulo como apóstolo. Paulo mesmo declara. Agora esta é a última vez que lemos sobre eles que procuram discernir a vontade de Deus pelo sorteio ou por uma espécie de acaso de uma coisa.<br/>Conheço um homem que hoje, ao procurar discernir a vontade do Senhor, orará e fará uma pergunta ao Senhor. Ele terá dez centavos em seu bolso, e enquanto ele está orando, ele vai pegar os centavos com os olhos fechados e colocá-los na mesa, e se todos eles vêm cabeças, é um sim. Uma coisa interessante, de vez em quando, todos eles vêm à tona, e isso é muito bom. No entanto, não encontramos nenhum padrão para isso depois que o Espírito Santo foi dado. Quando o Espírito Santo desceu sobre a igreja, começou a falar-lhes, dirigindo-lhes as palavras: "Separai-me a Paulo e Barnabé para o ministério a que os tenho chamado" (Atos 13:2). E o Espírito Santo os enviou. Então encontramos a igreja mais diretamente guiada pelo Espírito Santo. Uma vez que o Espírito Santo veio, este lance de dados para descobrir a vontade de Deus foi deixado de lado.<br/>"<br/><br/>Versão King James<br/><br/>Esta é a Versão King James de 1769 da Bíblia Sagrada (também conhecida como a Versão Autorizada). |

Yes that is correct, the Urbanears don't have a built in noise cancelling mic on the headphone itself but from what I can see there is a mic on the cable provided.<br/>1.

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

Dentro de um driver dinâmico há um ímã, e quando você conecta os fones de ouvido, você está enviando uma corrente alternada através dele que transformará a bobina de voz em um ímã. Dependendo da direção da corrente, a polaridade do ímã mudará. Agora, como sabemos que um ímã, as mesmas cargas repelem e diferentes cargas se atraem, sabemos que a bobina de voz se moverá para frente e para trás, dependendo da polaridade no momento. A bobina de voz é anexada ao diafragma que irá então se mover para trás e para a frente criando uma onda sonora. O mesmo acontece ao contrário, se você mover uma bobina através de um ímã você produz uma corrente em vez disso.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

Isso amplia a prova de que os ideais bolcheviques que outrora haviam sido as raízes do Partido Comunista estavam sendo desarranjados e destruídos pelos Purgas.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell está nerfing lutadores em vez de nerfing poderes estrela. Eu estava em 750 na última temporada com poder 8 nita e é muito difícil passar que, como, poderes estrela desempenham um papel realmente dominante. O matchmaking também é lixo. Quando eu jogo gem grab (cerca de 600 troféus), muitas vezes há confrontos onde a equipe inimiga tem um jogador a mais do que nós que é maximizado e nem sequer é que temos um lvl 9 para competir contra isso. Às vezes, há até mesmo matchups onde a equipe inimiga está totalmente maximizada e nenhum de nós está. É por isso que eu não jogar estrelas briga a sério mais. Não é nem como não há muitos jogadores que não são maximizados e em torno de 600 troféus. É irritante.<br/>Edit: Eu acho que supercell deve ter pelo menos um mecanismo básico que leva a média de níveis de lutadores ao configurar partidas.<br/><br/>Exceto que os troféus realmente não indicam sua habilidade. Eles indicam a habilidade dos companheiros de equipe com quem você está colocado. E eu estou bem com jogar contra lutadores de nível superior, mas quando uma equipe é toda de nível 10 e a outra equipe não é, claramente é desequilibrado.<br/><br/>Eu recomendo conseguir alguns bons amigos para jogar com, eu e 2 amigos tenho meus amigos poder 1 tick para classificar 28 jogando gem grab com uma certa composição durante todo o dia e conseguimos sem um único de nós sendo maxed com os nossos lutadores.<br/><br/>Eu sei como você sente que eu costumava ter lutadores em troféus altos com baixo nível e é difícil ir mais longe e tudo o que eu estava dizendo para mim mesmo "Eu quero ter poderes de estrela" realmente supercell precisa para fazer o equilíbrio para os poderes de estrela ou pelo menos fazer um melhor sistema de matchmaking.<br/><br/>Eu meio que sinto isso. Eu não sou tão bom no jogo como você, mas eu tenho Emz para 500 no poder 1 e o matchmaking foi horrível. Maximized jogadores em todos os lugares! E não ajudou que a maioria dos meus companheiros de equipe tinha em torno de 5-8k troféus... Eu tive que recorrer ao confronto solo de última hora porque eu posso emboscar jogadores desavisados ou simplesmente jogar um pouco agressivo nos momentos certos. Mas eu realmente gostaria que fosse um pouco mais fácil para as pessoas que querem empurrar os lutadores para faixas de troféus muito altas sem ter o luxo de poderes de estrelas.<br/><br/>Altho spike ainda é bom sem curveball. Curveball foi apenas uma ajuda para acertar seus tiros mais frequentemente como spike. Mas mesmo antes de curveball foi lançado, spike era um lutador realmente forte, então ele permanecerá o mesmo agora.<br/><br/>Eu concordo que eles deveriam ter nerfed emboscada, mas eu acho que eles estão tentando equilibrar tanto Snappy Sniping e Emboscada, como ambos estão se fundindo com esta mudança. Ela estava se tornando um pouco poderoso, mas ainda não nerf-worthy<br/><br/>Eu não tenho certeza sobre isso, mas agora que Darryl tem um buff perceptível, olhando para suas novas estatísticas, parece que Darryl pode ofuscar Bull, como não só ele sempre pode causar mais danos do que Bull, ele não vai morrer tão cedo mais, então sua sobrevivência será semelhante sem poder de estrela (embora a capacidade de sobrevivência de Bull ainda é visivelmente melhor do que a de Darryl). Não só isso, super de Darryl pode auto regenerar, o que significa Darryl PODE ser capaz de ser jogado de forma eficaz tanto como um peso pesado e um assassino, ao mesmo tempo (antes que ele suga como um peso pesado, mas decente como um assassino)<br/><br/>Mas ele é superestimado af. E você recebe troféus com ele muito facilmente. Então, eu estou um pouco ok com o nerf. Eu nem sequer o toquei desde quando eu o levei para 500 (cerca de 5 meses atrás), então não me importo tanto.<br/><br/>Por que o Poco/Penny não tem um HP nerf, se eles são Marksman/Healer, respectivamente, não um tanque?<br/>Por que a tonicidade de Rosa não está nervosa, tosse 70% de redução de danos?<br/>Por que o Tick pode ter o alcance mais alto e o dano de poke mais livre em todo o jogo?<br/>Porque é que o Leon não tem um "HP/Damage Buff"?<br/><br/>Seja como for, foi Ambush que foi OP, não base Piper. Eu argumentaria que Ambush é o melhor poder de estrela no jogo (agora ainda mais, uma vez que a porcentagem de aumento de danos subiu indiretamente) e base Piper era um lutador de bottom-10.<br/><br/>O que Supercell deve fazer é reverter ambos os nerfs, reduzir Emboscada para 600 e reduzir Snappy Sniping para 0.25, já que seria indiretamente aprimorado pelo buff de dano base.<br/><br/>Sim e eu acredito que eles foram um pouco longe demais com Rosa, porque agora ela é basicamente o melhor touro agora quando se trata de tanques, que ela tem sido por um tempo. Agora, Darryl poderia muito bem ser um touro menor, mais poderoso<br/><br/>Por quê? Eu sinto que ela precisa de um buff em quase tudo, exceto em seu poder de estrela. Sua saúde e velocidade a tornam um pouco mais difícil de usar, porque ela pode morrer com bastante facilidade, e é realmente difícil para ela prender lutadores mais rápidos como Crow. Seu poder de estrela está um pouco quebrado embora... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Auto-emprego Parte 1<br/><br/>Quando você aceita um emprego em qualquer organização, você tem que executar vários trabalhos de acordo com os requisitos do seu empregador e você pode obter um montante fixo de renda como salário. Você pode executar uma pequena loja de varejo, alfaiataria, restaurante, padaria e confeitaria, salão de beleza, etc. em sua localidade. Você pode se envolver em comércio ou fabricação em pequena escala ou fornecer algum serviço por um preço. Tais atividades econômicas são conhecidas como trabalho autônomo.<br/><br/>Significado de auto-emprego<br/><br/>Ganhar é necessário para viver. Nosso pai, mãe, irmãos, irmãs e outros podem estar envolvidos em diferentes atividades econômicas através das quais eles ganham seu sustento. Estas pessoas exercem uma actividade económica denominada «emprego assalariado» ou «emprego assalariado», mas há muitas pessoas que exercem uma actividade profissional ou uma empresa que iniciam e gerem por conta própria. Eles colocam seus melhores esforços e assumem todos os tipos de riscos para prosseguir suas carreiras com sucesso. Todo o lucro de seu trabalho vai para eles. Todos nós vimos pequenas mercearias, alfaiatas, lojas médicas etc. em nossa localidade. Estes são de propriedade e gerenciados por uma pessoa, com ou sem a ajuda de alguns assistentes. Suas atividades econômicas são denominadas como trabalho autônomo. Então, quando um indivíduo se envolve em qualquer atividade econômica e gerencia por conta própria, é conhecido como trabalho autônomo.<br/><br/>Objectivos<br/><br/>Depois de estudar esta lição, você será capaz de:<br/><br/>Imagem dos Objetivos<br/><br/>Imagem dos Objetivos<br/><br/>Características do trabalho por conta própria<br/><br/>Envolve a propriedade e a gestão das actividades por parte de uma pessoa, embora esta possa recorrer à ajuda de uma ou duas pessoas para o assistir. Assim, o trabalho por conta própria pode também proporcionar emprego a outras pessoas.<br/><br/>O ganho do trabalho autônomo não é fixo. Depende da renda que se pode ganhar produzindo ou comprando e vendendo bens ou fornecendo serviços a outros a um preço.<br/><br/>No trabalho autônomo, o proprietário tem que assumir sozinho o lucro e assumir o risco de perda. Assim, encontramos uma ligação direta entre o esforço e a recompensa no trabalho autônomo.<br/><br/>Requer algum investimento de capital, embora possa ser pequeno.<br/><br/>No trabalho autônomo, uma pessoa é livre para tomar decisões em relação à gestão de seus negócios de forma lucrativa e aproveitar qualquer oportunidade que possa surgir para a expansão de seus negócios. Dá total liberdade para trabalhar de acordo com a própria vontade e dentro dos parâmetros das leis vigentes.<br/><br/>Assim, o trabalho autônomo pode ser definido como uma atividade econômica que uma pessoa pode realizar por conta própria como uma ocupação lucrativa, e isso pode consistir em produzir e vender bens, comprar e vender bens ou prestar serviços por um preço. |
