| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Leclaire<br/><br/>O bairro histórico de Leclaire, uma vez referido como o "subúrbio ao sul" de Edwardsville, foi fundado como uma comunidade cooperativa em 1890 e permaneceu uma aldeia separada até ser anexada à cidade de Edwardsville em 1934. Jornais e revistas em todo os Estados Unidos e Europa relataram sobre o experimento de Leclaire, particularmente durante os primeiros 20 anos de sua existência. Em 1979, devido à sua história única, a antiga vila foi listada no Registro Nacional de Lugares Históricos.<br/><br/>Leclaire foi fundada por Nelson Oliver Nelson, um fabricante de encanamento de St. Louis que, por muitos anos, procurou avançar a situação da classe trabalhadora. Nelson queria melhorar as condições de trabalho de seus funcionários e fornecer moradia perto das fábricas para que os trabalhadores e suas famílias pudessem facilmente participar de programas recreativos e educacionais oferecidos gratuitamente pela empresa. Antes de 1890, enquanto ainda em St. Louis, os negócios de fabricação e distribuição da N. O. Nelson Company começaram a fornecer participação nos lucros, juntamente com oportunidades educacionais e recreativas. O experimento cooperativo de Leclaire traria benefícios adicionais.<br/><br/>Quando os funcionários de Nelson indicaram que queriam se mudar para um local rural, representantes da empresa se aproximaram de líderes de pequenas cidades em várias comunidades do Missouri e Illinois perto de sua sede em St. Louis. Eles estavam procurando uma propriedade adequada para construir novas fábricas e uma vila modelo. Ao sul de Edwardsville, eles encontraram uma área de 125 acres de terra com acesso a água, carvão e transporte. Os empresários locais agiram rapidamente para oferecer um incentivo financeiro. Em menos de três semanas, a comunidade levantou um fundo de US $ 20.000 de contribuições individuais de entre US $ 1 e US $ 1.000 para atrair Nelson para escolher Edwardsville para sua empresa.<br/><br/>Os líderes da cidade esperavam localizar propriedades dentro dos limites da cidade de Edwardsville, mas quando nenhum local adequado foi encontrado, eles estavam confiantes de que o investimento de Nelson ao sul da cidade logo se tornaria parte de Edwardsville. Embora Nelson cumprisse todas as contingências para a construção e criação de empregos em seu contrato, seriam 44 anos antes da anexação de Edwardsville. Leclaire, delimitada por Madison / Brown Avenues a leste, as trilhas ferroviárias a oeste, Hadley / McKinley Avenues no sul e Wolf Street ao norte, permaneceu uma aldeia independente de 1890 a 1934. Durante esse tempo, ganhou uma reputação por inovações em negócios, educação e planejamento residencial.<br/><br/>A aldeia de Leclaire em um mapa de 1931 de Edwardsville<br/>Cortesia de Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>A decisão de Nelson de construir uma aldeia não foi feita por capricho. No final da década de 1880, ele era um líder internacional nos campos da cooperação e da participação nos lucros, trocando teorias sociais com outras pessoas em todo o mundo, enquanto expandia seus negócios em St. Louis. Ele nomeou sua vila experimental em homenagem ao sharer de lucro parisiense, Edme Jean Leclaire, mas ele visitou muitos outros visionários sociais que forneceram informações e inspiração. Compilando as melhores ideias desses exemplos, Nelson fundou Leclaire para, em suas palavras, "dar trabalho, promover a inteligência, proporcionar recreação, fomentar a beleza e fazer lares". Estes foram todos os fatores que ele determinou necessários para os homens levarem vidas satisfatórias. Escritores posteriores usaram essas palavras para formular os princípios fundadores de Leclaire: Trabalho, Lares, Educação, Recreação e Beleza, mas com o importante princípio adicional da Liberdade.<br/><br/>Trabalho<br/><br/>O trabalho poderia ser considerado o mais importante desses fatores, pois sem os empregos fabris em Leclaire, não haveria aldeia. Os edifícios da fábrica de tijolos foram projetados pelo arquiteto E. A. Cameron para fornecer luz natural, ventilação no verão e pisos aquecidos no inverno. Havia um sistema de supressão de incêndios e, embora os acidentes industriais não fossem eliminados, todos os esforços foram feitos para garantir a segurança dos trabalhadores. Os edifícios de tijolos cobertos de hera foram cercados por gramados bem cuidados e jardins de flores dando ao complexo uma aparência de campus. Em 1894, a repórter de Nova York Nellie Bly chamou os edifícios de "a perfeição ideal de edifícios para o homem trabalhar".<br/><br/>O complexo de fabricação da N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company em Leclaire<br/>Amigos de Leclaire<br/><br/>As políticas da empresa Nelson foram projetadas para proteger a estabilidade financeira dos funcionários. Os trabalhadores poderiam ganhar uma parte dos lucros e ter uma voz na empresa se escolhessem essa opção. O plano de participação nos lucros deu aos funcionários de Nelson um orgulho de propriedade que resultou em uma força de trabalho de apoio. Houve algumas greves trabalhistas de curta duração ao longo dos anos, mas, na maioria das vezes, os problemas trabalhistas eram raros. Os trabalhadores também tinham horas razoáveis e salários competitivos. Havia um fundo provisório que previa pensões e licenças por doença, bem como pensões de viúva se um trabalhador morresse, independentemente de o falecimento estar ou não relacionado com o emprego.<br/><br/>A sede da empresa para a N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) permaneceu em St. Louis, mas toda a N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company foi transferida para Leclaire. A empresa de fabricação foi dividida em lojas que fabricavam uma variedade de produtos. Em 1900, as lojas tornaram-se empresas independentes para fins fiscais, mas todas ainda eram de propriedade da N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. As lojas incluíam o Gabinete Mill, onde eram produzidos produtos de madeira, desde armários até moinhos. Os artesãos qualificados que trabalharam aqui também cumpriram contratos especiais, incluindo gaiolas de balcão para um banco local e um altar ainda em uso na Igreja Episcopal de St. Andrew em Edwardsville. A Marble Shop especializou-se em mármore arquitetônico que foi cortado e instalado por equipes de Nelson em casas, empresas e até mesmo capitais estaduais em todo o Centro-Oeste. A Machine Shop, que se tornou Bignall e Keeler, fez máquinas de encaixe de tubos, bombas, medidores e várias ferramentas mecânicas esperadas no comércio de encanamento. Eles também se ramificaram para fabricar itens especiais como a Leclaire Bicycle em meados da década de 1890. A Brass Shop incluiu uma fundição onde foram fabricados vários tubos e ferramentas de encanamento. Estes exemplos representam apenas alguns dos trabalhos feitos nas fábricas Leclaire. O logotipo da empresa era um "NONCO" estilizado que ainda pode ser visto em luminárias de encanamento e algumas bocas de incêndio em Edwardsville hoje.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Antes que as casas pudessem ser construídas, a habitação era necessária para os trabalhadores que estavam completando os edifícios da fábrica, bem como a construção de casas. Para atender a essas necessidades, a empresa construiu a "Club House", um grande edifício que serviu a muitos propósitos. Além de hospedagem, foi o primeiro edifício educacional da comunidade, e continha uma biblioteca bem abastecida.<br/><br/>A construção da parte residencial de Leclaire começou imediatamente após a fundação da aldeia em junho de 1890. Julius Pitzman, o inovador arquiteto paisagista que estabeleceu os primeiros lotes em Leclaire, estabeleceu-os com uma série de convênios de proteção. Os convênios previam ruas largas e curvilíneas, grandes lotes e uma restrição de propriedade que limitava as propriedades apenas a fins residenciais ou educacionais. A empresa pavimentou as ruas, forneceu luzes de rua elétricas, instalou calçadas e plantou centenas de árvores ao longo das ruas de Leclaire. Seções posteriores de Leclaire foram dispostas com um design de grade convencional e lotes menores, mas ainda incluíam as restrições de escritura.<br/><br/>Uma casa Leclaire vitoriana em 1907<br/>Direção: Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Inicialmente, as casas foram construídas pela empresa e depois vendidas a um custo próximo aos funcionários de Nelson para incentivar a propriedade da casa. Se um trabalhador adoeceu e não pôde fazer sua hipoteca, os pagamentos foram suspensos até depois que ele voltou ao trabalho. As casas foram oferecidas em uma variedade de projetos de casas e a empresa anunciou que não havia duas casas iguais. As primeiras casas eram principalmente casas vitorianas que vinham com eletricidade e água corrente. Estes foram seguidos por bangalôs, quadrados e até mesmo algumas casas de kit. Os moradores poderiam comprar uma casa construída pela empresa ou comprar um lote vazio e construir uma casa por conta própria, desde que o projeto arquitetônico atendesse aos padrões da empresa.<br/><br/>Nos anos posteriores, lotes foram vendidos para investidores, geralmente residentes de Edwardsville, e muitas casas na década de 1920 foram construídas por empreiteiros locais que depois os venderam para residentes da área.<br/><br/>Ensino superior<br/><br/>Nelson acreditava na educação para todos, incluindo a classe trabalhadora. Programação educacional começou com um jardim de infância no Club House em 1892 e continuou no novo edifício educacional em 722 Holyoake Road. Comumente chamado de "School House", este edifício forneceu um grande salão para reuniões e programas, mas tinha partições móveis para dividi-lo em espaço de sala de aula durante o dia. À noite, havia danças, reuniões ou programas do Leclaire Self-Culture Club, que apresentava palestras semanais de professores da Universidade de Washington ou palestrantes nacionalmente conhecidos que, como N. O. Nelson, faziam parte do movimento de melhoria social na virada do século. Estes incluíram Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones e a autora Charlotte Perkins Gilman, entre outros.<br/><br/>Crianças matriculadas no jardim de infância Leclaire em 1913<br/>Direção: Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nos dez anos seguintes à construção do edifício de educação em 1895, houve uma série de experimentos educacionais, incluindo uma escola industrial, faculdade, escola noturna e uma academia. O mais antigo e mais longevo empreendimento foi o jardim de infância da manhã, fundada em 1892, que usou o modelo Fröbel. Este programa de dois anos era gratuito para todos, incluindo as crianças de Edwardsville, até 1931, quando por razões financeiras a empresa começou a cobrar propinas a estudantes que não eram filhos de funcionários. A Nelson Manufacturing operou um jardim de infância até 1934, quando o edifício foi entregue ao distrito escolar de Edwardsville por uma taxa nominal.<br/><br/>Recreação<br/><br/>Barcos no Lago Leclaire em 1915<br/>Direção: Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreação era uma característica importante de Leclaire. A empresa forneceu instalações esportivas para beisebol, tênis e, mais tarde, futebol. Um salão de bowling e bilhar foi construído e havia um lago para passeios de barco, natação, pesca ou patinação no gelo no inverno. O Parque Leclaire foi mobilado com abrigos para barcos, casas de banho masculinas e femininas e um grande pavilhão. Os moradores organizaram danças, hairides, abelhas ortográficas e outras atividades, e a empresa patrocinou uma banda que tocava regularmente em entretenimentos na aldeia ou em Edwardsville. Como as funções educacionais no Club House e School House, as instalações recreativas em Leclaire estavam abertas a todos e eram muitas vezes um destino para Edwardsville e até mesmo visitantes de St. Louis.<br/><br/>Beleza<br/><br/>Fotografia antiga do Lago Leclaire<br/>Direção: Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>O último dos fatores que Nelson considerava importantes para uma vida satisfatória dizia respeito ao meio ambiente. Nelson sabia sobre a importância de uma vida saudável. Ele valorizava a beleza e a limpeza que podiam ser encontradas no país, e encorajou todos em Leclaire a embelezar sua propriedade plantando jardins e pomares. O próprio Nelson liderou pelo exemplo, de modo que uma estufa da empresa forneceu flores gratuitas e competições foram realizadas para os mais belos pátios. Leclaire foi disposto de modo que toda a vila tivesse um cenário semelhante a um parque ainda evidente hoje.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>A loja Leclaire Cooperative<br/>Direção: Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listou cinco princípios fundadores para Leclaire, mas os escritores modernos adicionam um sexto: Liberdade. Todos os programas oferecidos pela empresa estavam disponíveis para funcionários, bem como residentes locais, mas nenhum era obrigatório. A liberdade de escolher se participar ou não em programas da empresa era inteiramente para o indivíduo. Os residentes de Leclaire podiam trabalhar para a Nelson Manufacturing ou em outro lugar, e os trabalhadores não tinham obrigação de viver em Leclaire. A participação em programas recreativos e educacionais também era opcional. Havia também uma loja da empresa onde os funcionários podiam fazer compras, mas ao contrário de outras cidades da empresa, ninguém estava em dívida com a loja da empresa. A Leclaire Store era uma cooperativa onde os membros eram cobrados preços de mercado justos, mas eram então pagos dividendos trimestrais.<br/><br/>Uma cidade diferente da empresa<br/><br/>Todos esses benefícios tornaram Leclaire única de outras cidades da empresa. Mas também houve casos individuais em que a empresa mostrou compaixão e carinho pelos funcionários. A empresa fechou as fábricas e contratou trens de excursão para levar os trabalhadores e suas famílias para St. Louis por um dia na Feira Mundial de St. Louis de 1904. Quando o dinheiro estava apertado, Nelson ocasionalmente colocava dinheiro extra em cada envelope de pagamento para tornar a vida mais fácil para os trabalhadores, e se ele instituía um programa com o qual os homens não concordavam, eles falavam e, tantas vezes quanto não, Nelson se reverteria.<br/><br/>Nascido em Lillesand, Noruega, em 1841, N. O. Nelson era um homem complicado. Ele era um capitalista que acreditava na livre empresa, mas também um socialista, um seguidor da "Regra de Ouro", e um patriota que serviu para a União na Guerra Civil. Em 1900, ele era multimilionário, mas na época de sua morte, em 1922, ele havia dado tudo para o melhoramento da classe trabalhadora.<br/><br/>Embora Leclaire não fosse o único experimento social de Nelson, é considerado seu empreendimento mais bem-sucedido. Outros grandes esforços para a melhoria social incluem uma cadeia de supermercados cooperativas em Nova Orleans, um jardim de infância para os filhos de funcionários negros em seu Bessemer, Alabama, fábricas e uma casa para os consumidores em Indio, Califórnia.<br/><br/>Aldeia de Nelson de Leclaire foi reconhecido internacionalmente como um experimento notável e bem sucedido. Foi descrito no New York World em inúmeras ocasiões, mas em particular pela repórter Nellie Bly em 1894, que escreveu longamente sobre a cidade modelo onde "A questão do trabalho é resolvida e todo mundo está feliz em uma pequena aldeia perto de St. Louis." O Los Angeles Times também reportou regularmente sobre N. O. Nelson, assim como o Chicago Daily Tribune e inúmeras outras publicações.<br/><br/>Em um discurso na celebração do 15o aniversário de Leclaire em 1915, Nelson disse: "Leclaire estende a você uma hospitalidade ampla e aberta, e oferece-lhe desfrutar hoje a facilidade e conforto e beleza e inspiração que desfrutamos todos os dias." Mais de um século se passou desde aquele dia, mas o convite ainda permanece. Os moradores e pesquisadores são convidados a aprender sobre a história de Leclaire e considerar as lições que podem ser aprendidas para o melhoramento das gerações futuras.<br/><br/>Um dos antigos edifícios do complexo de fabricação em 2019, que agora serve como o N.

| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Visitas do autor via Zoom ou Skype<br/><br/>Estou animado para visitar com seus alunos via Zoom ou Skype! Skype é uma ótima opção para escolas / aulas que não estão trazendo autores em pessoa, mas que querem explorar livros e poesia, se conectar com um autor, e fazer perguntas individuais.<br/><br/>Custos<br/><br/>Eu ofereço visitas de 30-45 minutos de Zoom ou Skype com escolas por US $ 125 por sessão (ou US $ 200 para duas sessões que acontecem dentro de três horas da manhã ou da tarde; US $ 325 para três sessões em um dia; US $ 425 para quatro sessões em um dia). Em cada sessão, tento envolver as crianças o mais ativamente possível. Não, não é o mesmo tipo de conexão que uma visita pessoal oferece, mas ainda pode ser inspirador e motivador para as crianças!<br/><br/>O que eu faço<br/><br/>Cada sessão para até 50 alunos inclui:<br/><br/>5 minutos de configuração técnica<br/><br/>3 segmentos de 10ish-minutos cada — Você escolhe de:<br/><br/>Como me tornei um escritor<br/><br/>Escrevendo este livro em particular (você escolhe em qual livro eu me concentro)<br/><br/>Leitura (leio alguns poemas e as crianças me ajudam a ler outros)<br/><br/>Apresentação em sala de aula (seus alunos colocam uma leitura ou apresentação para mim – um público muito apreciativo!)<br/><br/>Escrevendo um poema juntos<br/><br/>Sessão de perguntas e respostas<br/><br/>5 minutos de adeus / adeus<br/><br/>Eu também converso com aulas de professores de pré-serviço ou grupos de professores em serviço sobre poesia e escrita.<br/><br/>Dicas para uma grande visita virtual<br/><br/>Dicas para uma visita virtual bem-sucedida<br/><br/>Um dos meus objetivos para visitas virtuais à escola é capturar a interatividade que torna as visitas presenciais bem-sucedidas e divertidas. Mas a verdade é que às vezes é difícil ser virtualmente interativo! O tempo pode não sincronizar corretamente, o que torna a leitura em conjunto um desafio, e é realmente difícil para mim ouvir alunos individuais, a menos que eles venham e falem diretamente no microfone / computador. Mas depois de algumas tentativas e erros, descobri algumas maneiras de ter as melhores visitas virtuais possíveis. Aqui estão elas: 10 maneiras de tornar minha visita com seus alunos uma ótima experiência!<br/><br/>Antes da visita<br/><br/>Faça com que as crianças fiquem o mais animadas possível com a visita. Visite meu site com elas. Leia alguns dos meus livros com elas. Reúna algumas perguntas que os alunos têm para mim. Qualquer coisa que você faça antes do tempo para fazer com que pareça um GRANDE NEGÓCIO irá percorrer um longo caminho em direção ao engajamento dos alunos.<br/><br/>Posicione a câmera de vídeo ou laptop com webcam para que eu possa ver o máximo de audiência possível. É difícil avaliar o engajamento do aluno quando eu só posso ver um par de alunos.<br/><br/>Limite cada grupo a 50 alunos. É incrivelmente difícil envolver grandes grupos via vídeo.<br/><br/>Vou passar rapidamente de tópico para tópico ou poema para poema. Por favor, lembre aos alunos que eles precisarão ouvir atentamente para entender o que está acontecendo.<br/><br/>Ocasionalmente, eu faço um pouco de Reader's Theater com os alunos. Se eu lhe enviar quaisquer partes de estudantes roteirizadas com antecedência, imprima uma cópia para cada sessão e corte em pedaços, se necessário.<br/><br/>Durante a visita<br/><br/>Quando eu discutir um livro, se você tem esse livro impresso, por favor, aguarde para que os alunos o vejam.<br/><br/>Você é meu representante. Muitas vezes não consigo chamar os alunos e ouvir respostas individuais. Então, eu poderia dizer: "Vamos ter 3 ideias. Levante a mão se você tiver uma ideia." Então VOCÊ assume, chama três alunos e anuncia essas respostas a todos na sala e a mim.<br/><br/>Escolha alunos confiantes e expatriados para partes de alunos scriptadas (se eu enviar qualquer antes do tempo). Durante minhas visitas presenciais à escola, tento atrair alguns dos alunos menos confiantes, mas descobri que isso não funciona tão bem durante as visitas virtuais porque não posso ouvi-los.<br/><br/>Peça aos alunos com partes de fala que se sentem na frente. Quando chegar a hora, peça-lhes que se lembrem de falar em voz alta.<br/><br/>Nas visitas virtuais, o gerenciamento de comportamento depende exclusivamente de você. Muitas vezes não consigo ver exatamente o que está acontecendo, então entre, se necessário. Se houver uma grande interrupção, apenas me peça para aguentar por um momento para que eu não converse enquanto ninguém está prestando atenção:>)<br/><br/>Sinta-se livre para tirar fotos de mim na tela e compartilhar nas mídias sociais – mesmo que as fotos de mim muitas vezes pareçam ridículas porque estou fazendo rostos engraçados ou algo assim enquanto leio!<br/><br/>Se você tiver alguma dúvida, por favor, pergunte, antes ou durante a visita!<br/><br/>Agendar uma sessão virtual<br/><br/>Você está interessado em agendar uma visita virtual comigo? Basta me enviar um e-mail para marcar uma data, e nós iremos a partir daí |

On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Arquivo de notícias<br/><br/>Novo livro analisa maneiras de enfrentar os desafios do HIV<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis com Marjorie Human que projetou a capa do livro, Agir sobre o HIV.<br/><br/>A pandemia do HIV trouxe o melhor e o pior dos seres humanos em termos de resposta.

| Storyworld Spotlight<br/><br/>25 years of Tomb Raider<br/><br/>Tomb Raider is one of the most recognizable entertainment properties in the world. Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996. The studio was looking for a lead character for their upcoming a 3D adventure game for PlayStation 1. A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

Desde a primeira aparição de Lara Croft em Tomb Raider (1996), suas façanhas como uma exploradora aventureira e espirituosa ressoaram amplamente com os jogadores, ganhando-lhe um lugar no panteão de grandes personagens da cultura pop. Por essa razão, vamos colocar The World of Lara Croft no centro das atenções do Storyworld de 22 de dezembro de 2021 a 6 de março de 2022.<br/><br/>Criando um Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft foi criada pelo estúdio Core Design, em Derby (Reino Unido), em 1996. O estúdio estava à procura de um personagem principal para o seu próximo jogo de aventura 3D para PlayStation 1. Um jogo em uma perspectiva de terceira pessoa, onde os jogadores veriam o personagem principal na íntegra ao longo de cada cena.<br/><br/>Como o jogo era sobre "atacar túmulos misteriosos nas profundezas das pirâmides", o personagem principal precisaria parecer aventureiro e ter os cérebros para sobreviver a missões complexas de assalto. Depois de alguma deliberação, Lara Croft nasceu, uma jovem, de classe alta e totalmente britânica, que era tão enigmática e inteligente como ela era dura e auto-suficiente.<br/><br/>Sucesso e controvérsia<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) foi um sucesso de fuga para Core Design, que rapidamente dobrou na construção de Tomb Raider 2 (1997) e 3 (1998). Uma grande parte do sucesso foi atribuída à principal dama dos jogos, que encontrou admiradores com jogadores masculinos e femininos. Isso desconcertou os críticos que acabaram de ver Lara Croft como um desenho animado sexista.<br/><br/>Explore o mundo de Lara Croft em Storyworld<br/><br/>Esta exposição explora em profundidade a franquia de sucesso.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Imobiliário Palavra do Dia: Opção<br/><br/>Opção: Um acordo para manter aberto, por um período definido, uma oferta para vender ou alugar imóveis. Uma opção pode ser usada, por exemplo, para dar ao comprador tempo para resolver questões de financiamento, título, zoneamento e viabilidade antes de comprometer o comprador a comprar. As opções são freqüentemente usadas no processo de montagem de terras. A opção deve ser apoiada por sua consideração efetiva, separada e independente do preço de compra da propriedade. O mero considerando de consideração por si só não é suficiente, exceto em uma opção de locação em que as disposições da locação são, por si só, considerações suficientes para apoiar a opção. Uma opção meramente cria um direito contratual; não dá ao optionee qualquer propriedade na propriedade. No momento em que a opção é assinada, o proprietário não vende, nem o comprador compra, a propriedade. Embora o proprietário seja obrigado a vender se for avisado pelo comprador, o comprador não é obrigado a comprar. Uma opção de compra também é conhecida como call; uma opção de venda é conhecida como put. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Benefícios dos carotenóides para a pele<br/><br/>Você já ouviu falar de carotenóides? Esses poderosos fitoquímicos são os constituintes pigmentados encontrados em plantas que dão flores, frutas e deixam suas cores amarelas, laranjas e vermelhas.<br/><br/>Desde a década de 1930, os cientistas identificaram cerca de 800 carotenóides e cerca de 40 são encontrados no corpo humano, incluindo a camada mais externa da epiderme, a derme e a gordura subcutânea. Os carotenóides mais comuns são beta-caroteno, alfa-caroteno, luteína, zeaxantina, licopeno e astaxantina. Você pode ler mais sobre a astaxantina aqui.<br/><br/>O conteúdo de carotenóides na pele é influenciado por inúmeros fatores, incluindo a ingestão de frutas e vegetais, sua biodisponibilidade de vários alimentos, suplementação, exposição à radiação UV, poluição do ar, consumo de álcool, tabagismo e estresse.<br/><br/>Como os carotenóides ajudam a minha pele?<br/><br/>Os carotenóides são alguns dos antioxidantes mais conhecidos para a pele e também têm funções importantes como agentes anti-inflamatórios.<br/><br/>Envelhecimento saudável e reparação da pele<br/><br/>Os antioxidantes são essenciais para a pele saudável, pois ajudam a prevenir os danos dos radicais livres às células. Os danos dos radicais livres causam envelhecimento prematuro e o aparecimento de vários tipos de câncer de pele. Os carotenóides, juntamente com a vitamina E, a vitamina C e a enzima Co Q10 são importantes antioxidantes dérmicos.<br/><br/>Devido à sua atividade antioxidante, os carotenóides apoiam e incentivam a produção de colágeno e elastina na pele. Isso ajuda a aumentar a densidade, a espessura, a elasticidade e a firmeza da pele. O colágeno e a elastina diminuem à medida que envelhecemos, então obter carotenóides suficientes na dieta e topicamente é fundamental para envelhecer bem.<br/><br/>Os carotenóides podem melhorar os sinais de fotoenvelhecimento, descoloração da pele, elasticidade, hidratação, textura e podem reduzir a perda de água transepidérmica.<br/><br/>A astaxantina, em particular, estimula os fibroblastos a produzir colágeno e elastina, inibe a atividade das enzimas que decompõem colágeno e elastina e mostra efeitos anti-inflamatórios e filtrantes de UV. Tem sido mostrado para reduzir a melanina na pele, o que resulta na diminuição do aparecimento de sardas e melasma.<br/><br/>Atividade anti-acne: a atividade anti-inflamatória dos carotenóides ajuda a amortecer a inflamação e a irritação associadas à acne. Os carotenóides também ajudam a normalizar e equilibrar as secreções de óleo das glândulas sebáceas. São agentes valiosos na reparação da pele e estimulam a regeneração epidérmica, ajudando a suavizar e suavizar a pele.<br/><br/>Onde posso encontrar carotenóides?<br/><br/>Existem duas maneiras de obter sua dose diária de carotenóides: através da dieta e através da aplicação tópica. A combinação de ambos é a abordagem ideal para cuidados com a pele bem envelhecido.<br/><br/>Os carotenóides são solúveis em gordura, então seu corpo precisa de gordura para absorvê-los (pense em tomates e azeite, brócolis e manteiga, ou espinafre e abacate). Fontes comuns de carotenóides em alimentos são abacate, gemas de ovo, couve, espinafre, cenoura, batata-doce, mamão e tomates.<br/><br/>Embora defendamos obter tantos nutrientes e antioxidantes quanto possível de alimentos em vez de suplementação; um estudo mostrou que a astaxantina combinada com o hidrolisado de colágeno melhorou significativamente a integridade da barreira, reduziu a perda de água transepidérmica e aumentou a expressão de ARNm procolágeno tipo I.<br/><br/>A aplicação tópica é fundamental para uma pele saudável. Estudos mostram que altas concentrações de antioxidantes na pele humana oferecem a melhor proteção para uma pele saudável em qualquer idade.<br/><br/>Na Sarka Botanicals, misturamos plantas inteiras ricas em carotenóides, como calêndula, dente-de-leão e extratos como astaxantina com óleos prensados a frio e ingredientes funcionais. A calêndula sozinha contém mais de 19 tipos diferentes de carotenóides. Estudos mostram que os carotenóides misturados com a coenzima Q10 são especialmente eficazes na redução da inflamação e na desaceleração do envelhecimento prematuro da pele devido à exposição ao sol. |
