| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress.

Johnson assinou a Lei dos Direitos de Voto de 1965.<br/><br/>Anúncios<br/><br/>Há quase um século, a 15a Emenda à Constituição declarou: "O direito de voto dos cidadãos dos Estados Unidos não deve ser negado ou abreviado pelos Estados Unidos ou por qualquer Estado por causa de raça, cor ou condição anterior de servidão." E quase um século antes disso, os pais fundadores de nossa nação colocaram em movimento a grande experiência da democracia americana declarando que "todos os homens são criados iguais".<br/><br/>O Voting Rights Act de 1965 foi um reconhecimento tardio de que, mesmo nos Estados Unidos, nossos ideais fundamentais têm pouco peso se não forem protegidos pelo estado de direito. É por isso que a Seção 2 da 15a Emenda concedeu ao Congresso o "poder de fazer cumprir este artigo por legislação apropriada".<br/><br/>E, de fato, a linguagem codificada do Voting Rights Act foi capaz de alcançar o que o Congresso da era da Reconstrução e Thomas Jefferson não conseguiram. A Lei dos Direitos Civis de 1964 e a Lei dos Direitos de Voto – e o movimento dos direitos civis do qual eles surgiram – serviram como catalisador para um aumento dramático na oportunidade para os negros americanos participarem do processo democrático.<br/><br/>Por exemplo, apenas 6,7 por cento dos Mississippianos negros elegíveis estavam registrados para votar em 1962; em 1969, esse número havia atingido 66,5 por cento. Hoje, o Mississippi tem mais funcionários eleitos negros do que qualquer outro estado.<br/><br/>As proteções estabelecidas pela Lei dos Direitos de Voto estavam há muito atrasadas quando foram aprovadas, representativas da árdua luta com a qual foram alcançadas. Mas, impensável, essas proteções estão agora sob ataque, comprometendo o progresso que nossa nação trabalhou tão duro para alcançar.<br/><br/>No ano passado, no caso Shelby County v. Holder, a Suprema Corte dos EUA eviscerou um componente-chave da Lei de Direitos de Voto que permitiu a revisão federal anterior para garantir a não discriminação antes de qualquer nova lei de votação entrou em vigor.<br/><br/>Anúncios<br/><br/>Infelizmente, a resposta dos líderes republicanos foi não fazer nada. O senador Ted Cruz e o governador Rick Perry fizeram todo o possível para elogiar a decisão da Suprema Corte. O senador Rand Paul rejeitou a necessidade contínua da Lei dos Direitos de Voto, observando: "Temos um presidente afro-americano".<br/><br/>Embora a eleição do presidente Barack Obama tenha sido de fato um marco histórico, é perigoso pensar que nos abstém de permanecer vigilantes contra as conseqüências persistentes do passado de nossa nação. A pressa com que os Estados se moveram para promulgar restrições de votação é a confirmação de que as proteções estabelecidas pela Seção 4 ainda são necessárias.<br/><br/>Anúncios<br/><br/>Governadores republicanos assinaram restrições rígidas de foto-identificação na lei como a solução para um problema virtualmente inexistente de suplantação de eleitores, prejudicando desproporcionalmente mulheres, jovens, famílias trabalhadoras e a comunidade afro-americana. É falso que republicanos como Paul procurem os votos dessas comunidades quando acreditam que "não há nada de errado" em colocar restrições que tornam mais difícil para esses eleitores votarem.<br/><br/>Os republicanos também procuraram restringir os períodos de votação antecipada, incluindo o domingo antes do dia das eleições, quando as igrejas afro-americanas tiveram grande sucesso com os programas Souls to the Polls.<br/><br/>Anúncios<br/><br/>Essas restrições representam um esforço insensível dos republicanos para tornar a votação mais difícil, com base em cálculos políticos estreitos e de curto prazo de que os republicanos podem ganhar eleições reduzindo o tamanho do eleitorado.<br/><br/>Os democratas têm uma missão muito diferente quando se trata de votar: garantir que cada eleitor elegível possa se registrar, que cada eleitor registrado possa votar e que cada voto seja contado com precisão.<br/><br/>Anúncios<br/><br/>O Projeto de Expansão do Eleitor do Comitê Nacional Democrata reflete nossa crença de que uma maior participação eleitoral fortalece nossa nação e nossa democracia. Continuaremos a usar nosso conhecimento institucional inigualável para proteger os direitos de voto contra a legislação e táticas que tentariam suprimir o voto. E porque a melhor defesa é uma boa ofensa, também estamos trabalhando para expandir o voto, implantando nossa tecnologia e recursos de dados para registrar novos eleitores.<br/><br/>Neste aniversário, uma das melhores maneiras que podemos honrar aqueles que lutaram - e em alguns casos deram suas próprias vidas - para a aprovação da legislação é para os republicanos no Congresso para se juntar aos democratas na aprovação do Voting Rights Amendment Act para restaurar a promessa do Voting Rights Act de 1965.<br/><br/>Anúncios<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, uma democrata, representa o 23o Distrito do Congresso da Flórida no Congresso dos Estados Unidos.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | Q&A: Especialista em salvaguardas do Vaticano Pe. Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 de junho de 2021<br/><br/>Pe. Hans Zollner SJ. Imagem: Jesuítas australianos.<br/><br/>O presidente do Centro de Proteção à Criança da Universidade Gregoriana de Roma, e membro da Pontifícia Comissão para a Proteção de Menores, Pe. Hans Zollner SJ, esteve na Austrália em 2018 para falar com líderes do ministério católico e sobreviventes.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh, da Jesuit Communications, sentou-se com ele durante a visita para explorar como a Igreja está respondendo à crise de abuso internacionalmente e o que pode ser aprendido com nossas experiências na Austrália.<br/><br/>MM: Esta é a sua terceira viagem à Austrália. Você visitou vários outros países para ver como a Igreja está respondendo aos abusos em todo o mundo. Você pode nos dar uma ideia de como é o quadro global?<br/><br/>P. Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: Meu entendimento, depois de ter visitado cerca de 50 países em cinco ou seis continentes, é que a Igreja está realmente começando a se mover nos últimos dois anos sobre a questão de fazer justiça às vítimas, de ouvi-las e fazer o que puder em termos de salvaguarda.<br/><br/>Eu estava com os Provinciais Jesuítas de toda a África no final de abril, e o Presidente da Assistência Jesuíta da África e Madagascar está muito comprometido e dedicado a isso. Ele elaborou um plano de ação completo para a formação e para a introdução de diretrizes em todo o lugar. É um esforço muito atencioso e muito deliberado para fazer o que puder ser feito para ser engajado proativamente como jesuítas na África – em um continente onde até alguns anos atrás tudo isso era uma língua estrangeira.<br/><br/>Um dos desafios de tentar desenvolver essa abordagem global é que você está lidando com tantas culturas e tantos entendimentos diferentes. Como você reúne isso e tenta fornecer treinamento e apoio às comunidades religiosas que lidam com essas questões?<br/><br/>Esta é uma das principais questões que temos. Penso que o que posso fazer é estimular a discussão, estimular a reflexão e preparar as pessoas o máximo possível para que possam fazer o trabalho de base.<br/><br/>O Centro de Proteção à Criança da Universidade Gregoriana não pretende ter a resposta para todas as perguntas. Não só porque não conhecemos os contextos específicos - podemos conhecer alguns deles, mas estamos falando de milhares de culturas, estamos falando de centenas de idiomas, estamos falando de origens legais muito diversas. Ele varia mesmo às vezes dentro de um país, como a Austrália, onde você tem estados dentro da Commonwealth da Austrália que têm leis diferentes de outros estados.<br/><br/>Sou alguém que tenta provocar e estimular a discussão e a reflexão. Também estou muito feliz em ouvir as pessoas.<br/><br/>Você mencionou a necessidade de ouvir e apoiar as vítimas para serem ouvidas. Obviamente, tivemos a Comissão Real aqui na Austrália, mas quais são algumas das outras maneiras que você viu que as vozes das vítimas estão sendo apoiadas em todo o mundo?<br/><br/>Na França, existe uma diocese que estabeleceu o que eles chamam de "O espaço de escuta". Lá, as vítimas podem se apresentar e podem se expressar. O bispo está presente. É um espaço aberto em que as pessoas que foram tremendamente feridas são livres, pelo menos, para expressar o que querem pedir à liderança da Igreja, etc.<br/><br/>Há outros lugares nos Estados Unidos ou em outros países onde as vítimas foram convidadas pelas dioceses, pelas províncias, pela liderança da Igreja, para se apresentarem. Eu tenho que dizer que, em geral, eu acho que há uma boa vontade, e há mais pessoas como bispos e provinciais que ouvem as vítimas do que nós sabemos. Mas não há um modelo único para dar às vítimas não apenas o espaço para se expressarem e serem ouvidas, mas também para se envolverem ativamente no desenvolvimento da Igreja.<br/><br/>Em termos de criação de espaços para apoio às vítimas, quais são algumas das coisas que você viu que realmente poderiam ajudar - e que poderíamos estar considerando aqui na Austrália?<br/><br/>Um dos principais pontos que muitas vítimas levantam é: ‘Não podemos ter, dentro dos ambientes paroquiais, dentro dos ambientes escolares, uma conversa regular que inclui sobreviventes de abuso como membros regulares de um comitê, uma comissão, um painel de ressonância, um grupo de feedback ou algo assim?’ Para que essa voz não seja apenas trazida em uma ocasião específica, ou onde uma pessoa sente que está em um ponto em que pode falar sobre isso, mas [é ouvida] regularmente – construa essa voz no sistema.<br/><br/>Isso ajudará a todos nós, ajudará os sobreviventes e as vítimas, porque eles se sentirão bem-vindos e apreciados na experiência específica e nos desafios específicos da vida que passaram. Em segundo lugar, ajudará a comunidade em geral, porque pelo menos podemos nos tornar mais e mais sensíveis às preocupações e necessidades específicas dos sobreviventes - que também podem falar com as necessidades dos jovens.<br/><br/>M: Temos fortes grupos de sobreviventes aqui na Austrália que foram capazes de apoiar uns aos outros através desse processo. Mas o que você está dizendo é que precisamos de alguma maneira de apoiar esses grupos, e apoiar essas pessoas, através de nossas próprias instituições também?<br/><br/>E eu acho que precisamos ser criativos. Vai funcionar para uma escola e uma paróquia e uma diocese de uma maneira, e para outras de uma maneira diferente. Porque os sobreviventes com quem estou em contato constante, eles têm pedidos bastante semelhantes, e experiências semelhantes em relação a ser bem-vindo na Igreja ou não – sentindo-se expulso ou demitido. Mas eles também têm entre si expectativas bastante diferentes. Então aprendi que você também tem que ser muito próximo em aceitar as diferenças no que esse grupo específico, ou esse sobrevivente específico, quer, solicita e precisa.<br/><br/>M: Os sobreviventes falam sobre querer que suas histórias sejam ouvidas e reconhecidas. Tivemos a Comissão Real aqui na Austrália, que forneceu um processo independente onde as vítimas poderiam se apresentar. Há necessidade de algo assim em termos de um processo de verdade, justiça e reconciliação para a Igreja internacionalmente?<br/><br/>H: Sim, eu acho que há uma necessidade para isso internacionalmente. Mas eu acho que primeiro cada igreja local precisa fazer sua própria lição de casa. Não vejo acontecer muito em breve que algum conselho ou comissão desse tipo seja estabelecido para examinar essa área para toda a Igreja. A Igreja tem 1,3 bilhão de membros e está presente em 190 países, com todos os tipos de expectativas em relação ao apoio psicológico, espiritual e financeiro.<br/><br/>Há uma coisa que me deparei consistentemente ao me comunicar, trabalhar e ouvir as vítimas, e é que elas querem ser ouvidas. Portanto, se houvesse a sensação de que as vítimas estavam sendo constantemente ouvidas — em Roma e em outros lugares — penso que isso daria um grande alívio a muitas vítimas.<br/><br/>Penso que a preocupação [do Papa Francisco], especialmente no que diz respeito à sua pergunta, é que as igrejas locais façam tudo o que puderem para que as vítimas sejam ouvidas naquele país em particular. Tenho uma lista de pessoas que querem falar diretamente com o Santo Padre, e fisicamente é impossível. Eu estava lá em 2014 para traduzir para dois sobreviventes alemães que foram escolhidos com dois irlandeses e dois sobreviventes ingleses quando ele recebeu os seis em casa. Ele levou a manhã inteira ouvindo-os um após o outro. Para cada um, ele estava lá por 40 a 45 minutos. Se ele fizesse isso para cada sobrevivente, ele não conseguia mais dormir.<br/><br/>O seu exemplo é um modelo para toda a Igreja Católica da forma como as vítimas e os sobreviventes são recebidos, acolhidos e ouvidos. Eu acho que se os bispos e os provinciais neste mundo, em todos os países, seguissem seu exemplo, muitos sobreviventes ficariam realmente agradecidos por isso.<br/><br/>O Arcebispo Diarmud Martin foi citado recentemente, pouco antes do Encontro Mundial das Famílias, sobre a Pontifícia Comissão, dizendo que ela é muito pequena, pois está atualmente configurada para alcançar o que precisa alcançar. Qual é a sua visão sobre isso? A Igreja precisa colocar mais recursos em como está supervisionando essas questões?<br/><br/>No momento, somos 16 membros de basicamente todos os continentes, e os principais grupos linguísticos. Representamos uma variedade de disciplinas e profissões, e o propósito da comissão – como os estatutos que acabam de ser promulgados – é fornecer conselhos ao Santo Padre.<br/><br/>Um mal-entendido comum sobre a Comissão é, em primeiro lugar, que lidamos com casos de alegações, o que não é o caso. Não temos poder jurídico ou administrativo em relação aos casos, porque quando se trata de alegações de abuso, os tribunais e o procedimento são estabelecidos.<br/><br/>Um segundo mal-entendido é que promovemos, diretamente, as coisas no terreno. Nosso primeiro e principal objetivo é que aconselhemos o Santo Padre sobre questões.<br/><br/>Então, do meu ponto de vista, sim, precisamos investir mais. Mas precisamos investir mais a nível local, e precisamos garantir que as propostas da Pontifícia Comissão sejam transmitidas ao Santo Padre – o que normalmente o Presidente faz – e, depois, haja um processo de acompanhamento que reflita o que demos como nosso conselho.<br/><br/>Na Austrália, a Catholic Professional Standards Limited está supervisionando a resposta da Igreja e fornecendo diretrizes e apoio para garantir que todas as instituições da Igreja sejam instituições seguras para crianças. Há necessidade de algum tipo de apoio organizacional de Roma para os bispos e dioceses que estão lutando para formar essas instituições e fornecer salvaguardas nessas dioceses?<br/><br/>Penso que, em última análise, a Comissão irá desenvolver-se nessa linha, estando agora em processo de contratação de peritos nessas áreas.<br/><br/>Penso que a Igreja precisa de compreender que as Igrejas locais podem aprender umas das outras. E a minha compreensão sempre foi – e penso que o Santo Padre nos lembrou – que a Igreja não funcionará como uma empresa centralizada. Não funciona assim, efetivamente. Cada bispo, cada conferência episcopal, tem, em certa medida, sua própria vida. O que precisamos aprender mais é abrir canais de comunicação mútua.<br/><br/>Há uma série de coisas que as pessoas culpam por abuso na Igreja. Como padre e psicólogo, e como alguém que conheceu e trabalhou com sobreviventes, quais são suas opiniões sobre essa questão?<br/><br/>Penso que a questão de onde vem o abuso é a mais importante, e o Papa abordou isso na sua carta ao povo de Deus publicada em 20 de agosto. Ele diz no primeiro parágrafo, e repete-o repetidamente, que a questão do abuso sexual está sempre ligada – ou quase sempre ligada – não apenas à questão do abuso de poder, mas também ao abuso de consciência.<br/><br/>Portanto, a verdadeira questão fundamental do abuso é muito mais complexa do que apenas a questão da sexualidade – seja heterossexual ou homossexual. É uma questão de poder, e lá temos que realmente trabalhar sobre a questão de como entendemos o sacerdócio, como entendemos o episcopado, como entendemos e vivemos nossos ministérios? Quais são os limites?<br/><br/>É por isso que estou muito feliz que a Província Jesuíta da Austrália esteja estabelecendo um Código de Conduta. Porque não falamos apenas de abuso sexual de menores. Falamos sobre abuso sexual de adultos, e falamos sobre abuso de outras maneiras - como abuso de consciência, onde você dita a alguém o que você pensa, ou você finge saber por Deus, e você pode dizer a outra pessoa, 'Você precisa fazer isso', contra a consciência dessa pessoa.<br/><br/>Muitas pessoas pensam que o celibato produz abuso. Como eu sempre digo, o celibato como tal não é causa de abuso – caso contrário, como explicamos que 99,9% de todos os abusadores não vivem uma vida celibatária, e como explicamos que 95% ou 96% de todos os padres não abusam de menores? Mas, o celibato, ou um voto de castidade, que não é realmente integrado, que não é realmente vivido corretamente – sim, isso produz um problema. Às vezes as pessoas levam para beber, às vezes levam para o jogo, e às vezes levam para a má conduta sexual, com adultos e com menores.<br/><br/>A verdadeira questão sobre isso é como lidar com a noção de poder espiritual religioso com o qual sacerdotes e bispos são investidos? Como a teologia pode nos ajudar a entender, e talvez como a sociologia, a psicologia ou a administração de empresas podem nos ajudar a definir os limites do poder e a necessidade de manter seus limites? |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Não estou surpreso com essa discrepância. Na verdade, eu até diria que isso não é algo que nunca vai mudar, nem deveríamos ficar todos animados sobre mudá-lo. Em 10 anos, ainda teremos itens complexos na maior lista de preocupações, e as coisas que finalmente vamos entender serão as principais partes de nossos gastos.<br/><br/>Agora, Gunnar e Andy têm excelentes pontos, especificamente sobre as equipes de TI verem problemas de TI e resolvê-los com soluções de TI; na verdade, eu estou certo de que seus pontos têm mérito.<br/><br/>Mas eu acho que há outras ideias que superam aqueles (eu comentei em seus blogs sobre isso, e depois decidiu que eu deveria apenas blog aqui). Essas principais preocupações 3 são sangrando novo tal que:<br/><br/>Tememos coisas novas porque não as compreendemos, ou não as compreendemos porque são novas.<br/><br/>Eles são novos demais para termos abordagens sólidas para lidar com eles.<br/><br/>eles são novos demais para sabermos se devemos estar preocupados ou não! nós tendemos a nos tornar paranóicos/preocupados, o que é bom!<br/><br/>muito novo para ter itens de orçamento óbvios atribuídos a eles. Posso comprar uma caixa ou algum software que forneça "segurança de nuvem" ou "segurança de mídia social"?<br/><br/>eles são tão novos que o negócio nem sabe como usá-los ou o que eles querem deles. Muito menos como podemos protegê-los enquanto ainda atender ou pelo menos não pisotear todas as necessidades do negócio. Se a empresa ainda não sabe como usá-los, não tenho certeza de que a segurança esteja em posição de orientar esse uso com segurança.<br/><br/>Também deve ser mencionado que essas coisas novas estão sendo empurradas em grande parte através da terra do consumidor e para o negócio, com a TI como uma espécie de, "Oh sim", pensou. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth são todas as respostas de TI para problemas tipicamente de TI. É claro que há uma diferença. Eles também são questões muito subjetivas, em oposição a itens muito objetivos como firewalls, bits maliciosos conhecidos, comportamentos, assinaturas, portas. Os negócios apresentam problemas muito complexos que muitas vezes envolvem pessoas (que não podemos corrigir) e que muitas vezes não se encaixam bem nas regras gerais. Mesmo que nos afastássemos de soluções técnicas e dediquemos nosso tempo a resolver esses problemas, eles ainda não serão resolvidos de forma ordenada. Da mesma forma, quando o empurrão vem para empurrar, você pode ter e atingir metas com firewalls? Você pode mostrar melhorias? Tudo isso flui do aspecto não-técnico bastante subjetivo dessas questões. Tipo a diferença entre o boletim de uma criança e o feedback que você recebe de uma conferência de pais-professores. Se você tem um filho, qual você estaria mais inclinado a discordar ou não necessariamente acreditar? (A resposta é a subjetiva!)<br/><br/>Pode-se dizer que esta é a progressão natural da segurança e da tecnologia: do reforço dos controles técnicos à elevação da pilha em direção ao comportamento e às pessoas. Claro, essas 3 principais preocupações podem ser ditas para perfurar através de firewalls e segmentos de rede, mas essa é a natureza dessas coisas (a mídia social "perfurar" através de um firewall é muito diferente do que eu perfurar através de uma conexão SSH para conectar minha rede doméstica; mídia social é semelhante ao *way* Eu uso minha conexão SSH depois que a retenção já é usada porque é necessária; ou seja, a porta de mídia social é 80.<br/><br/>Basicamente, todas as indicações apontam para não se surpreender com essa dicotomia. E eu não acho que isso seja mais uma indicação de que a TI/segurança está fazendo errado, ou não está alinhada corretamente com os negócios, ou tem um fundo técnico de sala de servidores escuros. Não estou dizendo que estamos fazendo as coisas direito ou estamos devidamente alinhados, mas o acima não é um bom argumento para apoiar a teoria dessas deficiências.<br/><br/>Agora para um salto realmente grande. Eu compararia o aumento atual na computação móvel a ser tão grande quanto a introdução de computadores no negócio e mais tarde o PC / Internet no negócio. Agora, eu não estava por perto quando o primeiro aconteceu, nem eu estava na indústria quando a revolução do computador pessoal varreu para os negócios, mas eu aposto que é a comparação mais próxima até agora. Eu posso até dizer o mesmo para as mídias sociais. Estes são novos e são grandes mudanças além de apenas trazer Macs ou novos softwares ou algum novo processo de negócios. |
