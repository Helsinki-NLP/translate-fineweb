| Quidditch through the ages<br/><br/>I was doodling some quidditch-related objects like broomsticks and snitches and whatnot and it sort of turned into this odd compilation of things, including Harry down there at the bottom. I am not completely satisfied with the way it came out, but since it's not bad for my second Harry Potter fan-art picture, I decided to color it anyway. If you are wondering where his scar is, it's there, but it's very very light and small because I did that bit on the computer. Sketched in pen, colored in Paint. | Quidditch através das eras<br/><br/>Eu estava rabiscando alguns objetos relacionados ao quidditch, como varas de vassoura e travessuras e coisas assim, e isso se transformou em uma compilação estranha de coisas, incluindo Harry lá embaixo. Eu não estou completamente satisfeito com a forma como saiu, mas como não é ruim para minha segunda imagem de arte de fãs de Harry Potter, decidi colori-la de qualquer maneira. Se você está se perguntando onde está a cicatriz dele, está lá, mas é muito, muito leve e pequena porque eu fiz esse pouco no computador. Esboçado em caneta, colorido em Paint. |
| I just started saltwater fly fishing this summer and I need a new reel, so it'll definitely be the Kraken. (I'm in Florida; we don't have those little trout minnow things around here. ) Private Message on the way to you.<br/><br/>I'm thrilled and flattered. I'm also trying to figure out a way to explain to She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed that I'll need to buy a new rod worthy of this reel.....<br/><br/>I've always found that no explanation is the best explanation. Don't give her a reason to ever say you're not spontaneous enough. | Eu comecei a pescar mosca de água salgada neste verão e eu preciso de um novo carretel, então definitivamente será o Kraken.

Também estou a tentar descobrir uma forma de explicar a She-Who-Must-Be-Obeyed que vou precisar de comprar uma nova haste digna deste carretel.....<br/><br/>Eu sempre achei que nenhuma explicação é a melhor explicação.

| If you were admitted and enrolled --> yes If you were admitted and attended another school --> yes If you took extension courses (do they even have them there? I know UCLA does) --> yes If you went to graduate school there --> yes<br/><br/>That's my interpretation because any of these scenarios would fulfill either being "admitted to an undergraduate program" or "taking courses" at UC Berkeley. I could be completely wrong though, you're better off just calling them and clarifying your specific situation.<br/><br/>My opinion: Based on the wording, I interpreted it as asking if you were admitted to Berkeley undergrad, whether or not you chose to attend. If it meant admitted and attended, they could easily have seen that through the "Undergrad Institutions" portion of the application. | Se você foi admitido e matriculado --> sim Se você foi admitido e participou de outra escola --> sim Se você fez cursos de extensão (eles ainda os têm lá? Eu sei que a UCLA faz) --> sim Se você foi para a escola de pós-graduação lá --> sim<br/><br/>Essa é a minha interpretação porque qualquer um desses cenários cumpriria seja sendo "admitido em um programa de graduação" ou "fazendo cursos" na UC Berkeley. Eu poderia estar completamente errado, mas é melhor você ligar para eles e esclarecer sua situação específica.<br/><br/>Minha opinião: Com base na redação, eu interpretei como perguntando se você foi admitido na graduação de Berkeley, se você escolheu ou não participar. Se isso significasse admitido e atendido, eles poderiam facilmente ter visto isso através da parte "Instituições Undergrad" do aplicativo. |
| ...........A lot of the time head bolts are angle tightened so you set them at say 20Nm for a starting point then angle tighten them from there.<br/><br/>.....I would have preferred a bigger hammer<br/><br/>Cheers.<br/><br/>You can never have too big a hammer<br/><br/>I'll confess.<br/>There must be a fine distinction between torque setting with a Click torque wrench and angle setting but even as an engineer, I don't really understand it.<br/><br/>To me, if you tighten a bolt you get to a point when it locks. And as TTT says at a relatively low torque. After that, further tightening both increases the torque load and the head angle ??<br/><br/>To me it's a distinction between measurement techniques rather then final result. If anyone can explain why one instead of the other I'd be greatful ??<br/><br/>I'm sure other old farts will remember old style torque wrenches with the separate pointer that swung around a graduated scale as you put load on them.<br/>Graduated in Ft Lbs, measurement in angle.<br/>Aren't these just a variation on the theme ?? | .............Muitos dos parafusos de cabeça de tempo são ângulo apertado então você colocá-los em digamos 20Nm para um ponto de partida, em seguida, o ângulo apertar-los a partir daí.<br/><br/>Eu teria preferido um martelo maior.<br/><br/>Adeus.<br/><br/>Você nunca pode ter um martelo muito grande<br/><br/>Eu confesso.<br/>Deve haver uma distinção fina entre a definição do torque com uma chave do torque do clique e a definição do ângulo mas mesmo como um coordenador, eu realmente não entendo.<br/><br/>Para mim, se você apertar um parafuso, você chega a um ponto em que ele trava. E como diz TTT em um torque relativamente baixo. Depois disso, apertar ainda mais aumenta a carga de torque e o ângulo da cabeça ??<br/><br/>Para mim, é uma distinção entre técnicas de medição e não o resultado final. Se alguém pode explicar por que um em vez do outro eu seria grande ??<br/><br/>Tenho certeza que outros velhos peidos se lembrarão de chaves de torque de estilo antigo com o ponteiro separado que balançava em torno de uma escala graduada à medida que você coloca carga sobre eles.<br/>Graduado em Ft Lbs, medida em ângulo.<br/>Não são apenas uma variação do tema?? |
| Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Report This Article<br/><br/>Winter Protection for Fig Trees<br/><br/>Overview<br/><br/>The fig tree has been around since at least 5,000 B.C., and is grown throughout the world for its delicious fruit. Figs grow well in a mild climate without weather extremes. The fig tree is now propagated in some areas with harsh winters. Protective precautions are required to save the tree from winter damage.<br/><br/>Potted Fig Trees<br/><br/>Ornamental fig trees in pots can stand some freezing and do not require light once they enter the winter dormancy phase. Avoid extreme swings in temperature by placing the fig tree in a controlled environment such as a garage, where temperatures range between slightly under freezing and slight above. The plant should be watered as the soil dries.<br/><br/>Shielding<br/><br/>Shielding to protect the tree from the most extreme winter weather is required. Fig trees require placement in soil areas where the soil does not freeze to protect it from disease and increase its chances of winter survival. Large screens placed around the tree protects it from winter winds that can damage and freeze the wood.<br/><br/>Wrapping<br/><br/>Tree wrapping protects the tree from cold weather and prevents hard winds from destroying the branches. Fig tree wrapping should be applied once the leaves from the tree have fallen to prevent leaves from rotting inside the wrapping material. Fig trees are sensitive to slight temperature changes. It can not warm up inside the protective film or else the tree may begin to grow, making it susceptible to severe damage during the cold snap.<br/><br/>Planting<br/><br/>Cultivar practices help to protect the fig tree during harsh winters. Varieties that are resistant to cold weather are best for locations where the weathers are harsh. Brown Turkey, Brunswick and Blue Celeste are good cultivars for cold weather. Planting should be done against a wall or structure that will radiate heat towards the tree during the winter months.<br/><br/>Snow<br/><br/>Roots of the fig tree require dry soil during the winter dormancy period. Watering should be done only when the soil is dry and the roots should be protected from melting snow and rain. Protection placed on the ground under the tree, near the trunk--to keep water from draining into the soil--protects the tree from damage.<br/><br/>Keywords:<br/>fig tree protection, fig tree winter, fig tree care | Proteção de inverno para figueiras<br/><br/>Denunciar este artigo<br/><br/>Proteção de inverno para figueiras<br/><br/>Visão geral<br/><br/>A figueira existe desde pelo menos 5.000 aC, e é cultivada em todo o mundo por seus deliciosos frutos.

O envoltório da árvore da figueira deve ser aplicado uma vez que as folhas da árvore caíram para evitar que as folhas apodreçam dentro do material de envoltório. As figueiras são sensíveis a pequenas mudanças de temperatura. Não pode aquecer dentro da película protetora ou então a árvore pode começar a crescer, tornando-a suscetível a danos graves durante o estalo frio.<br/><br/>Plantação<br/><br/>As práticas de cultivo ajudam a proteger a figueira durante os invernos rigorosos. Variedades que são resistentes ao clima frio são melhores para locais onde o clima é severo. Brown Turkey, Brunswick e Blue Celeste são boas cultivares para climas frios. O plantio deve ser feito contra uma parede ou estrutura que irá irradiar calor para a árvore durante os meses de inverno.<br/><br/>Snow<br/><br/>As raízes da figueira exigem solo seco durante o período de dormência de inverno. A rega deve ser feita apenas quando o solo estiver seco e as raízes devem ser protegidas do derretimento da neve e da chuva.

| Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>Oculus CEO, Palmer Luckey, has not minced his words when asked in an interview whether the Rift VR headset will ever support the Mac. If you had any hopes of it being soon, you might want to ready yourselves for some disappointment.<br/><br/>That is up to Apple. If they ever release a good computer, we will do it.<br/><br/>What he's referring to there in a less diplomatic sense is the discrete graphics required to run the Rift. The simple truth is that Apple just doesn't go for high-end graphics that will meet the requirements for the headset. For context, on a Windows PC, you need a minimum of an NVIDIA GTX 970, a $300 graphics card.<br/><br/>As Luckey went on to say:<br/><br/>It just boils down to the fact that Apple doesn't prioritize high-end GPUs. You can buy a $6,000 Mac Pro with the top of the line AMD FirePro D700, and it still doesn't match our recommended specs. So if they prioritize higher-end GPUs like they used to for a while back in the day, we'd love to support Mac. But right now, there's just not a single machine out there that supports it.<br/><br/>The Mac Pro can't be accused of not packing plenty of horsepower, because it does, but equally FirePro graphics are targeted more towards the creative market, just like the Mac Pro. The Mac Pro in particular far exceeds other hardware requirements, but naturally as the Rift is graphics heavy, this is where the shortfall is. Luckey is perhaps being a little over the top, but equally he's the man behind the Rift, so there's no doubts plenty of truth to what he says. Even if he doesn't say it particularly well.<br/><br/>What say you, Mac owners of the world? Are you even bothered about the Oculus Rift or is it something you wish you could have? Sound off in the comments below!<br/><br/>Reader comments<br/><br/>Oculus CEO comes down hard on Mac support for the Rift<br/><br/>No, not bothered by it since I really wasn't planning on buying an Oculus Rift. For me the product category is still too early and too much in a beta-kinda phase. But he does rise a valid point. Apple should try to get more ahead of the pack CPU/GPU wise. Right now they're always trailing behind.<br/><br/>Excuse me, but what is HTC Vive better at? And Oculus Rift most certainly supports Linux machines that meet their hardware specifications! (The issue is not OS but hardware.)<br/><br/>Also, look at WHY the HTC Vive supports OS X: it includes more of its own hardware. (Which is why it costs so much.) The Oculus solutions - both the Rift and the Samsung Gear VR - require the hardware that it is plugging into to perform more of the heavy lifting.<br/><br/>VR isn't a gimmick. 3D TVs don't always give that much of a 3d effect, and it doesn't work with everyone. VR works with everyone, and the Oculus and HTC Vive official release products have almost no latency so there shoudn't be any motion sickness. There's also plenty of game support<br/><br/>Obviously if gaming is a priority you're generally not in the market for a Mac, though. Not many game developers support OSX so these types of devices likely have limited use on a Mac (for gaming, anyways, which the Rift was designed for). At least that's the only reason I could see myself using one. I definitely wouldn't use it for watching movies.<br/><br/>Apple did implement the Metal engine into El Capitan, there might be some plan to go into the gaming market (as Apple learned from iOS how big this market is, just look at the top grossing apps).<br/>So now the hardware is missing and and game devs would probably show some interest, since Macs there are now an acceptable amount of Mac users around the world.<br/><br/>I would like to see Apple make its way into that sector of the industry. I don't use any Apple products presently but they're making a lot of the right moves in many areas and I'm very intrigued.<br/><br/>Plus, competition fuels innovation. I know that major computer part manufactures already create that competition but Apple has the RnD willpower and the cash to really turn heads. They may not win the numbers games in terms of specs, they actually rarely do, but most people who care to do the research know that performance != the sum of the device's parts. Apple can do more with "less". On paper their products appear inferior but when carefully balanced hardware meets specifically engineered software they generally perform just as well as the competition if not out perform.<br/><br/>HA! I love how, all of a sudden, having a high performance computer is not important to Apple phans! There is not a single Mac capable of the highest end graphics. Can't buy one, can't build one. Mac is not capable of being the highest in performance and you are good with that. HA! Classic!<br/><br/>I bought my MacBook Pro Retina in 2012 because of the high resolution screen and the non-discrete GPU. However, for my desktop I built a system with a 4K monitor, i7 4790K CPU, 3 GTX 970 GPU's, and 16 gb of memory all for less than what I'd pay for an iMac. I even have an SSD set up to boot in OSX. My point is Apple could do similar things if it wished, but doesn't. In fact, look at the most recent iMac. It includes discrete graphics and a slow 5400 RPM drive. My computer may not look as pretty, and it's not as thin, but in the end it's more useful - isn't that why we buy a computer in the first place?<br/><br/>I don't see why a Mac pro can not make use of the Oculus isn't it built for rendering video. I understand that it will not be able to run on iMac's and because of this the Oculus should be branded for Pro users due to the requirements and come at the price.<br/><br/>Now people are saying that your computer is doing ALL the heavy lifting, so why is the price point over $800 for something that isn't doing anything?<br/><br/>I'm excited about the direction of VR but not where it is at the moment.<br/><br/>Your display (which the Rift is) never does any of the heavy lifting. It's $800 because of what the display does; 110° viewing angle (still not human eye but much closer than other displays) with super low latency to reduce or eliminate motion sickness on a 1200x1800 per eye display for HD quality.<br/><br/>And yes, Mac's are very widely used for video rendering, but that rendering doesn't happen at 30+fps. It can take video rendering machines hours to render a single frame and sometimes years to render an entire movie. The final products, or pre-rendered material, is what then becomes 30+fps.<br/><br/>Thank you @TheRealFixxer<br/>Alot of what you say makes sense and some I was unaware of.<br/><br/>I guess I don't see VR as a game, but as an immersion and seeing Mac's are good at 3dcad and compiling video I would think they would be able to compile a scene well. I've even seen 3d renders of movie walk through. Creating a 3d world and placing cameras in areas to figure out how a scene would look<br/><br/>But I agree Mac's make more use of CPU cycles even by using there GPU's to help. WIth that said there are other directions one could take it. Like external thunderbolt video cards.<br/><br/>My big grip is the fact Octulas is looked at as a consumer product. If the requirements are that high, then it's more a pro product and needs to be advertized as that. I understand the technology is there but don't feel it's there to call it a consumer product.<br/><br/>Yes, you are right. Apple also has issues with software. Most aren't using "metal" the apple programming language which speeds up the processing for games because it's an Apple only solution where many use game engines that work on Microsoft Direct X or open source Opengl which most games use to run on Linux and oSX. Opengl is around 20% slower and sometime a lot more than that compared to direct x so a top of the line gaming card running in oSX runs as fast is a mid level gaming card in windows. So big problems not to mention most macs have built in cards that have no upgradability.<br/><br/>The mac pro is so different that Apple would have to do this as it wouldn't be worth a card vendor doing this as there is no profit in it for them with the small amount of possible buyers there would be for this. Apple doesn't like to loose money so I don't see this ever happening. Apple would loose money offering video card upgrades for mac pros.<br/><br/>Well he has a point though I do t care about oculus rift, rather wait for starVR. There should be an option to add better GPUs into an iMac and MacBook Pro. It is also sad that there is no more nVidia card, I liked the CUDA support now I will have to buy a PC and install Linux for my CUDA projects.<br/><br/>Gaming is a growing market and it won't be long until even iPhones have more GPU performance than the Macs. I agree that Apple should offer a high end GPU in a Mac<br/><br/>I am very bothered by the lack of high performance discrete graphics on Mac computers. Even the top of the like iMac uses an out of date mobile GPU which, of course, cannot be upgraded. If I want to develop software for VR, Apple has left me no choice but to buy or build a PC to run it on. As a big Apple fan (yes I admit it) this make me rather sad.<br/><br/>BTW, VR is not some passing fad. If you have tried it you know what I mean. VR is going to change gaming and content creation forever. My only worry about VR is that is too good. There could be millions of people that will become addicted to living and playing in virtual worlds. Look at how many people got addicted to MMOs that played on a flat screen. With VR you really feel like you are in the game.<br/><br/>Not worried about anything, i am pretty sure apple will have its own implementation for Mac and iOS when tech will be ready for consumers, right now it is more for hardcore users. Like always apple like to time its presence on right time, with right product. Have faith in apple.<br/><br/>It's funny that a lot of people know which vr is better based on os support. I guess you guys did heavy testing and now are the guy in the big electronic store that knows best.<br/><br/>HTC said it will bring support to the osx but that still needs to be seen.<br/><br/>I understand that a lot of you guys are stamped on there d**ks. But understand that Apple is more focused on laptops. And laptops can't be packed with more power than a PC, due to size, heat, power consumption etc.<br/><br/>He is right, even though he put it in **** terms. I love my Mac but Lord it needs a boost in graphics. Not that it needs to cost more but I would be more than willing to pay a little extra for a better graphics card or at least have the option to install my own. It's really too bad this guy had to make his statement sound like he is just plain uneducated. | CEO da Oculus desiste do suporte para Mac para o Rift<br/><br/>O CEO da Oculus, Palmer Luckey, não cortou suas palavras quando perguntado em uma entrevista se o fone de ouvido Rift VR jamais suportará o Mac. Se você tivesse alguma esperança de que seja em breve, você pode querer se preparar para alguma decepção.<br/><br/>Isso depende da Apple. Se eles lançarem um bom computador, faremos isso.<br/><br/>O que ele está se referindo lá em um sentido menos diplomático é os gráficos discretos necessários para executar o Rift. A verdade simples é que a Apple simplesmente não vai para gráficos de alta qualidade que atenderão aos requisitos para o fone de ouvido. Para o contexto, em um PC com Windows, você precisa de um mínimo de uma NVIDIA GTX 970, uma placa gráfica de US $ 300.<br/><br/>Como Luckey continuou a dizer:<br/><br/>Isso se resume ao fato de que a Apple não prioriza GPUs high-end. Você pode comprar um Mac Pro de US $ 6.000 com o topo da linha AMD FirePro D700, e ainda não corresponde às nossas especificações recomendadas. Então, se eles priorizarem GPUs de ponta como costumavam fazer por um tempo, adoraríamos dar suporte ao Mac. Mas agora, simplesmente não há uma única máquina lá fora que o suporte.<br/><br/>O Mac Pro não pode ser acusado de não ter muita potência, porque ele faz, mas igualmente os gráficos FirePro são direcionados mais para o mercado criativo, assim como o Mac Pro. O Mac Pro em particular excede em muito outros requisitos de hardware, mas, naturalmente, como o Rift é pesado em gráficos, é aqui que está o déficit. Luckey talvez esteja um pouco exagerado, mas também é o homem por trás do Rift, então não há dúvidas de muita verdade sobre o que ele diz. Mesmo que ele não diga isso particularmente bem.<br/><br/>O que você acha, donos de Mac do mundo? Você está mesmo preocupado com o Oculus Rift ou é algo que você gostaria de ter? Soe nos comentários abaixo!<br/><br/>Comentários dos leitores<br/><br/>CEO da Oculus desiste do suporte para Mac para o Rift<br/><br/>Não, não se incomodou com isso, já que eu realmente não estava planejando comprar um Oculus Rift. Para mim, a categoria de produto ainda é muito cedo e muito em uma fase beta. Mas ele levanta um ponto válido. A Apple deve tentar ficar mais à frente do pacote CPU / GPU sábia. Neste momento, estão sempre atrás.<br/><br/>Com licença, mas o que o HTC Vive é melhor? E o Oculus Rift certamente suporta máquinas Linux que atendem às especificações de hardware! (O problema não é o sistema operacional, mas o hardware.)<br/><br/>Além disso, veja POR QUE o HTC Vive suporta o OS X: ele inclui mais do seu próprio hardware. (É por isso que custa tanto.) As soluções Oculus - tanto o Rift quanto o Samsung Gear VR - exigem o hardware que está sendo conectado para realizar mais do trabalho pesado.<br/><br/>A realidade virtual não é um truque. As TVs 3D nem sempre dão muito efeito 3D, e isso não funciona com todos. A realidade virtual funciona com todos, e os produtos oficiais de lançamento da Oculus e do HTC Vive quase não têm latência, então não deve haver enjôo. Há também um monte de suporte ao jogo<br/><br/>Obviamente, se os jogos são uma prioridade, você geralmente não está no mercado para um Mac, no entanto. Não muitos desenvolvedores de jogos suportam OSX, portanto, esses tipos de dispositivos provavelmente têm uso limitado em um Mac (para jogos, de qualquer maneira, para o qual o Rift foi projetado). Pelo menos essa é a única razão pela qual eu poderia me ver usando um. Eu definitivamente não iria usá-lo para assistir a filmes.<br/><br/>A Apple implementou o mecanismo Metal no El Capitan, pode haver algum plano para entrar no mercado de jogos (como a Apple aprendeu com o iOS o quão grande é esse mercado, basta olhar para os principais aplicativos de receita).<br/>Então, agora o hardware está faltando e os desenvolvedores de jogos provavelmente mostrariam algum interesse, já que os Macs agora têm uma quantidade aceitável de usuários de Mac em todo o mundo.<br/><br/>Eu gostaria de ver a Apple entrar nesse setor da indústria. Eu não uso nenhum produto da Apple no momento, mas eles estão fazendo muitos movimentos certos em muitas áreas e estou muito intrigado.<br/><br/>Além disso, a concorrência alimenta a inovação. Eu sei que as principais fabricantes de computadores já criam essa concorrência, mas a Apple tem a força de vontade RnD e o dinheiro para realmente virar as cabeças. Eles podem não ganhar os jogos de números em termos de especificações, eles realmente raramente fazem, mas a maioria das pessoas que se preocupam em fazer a pesquisa sabe que o desempenho != a soma das partes do dispositivo. A Apple pode fazer mais com "menos". No papel, seus produtos parecem inferiores, mas quando o hardware cuidadosamente equilibrado encontra software especificamente projetado, eles geralmente funcionam tão bem quanto a concorrência, se não funcionar.<br/><br/>HA! Eu amo como, de repente, ter um computador de alto desempenho não é importante para os fanáticos da Apple! Não há um único Mac capaz dos gráficos de ponta mais altos. Não pode comprar um, não pode construir um. Mac não é capaz de ser o mais alto em desempenho e você é bom com isso. HA! Clássico!<br/><br/>Comprei meu MacBook Pro Retina em 2012 por causa da tela de alta resolução e da GPU não discreta. No entanto, para o meu desktop eu construí um sistema com um monitor 4K, CPU i7 4790K, 3 GPUs GTX 970 e 16 gb de memória, tudo por menos do que eu pagaria por um iMac. Eu até tenho um SSD configurado para inicializar no OSX. Meu ponto é que a Apple poderia fazer coisas semelhantes se quisesse, mas não. Na verdade, olhe para o iMac mais recente. Inclui gráficos discretos e uma unidade lenta de 5400 RPM. Meu computador pode não parecer tão bonito, e não é tão fino, mas no final é mais útil - não é por isso que compramos um computador em primeiro lugar?<br/><br/>Eu não vejo por que um Mac pro não pode fazer uso do Oculus não é construído para renderização de vídeo. Eu entendo que ele não será capaz de rodar em iMacs e por causa disso o Oculus deve ser rotulado para usuários Pro devido aos requisitos e vem ao preço.<br/><br/>Agora as pessoas estão dizendo que seu computador está fazendo todo o trabalho pesado, então por que o preço está acima de US $ 800 para algo que não está fazendo nada?<br/><br/>Estou empolgado com a direção da VR, mas não onde ela está no momento.<br/><br/>Sua exibição (que é o Rift) nunca faz qualquer um dos levantamentos pesados. É de US $ 800 por causa do que a tela faz; ângulo de visão de 110 ° (ainda não olho humano, mas muito mais perto do que outras telas) com latência super baixa para reduzir ou eliminar o enjôo de movimento em uma tela 1200x1800 por olho para qualidade HD.<br/><br/>E sim, os Macs são muito usados para renderização de vídeo, mas essa renderização não acontece em 30 + fps. Pode levar horas para renderizar um único quadro e às vezes anos para renderizar um filme inteiro. O produto final, ou material pré-renderizado, é o que então se torna 30+fps.<br/><br/>Obrigado @TheRealFixxer<br/>Muito do que você diz faz sentido e alguns que eu não sabia.<br/><br/>Eu acho que eu não vejo VR como um jogo, mas como uma imersão e vendo Macs são bons em 3dcad e compilação de vídeo eu acho que eles seriam capazes de compilar uma cena bem. Eu até vi renders 3d de filme caminhar. Criando um mundo 3D e colocando câmeras em áreas para descobrir como uma cena ficaria<br/><br/>Mas eu concordo Mac fazer mais uso de ciclos de CPU, mesmo usando lá GPUs para ajudar. Com isso disse que há outras direções que se poderia levá-lo. Como placas de vídeo externas Thunderbolt.<br/><br/>Meu grande aperto é o fato de que Octulas é visto como um produto de consumo. Se os requisitos são tão altos, então é mais um produto profissional e precisa ser anunciado como tal. Entendo que a tecnologia está lá, mas não sinto que esteja lá para chamá-la de produto de consumo.<br/><br/>Sim, você está certo. A Apple também tem problemas com o software. A maioria não está usando "metal" a linguagem de programação apple que acelera o processamento para jogos, porque é uma solução da Apple apenas onde muitos usam motores de jogos que funcionam no Microsoft Direct X ou OpenGL de código aberto que a maioria dos jogos usam para rodar no Linux e oSX. Opengl é cerca de 20% mais lento e, às vezes, muito mais do que isso em comparação com x direto, então um cartão de jogo de topo da linha rodando no oSX é tão rápido quanto um cartão de jogo de nível médio nas janelas. Tão grandes problemas para não mencionar a maioria dos macs têm construído em cartões que não têm capacidade de atualização.<br/><br/>O mac pro é tão diferente que a Apple teria que fazer isso, pois não valeria a pena um fornecedor de cartão fazendo isso, pois não há lucro para eles com a pequena quantidade de possíveis compradores que haveria para isso. A Apple não gosta de perder dinheiro, então eu não vejo isso acontecer. A Apple perderia dinheiro oferecendo upgrades de placas de vídeo para mac pros.<br/><br/>Bem, ele tem um ponto embora eu não me importe com oculus rift, em vez de esperar por starVR. Deve haver uma opção para adicionar melhores GPUs em um iMac e MacBook Pro. Também é triste que não haja mais cartão nVidia, gostei do suporte CUDA agora vou ter que comprar um PC e instalar o Linux para meus projetos CUDA.<br/><br/>Os jogos são um mercado em crescimento e não demorará muito até que até mesmo os iPhones tenham mais desempenho de GPU do que os Macs. Concordo que a Apple deve oferecer uma GPU de ponta em um Mac<br/><br/>Estou muito incomodado com a falta de gráficos discretos de alto desempenho em computadores Mac. Mesmo o topo do iMac usa uma GPU móvel desatualizada que, é claro, não pode ser atualizada. Se eu quero desenvolver software para VR, a Apple não me deixou escolha a não ser comprar ou construir um PC para executá-lo. Como um grande fã da Apple (sim, eu admito) isso me deixa bastante triste.<br/><br/>BTW, VR não é uma moda passageira. Se você já tentou, você sabe o que eu quero dizer. VR vai mudar a criação de jogos e conteúdo para sempre. Minha única preocupação com VR é que é muito bom. Pode haver milhões de pessoas que se tornarão viciadas em viver e jogar em mundos virtuais. Veja quantas pessoas ficaram viciadas em MMOs que jogaram em uma tela plana. Com VR você realmente se sente como se estivesse no jogo.<br/><br/>Não se preocupe com nada, tenho certeza de que a apple terá sua própria implementação para Mac e iOS quando a tecnologia estiver pronta para os consumidores, agora é mais para usuários hardcore. Como sempre, a maçã gosta de cronometrar sua presença no momento certo, com o produto certo. Tenha fé na maçã.<br/><br/>É engraçado que muitas pessoas saibam qual vr é melhor com base no suporte ao sistema operacional. Eu acho que vocês fizeram testes pesados e agora são o cara na grande loja de eletrônicos que sabe melhor.<br/><br/>A HTC disse que trará suporte para o OSX, mas isso ainda precisa ser visto.<br/><br/>Eu entendo que muitos de vocês estão estampados lá d**ks. Mas entenda que a Apple está mais focada em laptops. E laptops não podem ser embalados com mais energia do que um PC, devido ao tamanho, calor, consumo de energia etc.<br/><br/>Ele está certo, mesmo que ele colocou em termos ****. Eu amo o meu Mac, mas Deus precisa de um impulso em gráficos. Não que precise custar mais, mas eu estaria mais do que disposto a pagar um pouco mais por uma melhor placa gráfica ou pelo menos ter a opção de instalar a minha própria. É realmente uma pena que este cara teve que fazer sua declaração soar como ele é simplesmente inculto. |

| What Guys Said 19<br/><br/>No, it is because entertainment producers and product marketers want actors/actresses and models who look like the majority of the audience, so that they are relatable and therefore more effective sales tools. I am sure that Asian women look wonderful to Asian men. To me, as a white man, they have zero appeal.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 I am 100 per cent straight. I do not go outside of my race. When I was a soldier I had the "me love you long time" experience in Asia. That has left me feeling uncomfortable whenever there are Asian females near me. Sometimes I become profoundly uncomfortable, even though the particular individuals have done nothing to merit it. During a visit to Thailand, I found that the only way to prevent myself being propositioned on the street was to take white a female with me as a minder.<br/><br/>Aha the thing is that there isn't many white people (or any at all) in China, but in 'white' places, (or at least Australia) there are quite a lot of Asians around there, which made me think about this question...<br/><br/>Maybe in parts of the country where you stick at (remember, birds of a feather...), just like to republicans it seems that most people are republican etc. While it can only be small minority that you are surrounded by.<br/><br/>And as far as I know, there are a lot of whites in china, mainly by business, etc. But it's simple, most of people there are Asian, so they prefere Asian girls (dogs like dogs , cats like cats, most people prefere their own kind). And there is nothing wrong with that. Same is in white countries.<br/><br/>I think Asians are the most beautful. Unfortunately for me the 2 I got involved with in my life one was using me for my place/internet a long time ago and the recent one was a gold digging stupid bitch. She never graduated college and was 30. I would be extremely happy if I met a smart cute Asian woman near my age that was not a gold digger.<br/><br/>@Prettyapathetic yes because when a man loves deeply he always good with you on bed no matter size of tits or colour of skin and a real man always respect a girl in every relation like mother, sister, wife, girlfriend etc<br/><br/>as a model from childhood I got my start with a company called sugar & spice. I was recruited in Japan while my family was stationed there.<br/><br/>you get a job because they are going for a certain look, who are they targeting, and the area you live in.<br/><br/>I had to leave the industry last year because of health reasons. I worked with with many types of people, korean, Japanese, chinese, polish, german, American, Spanish, arabic. I've worked with children, adults, teenagers all of these ethnicities.<br/><br/>I am half white half Native American (Lakota) so they loved my look from a young age. but there are many beauty standards in the industry and not all of them are as portrayed, some being made to look worse, and some not taken seriously enough...<br/><br/>Nope, it's because the Asian men are jealous and angry and invent thousands of excuses every rare time who have Asian women in the media because they are jealous of Asian women, and Americans want to keep the status of white women, this is why the couples between Asian women and white men are boycotted and all other race with white women are pushed, it's white women wiht white men and white women with other races in American media, since it's opression and offensive for the ego of men of other race the women of own race with white but white women with other race is "anti-racism". You need to understand the American political social engineering all over these years of media, democrats, politics and propaganda.<br/><br/>Anyway, in countries like china, japan, korea they have Asian men and Asian women only and the only exceptions are when they import a white women to make some fantasy scene for them but it's not so much, it's forbiden expose the hatred and jealousy of some Asian men.<br/><br/>The Asian boys will be happy if you say something against other men, but they will be angry if you say that the Asian girl will die for the blond girl date the handsome caucasian/white dude, they will try to force Asian women to make anything against these men to these small vocal group of Asian men feel better in their hatred, excuses, racism and jealousy. This is why Asian women is not showed so much, it's because the Asian men will be angry, it's because the white women can't be replaced, and the American propaganda is around white women with white men, white women with other race, white women against white men for the other race of men, white women in everything.<br/><br/>1<br/><br/>1&#124;0<br/><br/>0&#124;0<br/><br/>Opinion Owner<br/><br/>1mo<br/><br/>All the excuses of media and propaganda and all lies for racism, jealousy and hate aren't used against white women by the same men who invent the excuses, white women all the time in the media, understand, the American social engineering is made by democrats, democrats hate white men, and the most popular couples would be white men and Asian women but it's horrible for a few group of white racists who are racists even against Asians, is bad for the angry Asian men and their excuses, is bad for the white women, the democrats really don't like white men and work hard to try to make the couple and anything wiht white men and non-white women be related to bad things while pushing white women and non-white men. It's a American political problem.<br/><br/>I think it's a opression against the ego of the men of other race, so the white guys need to look bad, be some sort of jokes, be soft, while the scenes with white women and other race is the opposite of the scenes of white men and non-white women | O que os homens disseram 19<br/><br/>Não, é porque os produtores de entretenimento e os profissionais de marketing de produtos querem atores / atrizes e modelos que se parecem com a maioria do público, para que sejam ferramentas de vendas mais confiáveis e, portanto, mais eficazes. Tenho certeza que as mulheres asiáticas parecem maravilhosas para os homens asiáticos. Para mim, como um homem branco, eles têm zero apelo.<br/><br/>@cowboy101 Eu sou 100% heterossexual. Eu não saio da minha raça. Quando eu era um soldado eu tive a experiência "eu te amo há muito tempo" na Ásia. Isso me deixou desconfortável sempre que há mulheres asiáticas perto de mim. Às vezes fico profundamente desconfortável, mesmo que os indivíduos em particular não tenham feito nada para merecê-lo. Durante uma visita à Tailândia, descobri que a única maneira de evitar que eu fosse proposta na rua era levar uma fêmea branca comigo como uma minder.<br/><br/>Ah, a coisa é que não há muitas pessoas brancas (ou nenhuma) na China, mas em lugares 'brancos', (ou pelo menos na Austrália) há um monte de asiáticos por aí, o que me fez pensar sobre essa questão...<br/><br/>Talvez em partes do país onde você fica (lembre-se, pássaros de penas...), assim como os republicanos, parece que a maioria das pessoas é republicana, etc. Embora possa ser apenas uma pequena minoria que você está cercado.<br/><br/>E até onde eu sei, há muitos brancos na China, principalmente por negócios, etc. Mas é simples, a maioria das pessoas lá são asiáticas, então eles preferem meninas asiáticas (cães como cães, gatos como gatos, a maioria das pessoas prefere sua própria espécie). E não há nada de errado nisso. O mesmo acontece nos países brancos.<br/><br/>Eu acho que os asiáticos são os mais bonitos. Infelizmente para mim os 2 eu me envolvi com na minha vida um estava me usando para o meu lugar / internet há muito tempo e o recente foi uma vadia estúpida de escavação de ouro. Ela nunca se formou na faculdade e tinha 30 anos. Eu ficaria extremamente feliz se eu conhecesse uma mulher asiática inteligente e fofa perto da minha idade que não fosse uma escavadora de ouro.<br/><br/>@Prettypathetic sim, porque quando um homem ama profundamente ele sempre é bom com você na cama, não importa o tamanho dos seios ou a cor da pele e um homem de verdade sempre respeitar uma menina em todas as relações como mãe, irmã, esposa, namorada etc<br/><br/>como modelo desde a infância eu comecei com uma empresa chamada açúcar e especiarias. Fui recrutado no Japão enquanto minha família estava estacionada lá.<br/><br/>você consegue um emprego porque eles estão indo para um certo olhar, quem eles estão visando, e a área em que você vive.<br/><br/>Eu tive que deixar a indústria no ano passado por razões de saúde. Eu trabalhei com muitos tipos de pessoas, coreano, japonês, chinês, polonês, alemão, americano, espanhol, árabe. Eu trabalhei com crianças, adultos, adolescentes todas essas etnias.<br/><br/>Eu sou meio branco meio nativo americano (Lakota) então eles adoraram meu olhar desde uma idade jovem. mas há muitos padrões de beleza na indústria e nem todos eles são tão retratados, alguns sendo feitos para parecer pior, e alguns não levados a sério o suficiente...<br/><br/>Não, é porque os homens asiáticos são brancos ciumento e irritado e inventar milhares de desculpas cada vez raro que têm mulheres asiáticas na mídia porque eles são ciumento de mulheres asiáticas, e os americanos querem manter o status de mulheres brancas, é por isso que os casais entre mulheres asiáticas e homens brancos são boicotados e todas as outras raças com mulheres brancas são ofensivos. Você precisa entender a engenharia social política americana ao longo desses anos de mídia, democratas, política e propaganda.<br/><br/>De qualquer forma, em países como China, Japão, Coréia eles têm homens asiáticos e mulheres asiáticas apenas e as únicas exceções são quando eles importam uma mulher branca para fazer alguma cena de fantasia para eles, mas não é tanto, é proibido expor o ódio e o ciúme de alguns homens asiáticos.<br/><br/>Os meninos asiáticos ficarão felizes se você disser algo contra outros homens, mas eles ficarão com raiva se você disser que a garota asiática morrerá pela garota loira namorando o belo cara caucasiano / branco, eles tentarão forçar as mulheres asiáticas a fazer qualquer coisa contra esses homens para que esses pequenos grupos vocais de homens asiáticos se sintam melhor em seu ódio, desculpas, racismo e ciúmes. É por isso que as mulheres asiáticas não são mostradas tanto, é porque os homens asiáticos ficarão com raiva, é porque as mulheres brancas não podem ser substituídas, e a propaganda americana está em torno de mulheres brancas com homens brancos, mulheres brancas com outra raça, mulheres brancas contra homens brancos para a outra raça de homens, mulheres brancas em tudo.<br/><br/>1o<br/><br/>1&#124;0<br/><br/>0&#124;0<br/><br/>Opinion Owner<br/><br/>1mo<br/><br/>Todas as desculpas da mídia e da propaganda branca e todas as mentiras para o racismo, o ciúme e o ódio não são usados contra as mulheres brancas pelos mesmos homens que inventam as desculpas, as mulheres brancas o tempo todo na mídia, entendem, a engenharia social americana é feita por democratas, os democratas odeiam homens brancos, e os casais mais populares seriam homens brancos e mulheres asiáticas, mas é horrrível para alguns homens brancos. É um problema político americano.<br/><br/>Eu acho que é uma opressão contra o ego dos homens de outra raça, então os caras brancos precisam parecer ruins, ser algum tipo de piada, ser macios, enquanto as cenas com mulheres brancas e outras raças são o oposto das cenas de homens brancos e mulheres não brancas. |
