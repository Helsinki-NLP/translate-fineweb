| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Embora reconheça que é impossível argumentar que alguém ama algo que odeia, e vice-versa, ainda é muitas vezes agradável tentar o argumento. Quando falamos com pessoas cujas opiniões contradizem diretamente as nossas, somos forçados a defender nossos gostos, definir nossas opiniões e analisar por que reagimos da maneira que fazemos. É por isso que temos Why Don't You Like This?, em que dois de nossos funcionários tentarão descobrir se as pessoas com opiniões opostas podem ir além do "Não, você está errado!" e ter uma discussão civil, construtiva e possivelmente até convincente sobre seus pontos de discórdia. Porque não importa o que o rádio de conversação diga, ainda há um meio termo entre "Nós concordamos totalmente" e "Eu estou certo, e você é estúpido e malvado".<br/><br/>Scott: Desde que discutimos minha apostasia Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World, temos procurado um caso em que eu possa chamá-lo por não gostar de algo maravilhoso, e não tivemos que procurar por muito tempo. Estávamos sentados um ao lado do outro durante o Hugo de Martin Scorsese – eu, totalmente encantado por sua fantástica homenagem às maravilhas do cinema mudo primitivo, e você, aparentemente resistindo a ele em todos os momentos. O consenso crítico tem estado do meu lado: ele atingiu o número 9 no nosso coletivo Top 15 (embora você o tenha listado como sua escolha superestimada), ganhou (ou colocado) em vários prêmios de crítica de filmes e atualmente desfruta de uma pontuação de 83 no Metacritic. Isso não significa que você esteja errado, é claro, mas cabe a você explicar por que Hugo era, em suas palavras, "oco e artificial", onde muitos de nós o viam como uma encantadora evocação da infância de Scorsese e do meio quando ele ainda estava em sua infância. E, por favor, seja gentil ao rasgar esta borboleta pelas asas.<br/><br/>Anúncios<br/><br/>Tasha: Eu não posso ser gentil, Scott. Às vezes dói menos se você rasgar o Band-Aid de uma só vez. (E mesmo que não, quem quer andar vestindo um Band-Aid meio rasgado? Gross.) O fato é que achei que Hugo era um exercício de manipulação cansativa na falsificação, a partir de seu deslizamento de abertura através de uma estação de trem em Paris, o que me fez lembrar mais do que qualquer coisa do The Polar Express de Robert Zemeckis. Ao contrário de Mike D'Angelo, sou um fã de longas e ininterruptas tomadas como uma maneira de estabelecer um espaço e encorajar os espectadores a segurar inconscientemente suas respirações enquanto uma câmera explora uma área; mas quando o espaço que está sendo explorado é uma criação CGI lisa e brilhante, e a câmera flutua sem peso através dele, sem sentido físico de que a câmera ou o ambiente estão realmente lá, essa exploração começa a se sentir como um jogo. E o resto do filme me pareceu igualmente poroso e irreal, tanto em termos de cenário quanto em termos de sua história altamente artificial.<br/><br/>Eu não tenho necessariamente um problema com ambientes fabricados e estilizados no cinema. Eu amei a versão de Baz Luhrmann de Paris no Moulin Rouge, por exemplo, mas esse filme tem um senso de ridículo, um senso de humor sobre o quão deliberadamente exagerado é. Assim como a estilização de Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularmente em Amélie. (Ambos Jeunet e Luhrmann sentiram fortes influências visuais aqui.) Eu tive a sensação, no entanto, que Martin Scorsese queria que eu levasse Hugo completamente a sério. Apesar de ser mais uma história sentimental sobre um órfão corajoso trazendo cor de volta à vida de um velho mal-humorado.<br/><br/>Anúncios<br/><br/>Não há nada que eu goste mais no cinema do que ser surpreendido. E não há nada que eu resista mais do que ser manipulado abertamente, sendo dito em voz alta o que sentir e quando senti-lo. Um bom filme faz esse tipo de coisa sutilmente; um mau usa pistas musicais e cordas doces - e, neste caso, um órfão sujo, de olhos enormes e despedaçado olhando para a câmera - para exigir pathos e dizer aos espectadores que são pessoas horríveis se não servirem sob demanda. Dito isto, eu posso lidar com crianças tristes e adultos mal-humorados fazendo a vida melhor um para o outro – eu realmente cavei o Le Havre deste ano, que era essencialmente o mesmo enredo sem toda a graça – mas eu acho que os ambientes artificiais refletem mal sobre as emoções artificiais, e cada um faz o outro parecer mais falso por turnos.<br/><br/>Vamos começar com isso. No nosso vídeo de filmes esquecidos, vocês e Noel levaram Keith para a tarefa de defender o Tiranossauro, porque você sentiu que não era realista o suficiente - muito artificial, muito miserável, muito, muito longe. Como é possível que você não possa comprar um velho maníaco que quebra as coisas quando ele está com raiva, mas você pode comprar um órfão que vive dentro de um relógio gigante da estação de trem e embarcar em uma jornada caprichosa para reparar um autômato misterioso que ele acredita que pode ter segredos de seu pai morto, mas que, em vez disso, o leva em uma viagem peculiar de auto-descoberta, no cinema mágico? Você nunca encontrou o design rococó ousado de Hugo, agressivos arrancadores de cordas cardíacas ou carrinhos de mão cheios de peculiaridades, mesmo que um pouco excessivas ou difíceis de engolir?<br/><br/>Anúncios<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet e Luhrmann como influências em Scorsese?! Esqueça ser indelicado, agora você está deliberadamente me cutucando com uma vara afiada. Se você está procurando inspirações para Hugo – na verdade, se você está procurando o núcleo emocional de Hugo – você tem que voltar à infância de Scorsese na Elizabeth Street, na Little Italy, onde um menino asmático, incapaz de brincar com as outras crianças, se retirou para fantasias de Alexander Korda como The Thief Of Bagdad. Ou, mais simplesmente, vá direto à fonte: George Méliès, cuja Viagem à Lua continua a ser o Big Bang de todas as fantasias cinematográficas, aquele momento em que a câmera não foi usada para documentar o mundo como ele é, mas qualquer lugar caprichoso, mágico, transportador que um cineasta queira inventar para ele. E essa tradição foi desenvolvida e expandida por décadas antes de pessoas como Jeunet e Luhrmann colocarem suas patinhas sujas nela.<br/><br/>E falando de Jeunet, boa tentativa de tirar minha arma retórica, mas vou dizer de qualquer maneira: como você pode amar Amélie, mas achar Hugo sintético e "excessivo" e "cansantemente manipulador"? Você diz que Amélie e Moulin Rouge têm um "sentido de ridículo" onde Scorsese quer dizer que devemos levar Hugo a sério, e eu não acho que esse seja o caso, pelo menos no último ponto. Que Scorsese sinta uma paixão evidente pelos filmes é, suponho, por que você interpreta Hugo como auto-sério. Mas para mim, são esses sentimentos que dão ao filme um lastro emocional que os filmes de Luhrmann e Jeunet não têm. Todos os três filmes fazem uso agressivo das maravilhas do CGI – e Scorsese adiciona 3D à mistura, para um efeito maravilhoso – mas onde você e eu diferimos é na questão da ausência de peso. Eu concordo que o CGI tem um efeito de distanciamento; mundos compostos inteiramente de plastilina digital são flexíveis até o ponto em que às vezes não têm presença. Você se referiu a Hugo em sua entrada "Overrated" para a nossa peça Best Of Film como "um gimcrack CGI" - uma dis perfeita ... para outro filme.<br/><br/>Anúncios<br/><br/>É justo dizer que Scorsese construiu Hugo em torno de um enredo de livro / filme infantil de edição padrão: Orphan sente falta de seu pai, cria seu próprio pequeno mundo de fantasia, brilha em um novo amigo, convence um velho fuddy-duddy crocante a suavizar e talvez adotá-lo. Mas esse é apenas o esqueleto narrativo, e Scorsese fornece muita carne e sangue. Por um lado, você não pode assistir Hugo, o garoto solitário, olhando para fora das torres do relógio para a agitação de uma estação de trem de Paris sem pensar em Scorsese, outro garoto solitário, olhando pela janela de seu quarto na Elizabeth Street. E mesmo que você não seja um nerd grande o suficiente para fazer essa conexão, eu realmente sinto que a jornada de Hugo não está em encontrar uma nova figura paterna, mas em persistir com a magia mecânica que permanece como o legado de seu próprio pai. A persistência da visão que nos permite aceitar uma versão ilusória do mundo a 24 quadros por segundo é ciência e magia ao mesmo tempo. O relacionamento de Hugo com Méliès não é sobre ele aconchegar-se com um novo pai, mas compartilhar um entusiasmo comum que o velhote submergiu em amargura. Para mim, esse é um ângulo muito mais único em uma premissa potencialmente desgastada.<br/><br/>Até mesmo os poucos detratores do filme parecem dispostos a admitir que as sequências que evocam a história do cinema e o estúdio de Méliès – com Michael Stuhlbarg como o heroico estudioso de cinema! – foram fantásticas. Sentiu-se, da melhor maneira possível, como uma compressão inebriante da minha aula de História do Filme 101 na faculdade, condensando o valor de um semestre de clipes e contexto em algo entre uma montagem e um livro pop-up animado. E fala sobre o design engenhoso do filme, que combina fatos e fantasias tão lindamente que é ao mesmo tempo uma história de Méliès e o nascimento do cinema, e apenas o tipo de maravilha cinematográfica simples e sumptuosamente produzida que o próprio Scorsese teria amado quando criança. Graças a Deus, Hugo não segue o modelo Jeunet / Luhrmann e tem "um senso de sua própria ridicularidade". Como um conhecedor de fantasia você mesmo, você não diria que há valor em jogá-lo direto e sério e desvergonhado ao invés de piscar para o público? Você pode achar Hugo doentiamente doce, mas eu não acho que a autenticidade de seu sentimento seja negada.<br/><br/>Anúncios<br/><br/>Tasha: Sim, eu realmente encontrei partes de Hugo encantadoras. (Note como eu estou respondendo à sua pergunta na frente, enquanto você estava muito ocupado espumando com a apoplexia para abordar a minha, embora eu suponha que seja uma resposta em seu próprio direito. Ok, "influência" pode estar exagerando o caso - eu só quis dizer que o estilo visual parecia muito familiar. Embora, como Keith apontou quando você mencionou isso pessoalmente, Scorsese não se opõe a se inspirar nos visuais de outras pessoas, nem é imune a isso.) Principalmente, fiquei encantado com as partes que lidam com a história de Georges Méliès, com seu amor pelo cinema, com o trabalho que ele colocou em sua arte e a alegria que ele tirou dela. Há muita beleza e diversão na encenação da cena subaquática de "Fairyland" de Méliès e na sequência no final, com foco nas filmagens de Méliès. Garanto-lhe que a ligação do Hugo com a Méliès por um amor partilhado pelo cinema é um toque agradável, e eu gosto de um bom filme sobre cinema.<br/><br/>Mas Hugo não é principalmente sobre cinema, apesar dos laços de Méliès. Além dos temas que você cita, também é sobre encontrar seu propósito, como os personagens expressamente, laboriosamente explicam uns aos outros e a nós. E é sobre espetáculo, e grandes peças de ação, e perseguições, e finais felizes para sempre, onde até mesmo o valentão irritado e o casal mais velho tímido e fergawdsakes até o texugo irritado todos se emparelham com interesses amorosos encantadores no final. É sobre a super-precoz Hermione Granger ser mandona e alegre e inteligente e elogiar os mundos mágicos envoltos em livros. E todo este negócio é muito familiar, e muito artificial.<br/><br/>Anúncios<br/><br/>Sim, Scorsese está brincando com arquétipos. O problema é que eu nunca senti que ele os imbuía de algo novo, fresco ou crível, apesar de sua própria história. Eu teria preferido uma história sobre um jovem Scorsese crescendo com asma – algo de pequena escala e real, sem grandes salas cheias de relógios CGI e sonhos proféticos e um tirano adulto furioso com um coração de ouro – tudo isso sem sentido. Você continua citando o histórico pessoal de Scorsese e seu amor pelo cinema como evidência de que ele está realmente sentindo o que está colocando na tela, mas eu não sinto seu toque pessoal em nada disso, exceto nos momentos que são expressamente sobre o cinema. As emoções centrais podem ser reais, mas isso não torna a execução menos falsa.<br/><br/>Você diz que a autenticidade da emoção não pode ser negada. Não questiono se Scorsese se sentia sozinho e isolado quando criança, mas não sinto solidão e isolamento na tela – vejo um monte de significados exagerados (Hugo está sujo e suas roupas estão vestidas e todos os adultos gritam com ele e ele é regularmente perseguido por um cão assustador!) e grandes batidas, com gritos e choros de Spielingberg. Para mim, a sinceridade é mais convincente e mais pessoal quando é quieta e direta; quando alguém está gritando suas opiniões para mim, eu suponho que ele está realmente com raiva, ou apenas tentando sobrecarregar meus sentidos para me impedir de expressar minha própria opinião. Hugo foi um longo grito, no que me diz respeito.<br/><br/>Anúncios<br/><br/>Por que Amélie não me deu essa sensação de falsificação? Reconheço completamente que Amélie e Moulin Rouge são construções grandes, manipuladoras e artificiais na mesma veia, exigindo emoções específicas em intervalos específicos e tentando vender essas emoções com emoção pesada e estímulo agressivo da trilha sonora. Nenhum deles realmente me vendeu em suas emoções como sentimento humano autêntico. O que eu gostei nesses dois filmes foi a construção – particularmente as listas inebriantes e ridículas de Amélie de características aleatórias e experiências para o elenco, e os mashups e recontextualizações do Moulin Rouge. Muitas vezes sou vendido em histórias que fazem coisas criativas ou ambiciosas com estrutura, e ambos os filmes se qualificam, onde Hugo é uma busca infantil muito mais linear e padrão.<br/><br/>Mas no final, para mim, realmente se resume a um sentimento de que esses filmes são bobos, enquanto Hugo deve ser levado a sério a cada momento traiçoeiro. Você não acha que isso é verdade - mas você está simultaneamente defendendo sua integridade em termos de sua emoção absolutamente autêntica, enraizada na história do Scorsese, e me dizendo que estou errado, e ele não quer dizer que seja levado a sério. Como você concilia essas duas afirmações? O que o filme sugere a você que não é suposto ser tomado no valor nominal? E é possível que isso seja apenas mais um caso curioso de Benjamin Button, onde eu acho que o uso de crianças em filmes de grande orçamento é em grande parte melodramático e melodramático, enquanto você, como pai, acha que ignora seu cinismo e vai direto para o seu sentimento familiar?<br/><br/>Anúncios<br/><br/>Scott: Não sei se quis dizer que Scorsese não quer ser levado a sério; é apenas que ele escolheu um veículo caprichoso através do qual expressar um amor sério pelos filmes. Quando você diz: "Mas Hugo não é principalmente sobre cinema, apesar dos laços de Méliès", estou perplexo. Eu concedo que você encontre muitos elementos de Hugo excessivamente familiares e laboriosos e cheios de Spielbergian maravilha-emocionante - não há nada que eu possa fazer para argumentar em torno dessa percepção, que outros duvidadores de Hugo compartilham. Às vezes, um filme significa encantar e encantar, e não para alguns; você tem Hugo e eu tenho Amélie, embora eu pense que o último, deliberadamente artificial como é, significa para nós encontrá-lo romântico. (Em vez de, digamos, alguma engenhoca mecânica horrível para uma sequência de Saw.)<br/><br/>Mas dizer que Hugo não é principalmente sobre cinema? Se não é sobre cinema, então é a história discursiva mais inútil sobre [o que você acha que é] que eu já vi. A relação entre Hugo e Méliès é o coração do filme, e no coração disso não é apenas uma conexão entre Plucky Orphan e Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, mas uma afinidade compartilhada pela magia projetada – especificamente a magia dos filmes. Acho que Scorsese e seus colaboradores encontraram uma maneira de expressar seu entusiasmo pelos primeiros dias do cinema através de uma fantasia que é acessível a todas as idades. O conto infantil cheio de arquétipos é apenas a crosta aqui; o cinema é a torta. (Mmmm... torta.)<br/><br/>Anúncios<br/><br/>Quanto ao The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, eu não vejo muita conexão, além de tentar me expor como um defensor de Benjamin Button como uma maneira de prejudicar minha credibilidade. (A propósito, como são os extras naquele G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) Eu já te disse que o novo pai em mim, sem sono, talvez fosse vulnerável a Benjamin Button, mas não consigo imaginar um momento em que a premissa de envelhecer ao contrário não me movesse. E além disso, não vejo como Benjamin Button se relaciona muito com Hugo como um filme sobre crianças, já que isso é apenas um pequeno segmento de uma história que abrange uma trajetória muito maior.<br/><br/>Então eu convenci você? Provavelmente não. Mas estou feliz em saber que Hugo não estava completamente desprovido de encantos para você. As sequências sobre Méliès, o cineasta, são o que colocou Hugo sobre mim – e nisso, pelo menos, podemos compartilhar um pouco de amor pelo cinema.<br/><br/>Anúncios<br/><br/>Tasha: Não, eu não posso dizer que você me convenceu, mais do que eu te convenci. É impossível argumentar com alguém em um amor visceral de qualquer coisa, e realmente deveria ser igualmente impossível falar com alguém para baixo do amor visceral. Principalmente, você me deixou ver Hugo em Scott-O-Vision, que é uma experiência interessante; pelo menos agora estou levemente convencido de que de alguma forma não conseguimos ver filmes completamente diferentes que de alguma forma tinham o mesmo nome e diretor.<br/><br/>Nós certamente tivemos experiências diferentes, no entanto, e na minha opinião, focado em diferentes aspectos da produção: Eu ainda não vejo o "filme é maravilhoso" tema como a única vertente do filme, tanto quanto um entre muitos. "Inutilmente discursivo" quase o cobre, embora eu jogue "muitas vezes desnecessariamente fofo e precioso" em cima disso. Enquanto você está focado no saboroso recheio de torta do filme, sinto que essa torta estava coberta com um quilo de açúcar cristalizado, e acho que isso faz a diferença, independentemente da mensagem central do filme ou de um punhado de cenas fantásticas. Veja também Benjamin Button, que eu não mencionei apenas para te irritar – eu realmente acho que você tem mais um toque sentimental do que eu em relação às crianças no cinema, especialmente quando elas são usadas mais como símbolos de vulnerabilidade e inocência do que como personagens humanos. Ei, você sabe que filme totalmente não tem bonecos de olhos largos bonitos trazendo esperança para um mundo cínico? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Talvez eu vá assistir esses extras em Blu-ray. Eu poderia usar alguma insulina de explosão para compensar a doçura de Hugo. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | "Eu esperava que minha filha fosse livre de tempos difíceis e problemáticos": a história de Mee Mee como uma mãe refugiada<br/><br/>Esperança em tempos de crise: a história do dia das mães<br/><br/>Por Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee ouviu que os soldados estavam vindo. Ela se apoderou de seu filho e freneticamente se juntou ao resto dos aldeões que estavam correndo em direção à fronteira tailandesa-birmanesa, onde o Escritório do Alto Comissariado das Nações Unidas para os Refugiados (ACNUR) estava localizado. Seu marido estava em outra aldeia correndo na direção oposta, Mee mais tarde soube. Depois que a perseguição dos soldados terminou, Mee voltou para casa em sua pequena aldeia em Koechi, Birmânia.<br/><br/>Durante 1997-2000, Mee e milhares como ela viveram sob a constante ameaça de violência dos soldados birmaneses. Muitas pessoas se refugiavam temporariamente na selva e voltavam para casa depois que os soldados deixaram a área, apenas para fazer tudo de novo dias depois. Cerca de uma vez por semana, Mee e outros estavam em movimento para evitar a captura, estupro ou morte por soldados.<br/><br/>Durante um incidente, o marido de Mee correu à frente de sua esposa para garantir comida para sua família. Seu marido foi visto por soldados e baleado. A bala quebrou uma parte de sua caixa torácica, deixando-o gravemente ferido e em angústia enquanto viajava em direção à selva com sua família em busca de segurança.<br/><br/>Por três meses, o marido de Mee se escondeu e mudou a família com uma ferida exasperante ao lado. Ele não recebeu nenhum atendimento médico, exceto o cuidado de Mee.<br/><br/>"Eu tinha medo de voltar para a Birmânia", disse Mee através de um intérprete. "Eu temia morrer. Eu chorei e chorei todos os dias", continuou ela.<br/><br/>O marido de Mee acabou por ter força suficiente para caminhar cinco dias em direção a uma pequena aldeia na Tailândia, onde eles aprenderam a localização de um hospital e um campo de refugiados. Quando Mee e seu marido finalmente chegaram ao hospital, ele foi submetido a uma cirurgia imediata e depois se recuperou.<br/><br/>Símbolo da Esperança<br/><br/>A vida na selva para aqueles que fugiam soldados birmaneses era realmente aterrorizante e difícil. Barracas de bambu improvisadas com apenas coberturas de telhado e piso tornaram-se habitações temporárias adequadas. Muitas mulheres, incluindo Mee, deram à luz crianças na selva. O filho de Mee, então de seis anos, ajudou no parto de sua irmã chamada Eh Ku Hser. Seu nome significa amor – frio – doce. "Frio" na cultura birmanesa significa não passar pelo fogo da vida, pois o calor representa tempos problemáticos.<br/><br/>"Eu esperava que minha filha estivesse livre de tempos difíceis e problemáticos", disse Mee. "Eu não queria que ela passasse pelo que eu tinha experimentado", continuou ela.<br/><br/>Para Mee, o nascimento de sua filha no meio da escuridão, do tormento e do medo, era um símbolo de esperança para uma nova vida por vir. Esperança em tempos de crise, a própria premissa do United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR) recém-co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, é também a essência daquilo sobre o qual as velas lançam luz.<br/><br/>Um novo começo<br/><br/>Com a ajuda do ACNUR, a esperança de uma nova vida realmente se materializou para Mee e sua família quando se estabeleceram em West Springfield, Massachusetts. Lá, Mee conheceu Moo Kho Paw, outra mulher que emigrou da Birmânia, e que estava trabalhando na Prosperity Candle em Florença. A organização ajuda as mulheres refugiadas que escaparam de áreas de conflito a reconstruir suas vidas através da arte de fazer velas. Moo Kho recomendou que Mee se juntasse à organização, e Mee aceitou de bom grado.<br/><br/>"Eu estava animada por estar fora de casa", disse Mee, "Eu fui criada para acreditar que, porque eu era uma mulher, meu papel era ficar em casa e criar minha família". “Enquanto muitas mulheres birmanesas querem fazer mais por si mesmas, elas são muitas vezes encorajadas a permanecerem donas de casa.”<br/><br/>Hoje, Mee tem planos de entrar no negócio de fazer velas para si mesma e sustentar seus cinco filhos, mas ela expressou a necessidade de aprender inglês primeiro.<br/><br/>"No campo de refugiados tailandeses, tínhamos educação, mas não era tão bom", disse Mee. "Quando eu era criança, eu queria ir para a escola, mas me disseram para ficar em casa porque eu era uma mulher. Agora, tenho esperanças de que minhas filhas vão para a faculdade e se tornem médicas ou policiais”, continuou Mee.<br/><br/>Mee encontrou um equilíbrio em sua vida que ela gostaria que outros tivessem encontrado – uma vida simples e feliz, onde o trabalho, cuidar dos membros da família e a liberdade de escolha têm o seu lugar.<br/><br/>Apoio às mulheres refugiadas nos EUA<br/><br/>Compartilhe esta história do Dia das Mães com seus entes queridos.

| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

A ação afirmativa é o resultado do movimento dos Direitos Civis da década de 1960, que surgiu da Lei dos Direitos Civis de 1964, que proibia a discriminação com base na raça, etnia ou gênero. Foi a decisão da Suprema Corte de 1978, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, que permitiu o uso de preferências raciais como um meio de promover a diversidade, permitindo que a ação afirmativa fosse usada nas políticas de admissão. Ele foi criado com a intenção de proporcionar igualdade de oportunidades para os membros de grupos minoritários na educação e no meio do documento.<br/><br/>No entanto, de acordo com um relatório de 2007 do Pew Research Center, o apoio à ação afirmativa entre o público americano aumentou substancialmente nos últimos anos, subindo de 58% em 1995 para 70% em 2007. Os defensores da ação afirmativa fazem muitos argumentos em apoio da ação afirmativa, na esperança de fazer com que os outros vejam o bem genuíno que as políticas de actina afirmativa trazem à nossa sociedade. Os defensores acreditam que a ação afirmativa é mais um processo do que uma política de admissão. As faculdades e universidades tomam a iniciativa extra para alcançar grupos minoritários, incentivando-os a se candidatarem. Faculdades e universidades oferecem ajuda financeira adicional e fornecem recursos no campus para ajudar a melhorar a educação universitária do aluno. Os apoiadores também observam o número crescente de candidaturas de minorias a faculdades e universidades devido, em parte, a políticas de ação afirmativa.<br/>As estatísticas provaram que quando a ação afirmativa é eliminada, como quando foi no Berkley College e na UCLA em 1998, as admissões de estudantes minoritários caíram 61% e 36%, respectivamente, provando que a ação afirmativa desempenha um papel importante em um processo de admissão de estudantes minoritários. Os defensores da ação afirmativa também acreditam que a diversidade no ensino superior proporciona uma melhor atmosfera educacional para todos os alunos, pessoal e intelectualmente. Se a ação afirmativa fosse eliminada, haveria menos estudantes minoritários matriculados em faculdades, fazendo com que a diversidade fosse bastante esguia. As políticas de ação afirmativa também são necessárias para compensar séculos de opressão racial, econômica e social. Indivíduos com um status socioeconômico mais alto têm mais oportunidades do que aqueles de origens socioeconômicas mais baixas. Os defensores acreditam que certos grupos raciais ou étnicos estão desfavorecidos porque freqüentemente estão em lares de baixa renda e, consequentemente, não estão expostos aos mesmos recursos que estudantes de classes socioeconômicas mais altas. Os defensores apoiam a noção de competição entre os alunos com base no mérito, mas argumentam que a ação afirmativa compensa as diferenças econômicas. Os graduados universitários, que se beneficiaram da ação afirmativa, também disseram que receberam melhores empregos, ganharam mais dinheiro e, em geral, vivem melhores vidas por causa das oportunidades afortunadas que receberam através da ação afirmativa.<br/>Os defensores da ação afirmativa enfatizam continuamente a grave importância da ação afirmativa, considerando suas contribuições para melhorar tanto a experiência universitária quanto a sociedade em geral. No entanto, os opositores da ação afirmativa acreditam que chegou a hora de acabar com a ação afirmativa. Os opositores acreditam que a ação afirmativa foi criada para garantir práticas de admissão justas para trazer mudanças para um longo período de discriminação racial.

| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Combinações<br/><br/>Combinações São defesas contra um soco, respostas coreografadas a diferentes tipos de ataques. Eles têm muitos nomes em todas as artes marciais, mas (na minha experiência) cada arte tem uma versão deles. Isso as torna diferentes das formas porque há muitas artes marciais que não têm formas. O que torna os exercícios de parceiros tão universais? Por que praticar uma resposta específica quando (na realidade) o tempo, o tipo de ataque, o tamanho do atacante e uma centena de outros fatores farão com que você nunca use essa resposta coreografada inteira? E, finalmente, como podemos praticar para uma situação de defesa real e evitar lesões ao mesmo tempo?<br/><br/>A universalidade das combinações é impressionante, para dizer o mínimo. Nosso estilo de karatê Kenpo tem uma lista de 108 combos que podem ser aprendidos. (A maioria dos alunos só aprende 20-30 embora) No Jiu-Jitsu brasileiro você passa aulas inteiras praticando barras de braço e estrangulamento, aprendendo todas as sutilezas do movimento enquanto seu parceiro oferece pouca ou nenhuma resistência. Todo boxeador passou horas na frente do saco e / ou espelho jogando a mesma combinação de socos até que seu corpo se mova por reflexo sozinho. As combinações são universais porque não há melhor maneira de introduzir o movimento e, em seguida, praticar as posições sutis necessárias para fazê-las funcionar. Bater em um pequeno ponto de pressão através da roupa leva MUITA prática, pegar uma barra de braço com controle requer um quadril cuidadosamente colocado e uma configuração furtiva, e uma ótima combinação só é útil se você puder atravessá-la de uma posição equilibrada e protegida. Você pode pensar em uma maneira melhor de ganhar essas habilidades?<br/><br/>Há uma série de fatores que determinam como você responde a um ataque e se em uma luta de sparring ou em uma luta, eu NUNCA usei uma combinação completa em minha defesa. Por que, então, passamos horas praticá-los? Praticamos essas respostas coreografadas porque o objetivo não é puxar a combinação 8 para fora toda vez que você vê um soco de gancho, mas para mostrar-lhe uma maneira de bloqueá-lo e, em seguida, uma possível maneira de segui-lo. Eu nunca escolhi usar a combinação 3 em uma situação de realidade, mas o bloco é um dos meus movimentos go-to. Combinações adicionar ferramentas para a caixa de ferramentas que não consertar o carro.<br/><br/>A última pergunta é uma questão de segurança. Se praticamos por causa da realidade, precisamos replicar a realidade. Como evitamos lesões ao fazê-lo? Quando se trata disso, é sobre construir confiança. Começamos devagar e aprendemos a confiar que temos controle sobre nós mesmos. Aprendemos a confiar que nossos parceiros também têm controle. Com mais tempo aprendemos a confiar em nosso controle sobre nosso parceiro e (um pouco mais assustador) aprendemos a confiar no controle de nosso parceiro sobre nós. No final (com muita prática) você pode se mover a toda velocidade, jogando seu parceiro e sendo jogado sem medo de lesões.<br/><br/>As combinações são universais por uma razão; elas são praticadas para que possam ser dissecadas em suas partes, e nós permanecemos seguros começando devagar e construindo confiança. Tal como acontece com tudo nas artes marciais, as combinações têm muitas razões por trás de sua prática e execução. |
