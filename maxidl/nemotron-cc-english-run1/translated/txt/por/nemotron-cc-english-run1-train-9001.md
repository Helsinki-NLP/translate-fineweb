| UNDERSTANDING SELF-EXECUTING TREATIES VIA STATE PRACTICE<br/><br/>Updated: Feb 2<br/><br/>Introduction:<br/><br/>Consider this paradox, when a country ratifies a treaty, it is said to have consented to accept the treaty in its entirety (reservations and declarations being exceptions); but in some cases, the countries go ahead and refuse to adhere to its provisions. For example, Article VI, Clause 2 of the American Constitution has the provisions that "all treaties … shall be the supreme Law of the Land." Although it is evident that treaties on their own do not have the same effect as federal laws. In truth, they only become operational once these provisions come into force as Federal law with Senate and Presidential approval. Although this is the practice, it is a generally accepted principle in international law that certain treaties have a binding effect on countries. The treaty must fulfil the requirement of being a self-executing treaty to affect the country without any corresponding domestic legislature directly.<br/><br/>This raises the question as to which treaty will qualify as "self-executing" and which will not?<br/><br/>Whether a treaty is a self-executing treaty or not is decided by national judges on a case-to-case basis (Buergenthal, 1992). In order to understand this, the paper will first look at the two types of theories followed by countries on the nature of treaties applying to domestic law. These two theories are monism and dualism. They basically view the framework of domestic and international law as a single hierarchy and two separate hierarchies, respectively (Wildhaber, 1971). Countries following monism believe that certain treaties immediately are binding and immediately have an effect on the country. Once the treaty has been ratified, it can be invoked in national courts and is considered to be a part of the law of the country. Countries following dualism believe that a treaty does not affect domestic law until it has been reinforced by a legislature passed in the parliament. An example of dualism is how the European Convention on Human Rights became operational in the United Kingdom after passing the Human Rights Act 1998 in their parliament (Laws, 2000).<br/><br/>International law is diverse, and so are the types of procedures different countries follow for the acceptance of treaties. Some constitutions' themselves mention the procedures for the ratification of a treaty. Some countries even have different treatment given to international treaty law and customary international law. Certain international organizations like the European Union often affect the domestic law of its member states. The member states of the European Union have to give effect to certain forms of community legislature. Although, it has an essential difference from self-executing treaties. The difference is that it is not for national judges to decide whether the provisions are self-executing or not, but rather for the European Court of Justice to interpret under its constitutive treaties. Other forms of international law formed via resolutions or such might not have the same effect for these states. Nevertheless, they might consider them as forms of "soft law" and look into them to interpret the intent of the law. Sometimes, proclamations made by the judicial organs of international organizations such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights affect their member states. Although these proclamations are not binding on the member states, the national judges seem to refer to these for authoritative interpretation.<br/><br/>Therefore, a case-to-case approach must be taken while analyzing the procedures and precedents set in different countries. To examine the concept of self-executing treaties, this paper will compare the precedents set by different jurisdictions. If the reader wishes to conduct a similar analysis, they can do so by looking into the different national yearbooks on international law. Mostly, these yearbooks will have a section devoted to the relationship between international and national law.<br/><br/>International Jurisprudence:<br/><br/>The most significant issue that comes up for national courts is whether the treaty is self-executing? If the treaty can be applied without any additional domestic legislature having passed to reinforce it. This question came up in the case of Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, wherein the Polish Constitutional Court held that since the treaty provisions referred to domestic measures to be taken, the treaty was not self-executing in nature (Bug river claims, Czesław S v State Treasury and Minister of the State Treasury, 2003). Essentially, when the treaty refers to domestic measures to be taken, it does not in itself create new obligations. It instead reinforces the treaty's intent for the domestic legal process to take measures for the same. A similar issue was raised in the Sosa case in the United States of America. In this case, the court considered whether the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights was a self-executing treaty. The American Supreme Court has also declared that the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights is not a self-executing treaty (Court, 2004). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland also examined the self-executing nature of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The issue before the court was whether Article 13(2)(b) and (c) were self-executing in nature. The court examined whether the treaty was partially self-executing and did so by checking whether there existed a minimum core content for the treaty to be applicable. The court held that it found no such provision within the treaty (A and B v Government of the Canton of Zurich, 2000).<br/><br/>It is essential to understand that these issues differ from the fundamental question of whether international law can be applied as part of the law of the land? In order to answer this question, the paper will examine the judgement by the Supreme Court of the Dominican Republic. The Supreme Court stated that Article 3 of the Dominican Republic's Constitution made international law binding on the domestic legal order. The court rejected the Superior Land Court's interpretation that these treaties were "foreign legislature" and not part of the domestic legal order. The Supreme Court laid down that all treaties ratified by the Dominican Republic formed a part of Dominican Law and, therefore, can be termed as self-executing (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción and ors, 1997). The Federal Supreme Court of Switzerland has examined whether the Libson Treaty was self-executing and directly applicable to Swiss Universities. The court held, "According to relevant case law, a treaty norm is directly applicable if its content is sufficiently precise and clear to form the basis of a decision in a particular case. The norm thus has to be justiciable, i.e. define the rights and obligations of an individual and be directed at the competent authorities" (X v University of Lucerne, 2014). This implies that whether the treaty is directly applicable or not, depends upon on whether the norm is justiciable. The Lisbon Treaty is based on the principle of qualifications acquired aboard. This is conveyed through Article IV (1) of the treaty. The purpose of this was to create an obligation for states to show that their decision-making process is fair, transparent and non-discriminatory. The responsibility for proving that the applicant has not met the required criteria is on the "body undertaking the assessment." The treaty guarantees procedural safeguards, which are generally accepted by countries and hence, the court held this treaty to be self-executing. This goes on to showcase the different interpretations undertaken by the courts of various countries.<br/><br/>It is essential to observe whether the norms set out by treaties are actually being complied with. The case laws from various jurisdictions have emphasized that national courts are the final authority on the issue of whether a treaty is self-executing. There is also an inherent duty cast on countries for the observance and due performance of treaties. Such is cast by the Pacta Sunt Servanda rule as enshrined within Article 26 of the Vienna Convention on Law of Treaties (VCLT). Article 27 goes on to reinforce it by stating that international law obligations cannot be ignored by using domestic law as a justification. Many countries' courts have used this as a source of interpretation, such as the Latvian Constitutional Court. In the case of a national norm conflicting with an international norm, the court held that the national norm was null and void. To reach its conclusion, the court strongly relied on the necessary performance of treaties in good faith as envisaged in Article 26 of the VCLT (Linija v Latvia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusion:<br/><br/>From the above, it is clear that treaties have particular requirements before they can be considered self-executing. However, keeping all of these aside, the most important still remains the national courts' interpretation. The national courts decide whether the treaty can be called self-executing or not. Although their Constitution's might contain a provision regarding treaty law being the supreme law of the land, courts from different countries interpret these provisions in different manners. This can be seen as to how the American and Dominican Constitutions' both contain these provisions but follow completely different interpretations of the same. The term "self-executing" may not be congruous for these treaties since, in practice, they still need approval from the national courts. Ideally, the way forward should be that countries acknowledge the self-executing nature of treaties and treat them in a fashion wherein Article 26 and 27 of the VCLT are respected. Again, this is the "ideal" situation and is not likely to find its way into state practice of certain jurisdictions anytime soon. Still, hope can be gained via looking into the interpretations of national courts that respect these norms and hopefully pave the way for other courts to acknowledge this.<br/><br/>References:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Por exemplo, o Artigo VI, Cláusula 2 da Constituição Americana tem as disposições de que "todos os tratados ... serão a lei suprema da terra". Embora seja evidente que os tratados por si só não têm o mesmo efeito que as leis federais. Na verdade, eles só se tornam operacionais uma vez que essas disposições entrem em vigor como lei federal com aprovação do Senado e do Presidente. Embora esta seja a prática, é um princípio geralmente aceito no direito internacional que certos tratados têm um efeito vinculativo sobre os países. O tratado deve cumprir o requisito de ser um tratado auto-executável para afetar o país sem qualquer legislatura doméstica correspondente diretamente.<br/><br/>Isso levanta a questão de qual tratado será qualificado como "auto-executável" e qual não será?<br/><br/>Se um tratado é ou não um tratado auto-executável é decidido pelos juízes nacionais caso a caso (Buergenthal, 1992). Para entender isso, o artigo analisará primeiro os dois tipos de teorias seguidas pelos países sobre a natureza dos tratados que se aplicam ao direito interno. Essas duas teorias são o monismo e o dualismo. Eles basicamente vêem o quadro do direito interno e internacional como uma única hierarquia e duas hierarquias separadas, respectivamente (Wildhaber, 1971). Os países que seguem o monismo acreditam que certos tratados são imediatamente vinculativos e têm um efeito imediato no país. Uma vez ratificado, o tratado pode ser invocado nos tribunais nacionais e é considerado parte da lei do país. Os países que seguem o dualismo acreditam que um tratado não afeta o direito interno até que seja reforçado por uma legislatura aprovada no parlamento. Um exemplo de dualismo é como a Convenção Europeia de Direitos Humanos tornou-se operacional no Reino Unido após a aprovação da Lei de Direitos Humanos de 1998 em seu parlamento (Leis, 2000).<br/><br/>O direito internacional é diversificado, assim como os tipos de procedimentos seguidos pelos diferentes países para a aceitação de tratados. Alguns países têm até mesmo um tratamento diferente dado ao direito internacional convencional e ao direito internacional consuetudinário. Certas organizações internacionais como a União Europeia muitas vezes afetam o direito interno de seus Estados-Membros. Os Estados-Membros da União Europeia têm de dar efeito a certas formas de legislatura comunitária, embora tenha uma diferença essencial em relação aos tratados auto-executivos. A diferença é que não compete aos juízes nacionais decidir se as disposições são auto-executivas ou não, mas sim ao Tribunal de Justiça Europeu interpretar os seus tratados constitutivos. Outras formas de direito internacional formadas através de resoluções ou tais podem não ter o mesmo efeito para esses estados. No entanto, eles podem considerá-los como formas de "lei suave" e olhar para eles para interpretar a intenção da lei. Às vezes, as proclamações feitas pelos órgãos judiciais de organizações internacionais, como a Corte Interamericana de Direitos Humanos, afetam seus Estados membros. Embora estas proclamações não sejam vinculativas para os Estados-Membros, os juízes nacionais parecem recorrer a estas para interpretação autorizada.<br/><br/>Portanto, uma abordagem caso a caso deve ser tomada ao analisar os procedimentos e precedentes estabelecidos em diferentes países. Para examinar o conceito de tratados auto-executáveis, este artigo irá comparar os precedentes estabelecidos por diferentes jurisdições. Se o leitor desejar realizar uma análise semelhante, pode fazê-lo examinando os diferentes anuários nacionais sobre direito internacional. Principalmente, esses anuários terão uma seção dedicada à relação entre direito internacional e nacional.<br/><br/>Jurisprudência internacional:<br/><br/>A questão mais importante que surge para os tribunais nacionais é se o tratado é auto-executável? Se o tratado pode ser aplicado sem que qualquer legislatura interna adicional tenha passado para reforçá-lo. Esta questão surgiu no caso Czesław S v Tesouro do Estado e Ministro do Tesouro do Estado, em que o Tribunal Constitucional polaco considerou que, uma vez que as disposições do tratado se referiam a medidas internas a serem tomadas, o tratado não era de natureza auto-executiva (Bug River Claims, Czesław S v Tesouro do Estado e Ministro do Tesouro do Estado, 2003). Essencialmente, quando o tratado se refere a medidas internas a serem tomadas, não cria em si novas obrigações, mas reforça a intenção do tratado de que o processo legal interno tome medidas para o mesmo. Uma questão semelhante foi levantada no caso Sosa nos Estados Unidos da América. Neste caso, o tribunal considerou se o Pacto Internacional sobre Direitos Civis e Políticos era um tratado auto-executável. A Suprema Corte dos Estados Unidos também declarou que o Pacto Internacional sobre Direitos Civis e Políticos não é um tratado auto-executável (Court, 2004). O Supremo Tribunal Federal da Suíça também examinou a natureza auto-executiva do Pacto Internacional de Direitos Civis e Políticos. A questão perante o tribunal era se o artigo 13.o, n.o 2, alíneas b) e c), era auto-executável por natureza. O tribunal examinou se o tratado era parcialmente auto-executável e fez isso verificando se existia um conteúdo básico mínimo para que o tratado fosse aplicável. O tribunal considerou que não encontrava tal disposição no tratado (A e B c. Governo do Cantão de Zurique, 2000).<br/><br/>É essencial entender que essas questões diferem da questão fundamental de saber se o direito internacional pode ser aplicado como parte do direito da terra? Para responder a essa pergunta, o jornal examinará a sentença do Supremo Tribunal da República Dominicana. O Supremo Tribunal declarou que o artigo 3 da Constituição da República Dominicana tornava o direito internacional vinculativo para a ordem jurídica interna. O tribunal rejeitou a interpretação do Superior Land Court de que esses tratados eram "legislação estrangeira" e não faziam parte da ordem jurídica interna. O Supremo Tribunal determinou que todos os tratados ratificados pela República Dominicana faziam parte do direito dominicano e, portanto, podem ser considerados auto-executivos (Gallardo Montilla v Gallardo Concepción e ors, 1997). O Supremo Tribunal Federal da Suíça examinou se o Tratado de Libson era auto-executável e diretamente aplicável às universidades suíças. De acordo com a jurisprudência relevante, uma norma de tratado é diretamente aplicável se seu conteúdo for suficientemente preciso e claro para formar a base de uma decisão em um caso particular. A norma deve, portanto, ser judiciável, ou seja, definir os direitos e obrigações de um indivíduo e ser dirigida às autoridades competentes” (X v Universidade de Lucerna, 2014). O Tratado de Lisboa baseia-se no princípio das qualificações adquiridas a bordo, que é transmitido através do n.o 1 do artigo IV do Tratado. O objetivo era criar uma obrigação para os Estados de demonstrar que seu processo de tomada de decisão é justo, transparente e não discriminatório. A responsabilidade de provar que o requerente não preencheu os critérios exigidos incumbe ao «organismo que procede à avaliação». O tratado garante salvaguardas processuais, que são geralmente aceites pelos países e, portanto, o tribunal considerou que este tratado é auto-executável. Isto continua a mostrar as diferentes interpretações tomadas pelos tribunais de vários países.<br/><br/>É essencial observar se as normas estabelecidas pelos tratados estão realmente sendo cumpridas. As leis de casos de várias jurisdições enfatizaram que os tribunais nacionais são a autoridade final sobre a questão de saber se um tratado é auto-executável. Há também um dever inerente aos países para a observância e a devida execução dos tratados. Tal é definido pela regra do Pacto Sunt Servanda como consagrado no artigo 26 da Convenção de Viena sobre o Direito dos Tratados (VCLT). O artigo 27.o reforça-o afirmando que as obrigações do direito internacional não podem ser ignoradas com base no direito interno, que os tribunais de muitos países têm utilizado como fonte de interpretação, como o Tribunal Constitucional da Letónia. No caso de uma norma nacional em conflito com uma norma internacional, o tribunal considerou que a norma nacional era nula e sem efeito. Para chegar à sua conclusão, o tribunal baseou-se fortemente na execução necessária dos tratados de boa fé, tal como previsto no artigo 26.o do VCLT (Linija/Letónia, 2004).<br/><br/>Conclusão:<br/><br/>A partir do que precede, é evidente que os tratados têm requisitos particulares antes de poderem ser considerados auto-executáveis. No entanto, deixando de lado todos estes, o mais importante continua a ser a interpretação dos tribunais nacionais. Os tribunais nacionais decidem se o tratado pode ser chamado de auto-executável ou não. Embora a sua Constituição pode conter uma disposição sobre o direito dos tratados sendo a lei suprema da terra, os tribunais de diferentes países interpretam essas disposições de maneiras diferentes. Isso pode ser visto como as Constituições americana e dominicana contêm essas disposições, mas seguem interpretações completamente diferentes das mesmas. O termo "auto-executável" pode não ser congruente para esses tratados, uma vez que, na prática, eles ainda precisam da aprovação dos tribunais nacionais. Idealmente, o caminho a seguir deve ser que os países reconheçam a natureza auto-executiva dos tratados e tratá-los de uma forma em que os artigos 26 e 27 do VCLT são respeitados. Mais uma vez, esta é a situação "ideal" e não é provável que encontre seu caminho na prática estadual de certas jurisdições em breve. Ainda assim, a esperança pode ser ganha através da análise das interpretações dos tribunais nacionais que respeitam essas normas e, esperamos, pavimentar o caminho para que outros tribunais reconheçam isso.<br/><br/>Referências:<br/><br/>Buergenthal, T.

Whether it is a last-minute job request or a paper that you forgot to write and it is due the next day, stress can always find a way into your day if you allow it. Today I will show you a few things you can do to eliminate or prevent stress.<br/><br/>The first thing you can do is to exercise. Exercising is a great way to relieve stress because it lowers the stress hormone in your body known as cortisol. The lower levels of cortisol in your body, the lower your stress level will be. Exercise can also increase your confidence, and when your confidence is up then your stress is usually down. For me, when I get stressed, I always exercise by going to the gym and practice boxing, it helps me burn calories and reduce stress while having fun.<br/><br/>Writing things down has been a way to calm people down for a very long time, and it is the next topic on our list. Writing down what is making you stressed is a way to clear the mind, and it helps get rid of stress as well. I have a similar experience when writing stories, usually if I cannot think of a new idea because of an old one, I will write the old idea down and think on it. That is when new ideas start to spring up and I can continue writing normally. It is the same with stress. Think about a stream it continues to flow down it's path until it hits a beaver dam, and that dam blocks the flow of water and everything starts to build up. The only way to get the water flow back to normal is to remove the dam. This is where writing comes in. When you write it down, you are removing stress piece by piece until you can think normally again.<br/><br/>Stress can come into our lives through doors in our life that we keep open. Procrastination is a way that we can leave the doors open for stress. Waiting until tomorrow may be fun for today, but it will hurt you tomorrow, and is a very short-sighted solution. The longer you wait to do something, the larger that something becomes, and the larger it becomes the more stress you will be inviting into your life. Taking care of something as soon as we receive it is a great way to prevent stress, but it is something that takes great discipline to do. The more you cut Procrastination out of your life, the more stress free you will be. So shut that door, you're letting all the cold air out.<br/><br/>So let's review: Exercise, Write down what is stressing you, and Do not Procrastinate. These are only a few ways to relieve stress but to me, they are the most effective. While I know these may not work for everyone I would like to invite anyone feeling stressed to research how to get rid of it. | BLOGS<br/><br/>Confira nossa coleção de blogs escritos por colegas de equipe.<br/><br/>BLOGS INFORMATIVOS<br/><br/>Não estresse<br/><br/>cidade<br/>Kristen Hogan<br/>&#124; Nov 12, 2020<br/><br/>Stress, não importa o quão grandes as coisas estão indo, ele sempre pode encontrar uma maneira de levantar sua cabeça feia. Se é um pedido de emprego de última hora ou um papel que você esqueceu de escrever e é devido no dia seguinte, o estresse sempre pode encontrar um caminho em seu dia, se você permitir. Hoje vou mostrar-lhe algumas coisas que você pode fazer para eliminar ou prevenir o estresse.<br/><br/>A primeira coisa que você pode fazer é se exercitar. Exercício é uma ótima maneira de aliviar o estresse, porque reduz o hormônio do estresse em seu corpo conhecido como cortisol. Os níveis mais baixos de cortisol em seu corpo, menor será o seu nível de estresse. Exercício também pode aumentar a sua confiança, e quando a sua confiança é para cima, em seguida, o seu stress é geralmente para baixo. Para mim, quando fico estressado, eu sempre me exercito indo ao ginásio e praticando boxe, isso me ajuda a queimar calorias e reduzir o estresse enquanto me divirto.<br/><br/>Escrever as coisas tem sido uma maneira de acalmar as pessoas por um tempo muito longo, e é o próximo tópico em nossa lista. Escrever o que está fazendo você estressado é uma maneira de limpar a mente, e ajuda a se livrar do estresse também. Eu tenho uma experiência semelhante ao escrever histórias, geralmente se eu não consigo pensar em uma nova ideia por causa de uma antiga, eu vou escrever a velha ideia e pensar sobre isso. Isso é quando novas ideias começam a surgir e eu posso continuar a escrever normalmente. É o mesmo com o estresse. Pense em um riacho que continua a fluir pelo seu caminho até atingir uma barragem de castores, e essa barragem bloqueia o fluxo de água e tudo começa a se acumular. A única maneira de obter o fluxo de água de volta ao normal é remover a barragem. É aí que entra a escrita. Quando você a escreve, você está removendo o estresse peça por peça até que você possa pensar normalmente novamente.<br/><br/>O estresse pode entrar em nossas vidas através de portas em nossa vida que mantemos abertas. A procrastinação é uma maneira de deixar as portas abertas para o estresse. Esperar até amanhã pode ser divertido para hoje, mas vai machucá-lo amanhã, e é uma solução muito míope. Quanto mais você esperar para fazer algo, maior será o tamanho de algo, e quanto maior ele se tornar, mais estresse você estará convidando para sua vida. Cuidar de algo assim que o recebemos é uma ótima maneira de prevenir o estresse, mas é algo que leva grande disciplina para fazer. Quanto mais você cortar a procrastinação de sua vida, mais livre de estresse você estará. Então feche a porta, está deixando sair todo o ar frio.<br/><br/>Então, vamos rever: Exercício, anote o que está estressando você, e não procrastinar. Estas são apenas algumas maneiras de aliviar o estresse, mas para mim, eles são os mais eficazes. Embora eu saiba que isso pode não funcionar para todos, gostaria de convidar qualquer pessoa que se sinta estressada para pesquisar como se livrar dele. |
