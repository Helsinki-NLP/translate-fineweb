In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Blog de Certificação de RCP Online<br/><br/>Data: 23 de julho de 2014<br/><br/>A doença renal intersticial autossômica dominante é uma rara coleção de doenças que afetam as funções conhecidas do rim. Em termos simples, a condição é caracterizada por: desenvolve-se uma doença renal e passa por um transplante renal e outras doenças associadas à concentração de ácido no sangue e gota. Em teoria, a condição ocorrerá mesmo se a alteração genética é herdada de um dos pais e ocorre esporadicamente quando não há histórico familiar.<br/><br/>Nomes comuns de doença renal intersticial autossômica dominante<br/><br/>A condição também tem outros nomes, a saber: doença renal cística medular, embora este nome não seja usado tanto porque a maioria das pessoas que sofrem desta condição não tem cistos medulares. Também é referida como nefropatia hiperuricémica juvenil. A doença tende a afetar pessoas com idades entre 20 e 50 anos. Esta última condição, como mencionado acima, ocorre em crianças pequenas, algo que se traduz em obtê-la de ambos os pais.<br/>A doença renal cística é uma condição hereditária em que os cistos no centro de cada rim perdem gradualmente sua capacidade de funcionar corretamente. Os cistos referem-se a bolhas anormais de líquido no rim. A condição assusta ainda mais o rim tornando incapaz de concentrar a urina e, como resultado, produzindo muita urina. Seus sintomas incluem micção excessiva, desejos de sal, fraqueza, confusão, sangramento, fadiga, soluços frequentes, pressão arterial baixa, náuseas e vômitos, dores de cabeça, pele pálida, sensação reduzida nas mãos, perda de peso entre muitos outros. Outras complicações incluem: anemia, úlceras, perda de densidade óssea, infertilidade e outros problemas relacionados ao coração.<br/>Sua análise incorpora exames de sangue para verificar os níveis de sódio e funções renais gerais, exames de urina para verificar os níveis de concentração e outros desequilíbrios, raios-x para verificar o tamanho dos rins que podem ser alterados devido ao aumento das concentrações de urina, biópsia renal e testes genéticos para verificar quaisquer alterações genéticas que possam ter ocorrido no devido tempo.<br/>Embora a doença não tenha um corte e tratamento seco, pode-se se concentrar em medidas de controle, que incluem a ingestão de líquidos e sal para complementar o perdido à medida que a doença progride para os últimos estágios. Isso também ajuda a reduzir a desidratação. Outros tratamentos incluem tomar medicamentos prescritos e mudanças na dieta e ingestão mínima de alimentos contendo fósforo e potássio. Outras complicações também podem exigir que se tenha um transplante renal. Basicamente, esta não é uma doença curável, mas sim uma doença gerenciável, uma vez detectada nos estágios iniciais.<br/><br/>O fator comum, mas diferente, da doença renal intersticial autossômica dominante<br/><br/>A nefronoftise e a doença renal cística medular são agrupadas principalmente porque, em essência, compartilham as mesmas características, mas com uma ligeira diferença nos padrões de herança em relação à primeira afetando crianças e à segunda afetando adultos jovens e grupos etários mais velhos. Características semelhantes para ambos são a concentração de urina resistente a ADH que leva a poliúria e polidipsia, anemia e doenças renais.<br/>A primeira condição é autossômica recessiva contabilizando 15% das doenças crônicas e causa ESRD durante a primeira infância, enquanto a última é autossômica dominante com algumas novas mutações esporádicas e causa ESRD para pessoas entre as idades de 30 e 50. |
| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | O relato de Hobbes vs. Locke sobre o estado da natureza<br/><br/>Tópico: FilosofiaPalavras: 2539Páginas: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes e Locke estão entre os filósofos políticos mais influentes que já escreveram em inglês. O estado da natureza, que precede a organização das sociedades complexas, é a premissa comum que Hobbes e Locke compartilham, mas interpretam de maneiras diferentes. O primeiro vê os seres humanos em seu estado natural como igualmente perigosos e livres para perseguir seus objetivos egoístas sem restrições pelas noções inexistentes de justiça, e é por isso que seu estado natural equivale à "guerra de todo homem contra todo homem" (Hobbes 76). Este último, por outro lado, vê os seres humanos em sua condição original como igualmente valiosos e restringe a liberdade natural pela ideia de justiça que exige não prejudicar os outros, o que permite definir o estado da natureza como "assistência e preservação mútuas" ao invés de guerra (Locke 15). A principal diferença entre os relatos dos dois filósofos sobre o estado natural é que Locke usa considerações éticas, enquanto Hobbes não, e isso, em última análise, leva Hobbes a imaginar um estado exercendo poder ilimitado sobre os seres humanos, enquanto Locke limita o governo pelos princípios morais, que ele considera uma lei natural.<br/><br/>Hobbes baseia suas suposições sobre o estado da natureza no fato de que todas as pessoas são aproximadamente iguais em suas capacidades físicas e mentais. Ele admite que alguns indivíduos podem demonstrar maior força física ou intelecto superior, mas insiste que "quando tudo é contado em conjunto, a diferença entre o homem eo homem não é tão considerável" (Hobbes 74). Uma vez que os seres humanos são aproximadamente iguais em suas capacidades, eles também têm esperanças semelhantes para alcançar seus fins e satisfazer suas necessidades (Hobbes 75). Como resultado lógico dessa igualdade, quando as pessoas começam a competir por recursos escassos, ninguém pode se sentir completamente seguro em suas posses. Mesmo que uma pessoa poderosa, astuta e capaz consiga subjugar "as pessoas de todos os homens que puder", isso ainda não garante a segurança final (Hobbes 75). Como nenhum ser humano pode obter tal superioridade sobre os outros que o torna completamente imune à sua força de intelecto, nenhum ser humano pode se sentir completamente seguro quando cercado por seus iguais. A igualdade de Hobbes no estado natural é a igualdade do medo, onde todos os seres humanos veem uns aos outros como concorrentes perigosos.<br/><br/>Assim como Hobbes, Locke considera que todos os seres humanos são fundamentalmente iguais, mas atribui um significado muito diferente ao termo. De sua perspectiva, não é a igualdade de capacidades, mas sim a igualdade de valor. Ele opina que as pessoas "promiscuamente nascidas com todas as mesmas vantagens da natureza" devem logicamente desfrutar da perfeita igualdade entre elas, pois não há razão para considerar alguém inerentemente mais valioso (Locke 8). A única base possível para designar algumas pessoas como superiores a outras seria se Deus "por qualquer declaração manifesta de sua vontade, colocar um acima do outro" (Locke 8). Uma vez que tal sanção divina de superioridade está ausente, Locke conclui que a igualdade natural de todos os representantes da humanidade não deve ser questionada. Hobbes aborda a igualdade de forma pragmática e enfatiza que as pessoas em seu estado natural são igualmente perigosas, mas Locke emprega uma abordagem ética e enfatiza que os seres humanos são igualmente valiosos aos olhos de Deus. Este desacordo é apenas a primeira diferença entre os dois autores com base no fato de que Locke inclui Deus como uma premissa em sua filosofia política, enquanto Hobbes não.<br/><br/>Outra característica do relato de Hobbes sobre o estado natural é sua interpretação da liberdade. De acordo com Hobbes, o estado da natureza implica liberdade ilimitada para fazer o que for necessário para a continuidade da existência. O filósofo define a liberdade como "a ausência de impedimentos externos" no uso de suas habilidades para alcançar seus objetivos (Hobbes 79). O objetivo principal de todo ser senciente é manter sua existência contínua. Como conseqüência, a liberdade hobbesiana equivale à oportunidade desimpedida de fazer qualquer coisa que, a nosso critério, seria mais adequada para preservar a vida e as posses de alguém (Hobbes 79). A única limitação à liberdade é que uma pessoa não pode fazer nada contraditório para sustentar sua vida ou destruir "os meios de preservar a mesma" (Hobbes 79). Além disso, não há limites, e todos têm "um direito a tudo, mesmo ao corpo do outro" se isso promover a sobrevivência (Hobbes 80). Assim, a liberdade natural, como vista por Hobbes, é a ausência de obstáculos externamente aplicados na busca de seu direito a tudo para sustentar e garantir sua existência contínua.<br/><br/>Locke também defende a ideia de liberdade natural, mas, sem surpresa, aborda-a de uma maneira significativamente diferente da de Hobbes. Assim que ele começa a discutir a liberdade no estado de natureza, ele imediatamente observa que um estado de liberdade não equivale a "um estado de licença" (Locke 9). O filósofo identifica duas limitações específicas para a liberdade humana no estado de natureza. A primeira é idêntica àquela introduzida por Hobbes: por mais livre e independente que seja, uma pessoa, no entanto, "não tem a liberdade de se destruir" (Locke 9). No entanto, a segunda limitação contradiz diretamente as preposições de Hobbes. De acordo com Locke, todo ser humano tem a obrigação natural de não "prejudicar o outro em sua vida, saúde, liberdade ou posses" (9). Assim como com sua interpretação da igualdade, o autor baseia essa afirmação em fundamentos éticos e religiosos: as pessoas devem preservar a existência umas das outras, já que são todas criações do mesmo "onipotente e infinitamente sábio criador" (Locke 9). Assim, Locke limita a liberdade no estado natural muito mais rigorosamente do que Hobbes, introduzindo a obrigação de se abster de prejudicar a si mesmo e aos outros.<br/><br/>As diferenças entre os dois autores também se manifestam em seus relatos de justiça no estado natural da humanidade. No que diz respeito a Hobbes, delinear práticas justas e injustas é meramente uma questão de lei. Não há jurisprudência no estado de natureza, e a única lei que rege os seres humanos em sua condição original é uma lei natural que apenas os obriga a buscar a segurança pessoal. Como resultado, nada pode ser injusto no estado original da humanidade: "noções de certo e errado justiça e injustiça" não têm lugar e nenhum significado na ausência da lei estritamente aplicada (Hobbes 78). Enquanto as pessoas usarem sua liberdade praticamente ilimitada para competir implacavelmente umas com as outras por recursos, aos quais elas têm igualmente direito, elas não têm critérios para diferenciar entre ações justas e injustas. Portanto, o estado de natureza hobbesiano desafia a própria ideia de justiça, uma vez que o autor a interpreta como uma mera função da lei formalizada e estabelecida.<br/><br/>Locke atribui significado diferente à justiça e a vê não tanto em termos legislativos, mas em termos éticos. Este artigo já mencionou que, ao contrário de Hobbes, Locke emprega noções éticas e geralmente baseia sua filosofia política em pressupostos morais e não puramente práticos. A lei natural de Locke, ao contrário da de Hobbes, obriga os seres humanos a cuidar uns dos outros, em vez de simplesmente deixar todos se defenderem. Como resultado, há um lugar para a justiça e a injustiça em seu estado de natureza. O próprio autor aponta para este fato quando observa que ninguém deve privar outro de sua vida dos meios de preservá-la "a menos que seja para fazer justiça a um ofensor" (Locke 9). Esta afirmação revela com a máxima clareza que, de acordo com Locke, há justiça no estado de natureza, e, além disso, os seres humanos têm que preservá-la ativamente. O critério de justiça, que o estado natural de Hobbes não possui, é a segunda limitação à liberdade natural imposta por Locke: uma ação é injusta se constitui uma ameaça injustificada à vida e às posses de outra pessoa.<br/><br/>Essas diferenças no tratamento dos dois autores de igualdade, liberdade e justiça ou injustiça culminam em sua interpretação da relação entre o estado de natureza e o estado de guerra. Do ponto de vista de Hobbes, os dois são sinônimos, porque a competição implacável é o único resultado lógico de colocar pessoas com capacidades equivalentes e necessidades semelhantes em um ambiente com recursos limitados. Ele afirma esta conexão abertamente: "se qualquer dois homens desejam a mesma coisa, que, no entanto, eles não podem ambos desfrutar, eles se tornam inimigos" e, portanto, estão em estado de guerra uns com os outros (Hobbes 75). No entanto, uma vez que os seres humanos são numerosos e todos possuem capacidades e necessidades semelhantes, essa competição se manifesta não apenas nas interações individuais, mas também no nível da humanidade como um todo. Enquanto todos os seres humanos tiverem direitos iguais e ilimitados a todos os recursos e até mesmo aos corpos e vidas uns dos outros, o estado da natureza é uma guerra de "todo homem contra todo homem" (Hobbes 76). Esta interpretação sombria deriva diretamente da representação de Hobbes do estado da natureza como governado exclusivamente pelos impulsos egoístas dos indivíduos.<br/><br/>Locke, por outro lado, diferencia entre o estado de natureza e o estado de guerra e aponta que, embora possam ocorrer simultaneamente, não é razão para identificar um com o outro. A definição de Locke do estado de guerra é virtualmente idêntica à oferecida por Hobbes. De acordo com Locke, "aquele que tenta colocar outro homem em seu poder absoluto coloca-se assim em estado de guerra com ele" (14). Esta explicação se encaixa perfeitamente com a noção hobbesiana de que o direito universal de todos a tudo, incluindo os corpos e as vidas das outras pessoas, leva ao estado de guerra. No entanto, Locke se recusa a igualar o estado de guerra e o estado da natureza precisamente porque ele nega a interpretação de Hobbes da liberdade natural. Uma vez que o estado natural de Locke impede as pessoas de se prejudicarem umas às outras através da segunda limitação da liberdade, uma tentativa de liberdade de outra pessoa é uma transgressão contra a lei natural. Enquanto para Hobbes, a guerra é a condição da humanidade por padrão, Locke a retrata como uma perversão do estado da natureza, em vez de sua regra.<br/><br/>Essas diferenças na delimitação do Estado sobre a natureza e seus constituintes, como a liberdade, a igualdade, a justiça e a guerra, abrem o caminho para os autores que contrastam retratos de governo. Com base em sua avaliação pessimista do estado da natureza, o autor de Leviatã conclui que, em condições de guerra, não pode haver esperança definitiva de "viver o tempo que a natureza normalmente permite que os homens vivam" (Hobbes 80). A solução é estabelecer o direito universal a tudo e deixar a cada um "tanto liberdade contra os outros homens quanto permitiria a outros homens contra si mesmo" (Hobbes 80). Os participantes do contrato social resultante investem as liberdades ilimitadas que renderam em um soberano - o portador do poder supremo cujo propósito é preservar o status quo alcançado punindo todas as transgressões contra ele. O poder do soberano é absoluto: o governante tem a autoridade de "fazer tudo o que julgar necessário" para promover a paz entre seus súditos para que ninguém ataque a vida ou a propriedade de outrem. Hobbes conclui que sem uma figura tão inatacável com o direito de fazer qualquer coisa aos súditos, não pode haver paz e nenhuma garantia de segurança.<br/><br/>Embora Locke concorde com a necessidade de criar sociedades politicamente organizadas, ele, no entanto, se opõe à ideia de Hobbes do poder soberano como ilimitado e inatacável. Como mencionado acima, o estado de natureza de Locke não é tão terrível quanto o pintado por Hobbes por causa da obrigação do povo de preservar não apenas a si mesmo, mas também um ao outro. Portanto, a necessidade de contrato social não surge do medo dos outros, mas da pura conveniência. As pequenas comunidades podem não precisar de inúmeras leis para resolver conflitos e "oficiais para supervisionar o processo", mas associações maiores acham aconselhável instituir governos para esse fim (Locke 57). No entanto, o poder do governo não pode ser ilimitado, porque resultaria em subjugar os súditos a uma "vontade inconstante, incerta, desconhecida e arbitrária de outro homem" (Locke 17). Tal governo constituiria uma dupla violação da lei natural. Ao concordar com o poder absoluto de outra pessoa sobre sua vida, um sujeito violaria sua primeira limitação proibindo-se a se prejudicar. Quanto ao governante, destruir a liberdade de outra pessoa constituiria um dano direto e, como tal, seria contraditório à segunda limitação.<br/><br/>Como uma continuação direta de seu caso de autoridade governamental ilimitada, Hobbes nega a separação de poderes como um princípio. De sua perspectiva, o soberano, uma vez instituído, possui "todo o poder de prescrever as regras" que regem a vida dos súditos ou, em termos mais curtos, o poder legislativo (Hobbes 114). O soberano também se reserva o direito de “ouvir e decidir todas as controvérsias” – isto é, o poder judicial (Hobbes 114). Finalmente, uma vez que todo o propósito do soberano é forçar os súditos a abster-se de prejudicar uns aos outros, não pode haver dúvida de que o poder executivo é também sua prerrogativa exclusiva. A separação de poderes como um conceito é alheia a Hobbes por causa de suas visões sobre o estado da natureza. Criar uma entidade política onde os ramos executivo, legislativo e judicial se verificariam – ou seja, competiriam – significaria recriar o estado hobbesiano de natureza-como-guerra em um nível mais alto. Uma vez que o povo entra em um contrato social e institui um governo para colocar o estado de natureza por trás deles, não restaurá-lo em uma forma diferente, a separação de poderes contraditória pontos de vista de Hobbes diretamente.<br/><br/>Locke, por outro lado, abraça a separação do poder como um princípio fundamental de sua teoria política. Seu argumento para a separação é evidente na discussão dos limites do poder legislativo. Como diz Locke, dificilmente seria aconselhável "que as mesmas pessoas, que têm o poder de fazer leis, tenham também em suas mãos o poder de executá-las" (76). O filósofo aponta para as imperfeições da natureza humana e o desejo inerente de "agarrar o poder" como uma justificativa para esta medida de precaução (Locke 76). Assim como no caso de Hobbes, o relato de Locke sobre a separação de poderes deriva diretamente de sua interpretação do estado da natureza. Se já existe justiça no estado de natureza e o povo pode compreendê-la, qualquer governo está inevitavelmente sujeito à mesma lei natural. Como o poder absoluto sobre as pessoas viola ambas as limitações desta lei, separar e distribuir é aconselhável para que o governo funcione adequadamente.<br/><br/>Este artigo demonstrou que, embora as diferenças entre os relatos de Hobbes e Locke sobre o estado natural da humanidade sejam numerosas, elas equivalem, em última análise, à ausência de premissas morais. Hobbes vê o estado natural como o de liberdade ilimitada, onde as pessoas dotadas de capacidades iguais e não vinculadas por quaisquer noções morais, como a justiça, competem incessantemente pelos recursos. Locke, no entanto, interpreta a igualdade e a liberdade eticamente e não praticamente e opina que a guerra é uma perversão do estado natural, como a lei natural obriga os seres humanos a não prejudicar uns aos outros. Hobbes insiste em um governante todo-poderoso, pois, na ausência de restrições éticas, nenhuma outra autoridade poderia forçar os humanos a se absterem de prejudicar uns aos outros. No entanto, na visão de Locke, conceder poderes ilimitados ao governo seria contraditório às limitações éticas incorporadas na lei da natureza, razão pela qual ele, ao contrário de Hobbes, defende a separação de poderes. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Polícia da moda: o que Game of Thrones vomitou<br/><br/>O cantor canadense-francês Abbas Hasan fez um esforço cego para superar toda a humanidade no Fashion Parade 2014. Nada de errado com isso, exceto que a segurança é prioridade e o músico é um perigo para a saúde aqui.<br/><br/>Entendemos que ele quer ser uma estrela. Infelizmente, ele não recebeu o memorando onde eles dizem ao desesperado e ao infame que o estrelato é uma metáfora. Você não tem que parecer um e literalmente incendiar nossa visão. Além disso, a All Pakistan Aunty Association apresentou oficialmente uma queixa contra ele. O mercado local secou de cristais falsos e monstruosidades lantejoulas. Eles não têm nada para vestir em seus chás altos quinzenais e eles alegam que ele é o culpado. Aparentemente, a roupa é inspirada em Game of Thrones. Ele pode, por favor, continuar compondo músicas tristes sobre o cão morto de seu vizinho em vez de conceituar roupas? Ou talvez seja o trauma de perder o cão, cuja morte ele claramente não acabou, já que ele ainda está vestindo sua carcaça.<br/><br/>A folha de carga Outfit<br/><br/>Ninguém pode decidir onde a roupa começa e onde Abbas termina. Você olha fascinado, afundando em um abismo profundo e se pergunta por que ele está vestindo calças de couro. Qual cavalo ele matou para roubar a sela coberta em seus ombros? Ele estava na prisão antes da sua aparição no tapete vermelho e se esqueceu de tirar as correntes? Como ele sobreviverá ao couro sintético e à erupção cutânea pós-sequin que deve ser letal em uma dosagem tão alta? Por que ainda estou vivo?<br/><br/>Ideia<br/><br/>Sua inspiração foi aparentemente Game of Thrones, mas ele acabou parecendo que ele foi jogado para fora de um restaurante Viking. Se ele se deparasse com qualquer um dos personagens da série, ele teria sido morto nos primeiros cinco segundos do primeiro episódio.<br/><br/>A saúde mental ou a falta dela: Alguém o leve a um conselheiro o mais rápido possível! Ele parece estar sob a suposição de que usar um cão morto significa que o único amigo que ele teve em sua vida ainda está vivo. Caro Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Negação não é um rio no Egito<br/><br/>2. Sua psique torturada não está ajudando sua música, então obtenha ajuda<br/><br/>3. Experimente amigos imaginários<br/><br/>Saia da fiança!<br/><br/>Todos nós na sede da Polícia de Moda estamos gravemente traumatizados. Abbas é alguém que não gostamos de prender. Ele está atualmente sob custódia e tentando se vingar vestindo roupas de outros shows de fantasia. Ele acabou de se colar para se parecer com Edward Cullen de Crepúsculo. Como uma mensagem de serviço público e para evitar mais colapsos nervosos, demos-lhe os seguintes exemplos de homens do tapete vermelho do mesmo evento.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>Em caso de dúvida, jogue com segurança. O cantor parece o seu tio médio em um shaadi. Um terno preto simples sem acessórios, mesmo que seja um pouco desproporcional, é viável. O olhar de Zohaib é misturado em tudo e nada, e quando você não tem um senso de moda ou o dinheiro para contratar um estilista, isso está tudo bem. Não carrega o risco de parada cardíaca para colegas participantes de um evento. Dada a delicada condição mental de Abbas, este olhar é o que ele deve procurar, sempre e para sempre.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>Um dia, depois de décadas de terapia, Abbas poderia aspirar a usar roupas como as de Ali Zafar. O olhar corajoso de verão é feito quase à perfeição. Ali chegou muito perto de parecer um maître d em um restaurante francês com sua jaqueta de verão branca com lapelas pretas, mas a camisa salva, não importa o cetim. Suas calças teriam sido ridículas se não tivessem sido dobrados nos tornozelos. Os sapatos são o que hipster chique finais felizes são feitos de. |
| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil.... [Show full abstract] | Determinação das propriedades hidráulicas do solo com diferentes líquidos humidificadores : Uma tese apresentada em cumprimento parcial dos requisitos para o Mestrado em Ciências da Universidade de Lincoln<br/><br/>Abstrato<br/><br/>As propriedades hidráulicas do solo, como a condutividade hidráulica, a retenção de água e as relações de água da planta, dominam os processos de movimento da água. Por exemplo, a infiltração, a evaporação e o fluxo de água dentro do solo. Como um fenômeno generalizado no solo, a repelência da água do solo altera as funções hidráulicas do solo, resistindo ao fluxo de água nos solos. Além disso, as propriedades hidráulicas não dependem apenas do sistema de poros do solo, mas também são afetadas pelas propriedades físico-químicas das superfícies dos poros. Em comparação com a água, o etanol não é afetado pela repelência à água devido à sua menor tensão superficial. O objetivo do uso de etanol é eliminar o efeito da repelência à água do solo nas medições de propriedades hidráulicas. No entanto, a aplicação de etanol puro no solo natural pode degradar os materiais orgânicos do solo e levar a mudanças nas propriedades físicas. Portanto, as soluções aquosas de etanol podem ser uma opção alternativa, mas a viabilidade do uso de etanol aquoso para determinar a curva de retenção de líquidos do solo permanece desconhecida. Este estudo tem como objetivo testar a viabilidade das soluções aquosas de etanol (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % e 100 % v/v) para estabelecer a curva de retenção de líquidos sob uma pequena faixa de pressão aplicada em amostras de areia grossa com diferente humidificação e solo natural modificado orgânico (Templeton silt loam (TSL) com compostagem de cogumelos, biochar, e efluente lác O resultado mostrou que a dessorção das soluções aquosas de etanol de teste em comparação com a água foi mais rápida em aproximadamente 1 a 3x com base no teor de líquido na mesma pressão aplicada e no tempo para atingir cada equilíbrio. Os resultados do experimento de areia sugeriram que quando a concentração de solução aquosa de etanol estava abaixo de 50%, as perdas por evaporação eram inferiores a 1% e as diferenças relativas entre o líquido de teste e a água eram inferiores a 10%. No entanto, as perdas por evaporação foram de 11,06 % e 24,6 %, e as diferenças relativas foram de cerca de 15 % e 30 % na solução de etanol a 50 % e 100 %, respetivamente. Em contraste, as alterações orgânicas no lodo de limo de Templeton não só aumentaram a capacidade de retenção de água, mas também reduziram as perdas de evaporação. As perdas de evaporação no solo TSL e TSL com modificações orgânicas do solo foram de 1 % em soluções com teor de etanol inferior a 50 %. As perdas de evaporação de 50 % e 100 % de etanol foram de 2,8 % e 2,9 %, respectivamente. As diferenças relativas entre a água e o líquido de teste foram semelhantes às do experimento de areia quando as concentrações de líquido de teste estavam abaixo de 50%. No entanto, as diferenças relativas na solução de etanol a 50% e 100% foram menores do que na amostra de areia com cerca de 10% e 15%, respectivamente. Além disso, a análise da diferença relativa sugeriu que quase todas as soluções aquosas de etanol apresentaram menor teor volumétrico de líquido na mesma pressão fornecida em comparação com a água, o que foi um reflexo das soluções aquosas de etanol dessorvidas mais rapidamente do que a água sob pressão equivalente. Por conseguinte, 10 % a 40 % das soluções de etanol poderiam ser consideradas uma alternativa para determinar as propriedades hidráulicas do solo devido à sua taxa de dessorção mais rápida e não serem afetadas pela repelência da água do solo. Devido à evaporação e dissolução de material orgânico, soluções aquosas de etanol acima de 50% de concentração não eram adequadas para areia grossa ou solo de textura média....
