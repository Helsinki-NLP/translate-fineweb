Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Navegação de posts<br/><br/>"Life Without Papers" ganha prêmio de Melhor Escrita<br/><br/>O projeto do blog, "Life Without Papers", criado por Len Grant, apresenta histórias de famílias e jovens migrantes indocumentados. Os migrantes indocumentados não têm nada. Eles não são autorizados a trabalhar. Eles não têm direito a benefícios estatais nem a um lugar para viver. Eles são invisíveis e potencialmente o grupo mais vulnerável no Reino Unido hoje.<br/><br/>Os migrantes indocumentados (ou irregulares) incluem aqueles que são traficados para o comércio sexual ou para a servidão doméstica; eles incluem os que ficam em excesso de visto; aqueles cujos pedidos de asilo foram recusados e outros que foram sujeitos a falhas no sistema de imigração. Tudo isso pode ter vindo originalmente para o Reino Unido legalmente.<br/><br/>Os "imigrantes ilegais" - aqueles que se imaginam terem entrado no país nas costas de caminhões - compõem uma pequena proporção dos indocumentados.<br/><br/>De fato, algumas fontes sugerem que metade das 120.000 crianças indocumentadas estimadas no Reino Unido realmente nasceram aqui de pais indocumentados. Essas crianças são desfavorecidas desde o nascimento, apenas por seu status de imigração.<br/><br/>O blog conta as histórias dos indocumentados. Ele destaca suas lutas e vulnerabilidades diárias, mas também sua força e resiliência. Não é uma leitura fácil.<br/><br/>Você pode acessar o blog através do nosso site (parte inferior da coluna da direita na página inicial).<br/><br/>O blog ganhou a categoria on-line dos prêmios de mídia Speaking Together. Os prêmios foram uma nova adição este ano à celebração do Prêmio Mulher Migrante e Refugiada do Ano no Royal Festival Hall, em Londres, como parte do Dia Internacional da Mulher. O painel de juízes – incluindo a romancista e dramaturga Gillian Slovo, e a jornalista e escritora Hannah Pool – estava particularmente à procura de trabalhos que desafiassem mitos e estereótipos.<br/><br/>O blog também ganhou o Blog North Awards 2013 na categoria de Melhor Escrita e também foi selecionado para um prêmio da Anistia Internacional de Mídia. |
| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Lição da Escola Sabática<br/><br/>Em Gálatas, Paulo aborda questões como a liberdade, o papel da lei na salvação, nossa condição em Cristo e a natureza da vida guiada pelo Espírito, bem como a pergunta antiga: Como os humanos pecadores podem ser feitos justos diante de um Deus santo e justo?<br/><br/>Muitos estudiosos acreditam que os Gálatas podem ser as primeiras das cartas de Paulo. Foi escrito em 49 dC, pouco depois do famoso Concílio de Jerusalém (Atos 15). Portanto, o livro pode ser o mais antigo documento cristão conhecido. Como Atos e Gálatas deixam claro, a igreja primitiva se viu em uma feroz batalha sobre a natureza da salvação, especialmente no caso dos gentios. De acordo com um grupo de crentes judeus, conhecidos como judaizantes, a crença em Jesus sozinho não era boa o suficiente para os gentios. Os gentios também devem ser circuncidados e seguir as leis de Moisés (Atos 15:1).<br/><br/>O guia de estudo bíblico deste trimestre nos convida a viajar com o apóstolo Paulo enquanto ele implora aos gálatas que permaneçam fiéis a Jesus. Também nos dá a oportunidade de refletir sobre nossa própria compreensão das verdades que abriram o caminho para a ruptura final de Martinho Lutero com Roma e a restauração do evangelho bíblico. |

Papa e imperador foram superficialmente reconciliados em 1076, mas o ano os viu novamente envolvidos em hostilidades ativas. Henrique, em conseqüência de repetidos atos de rebelião, declarou Welf deposto em seu ducado recém-adquirido. No entanto, apoiado por seus fiéis bávaros, e ajudado por seu pai na Itália, Welf foi capaz de manter seu lugar, no entanto, Gregório morreu em 1085 e seus sucessores tomaram uma parte menos intensiva nos assuntos da Alemanha. Welf, embora ainda aderindo ao partido da igreja, após o divórcio, em 1070, de sua primeira esposa, casou-se com Judite de Flandres, filha de Balduíno IV, Conde de Flandres, e a viúva de Tostig Godwinson, Conde de Northumbria. Em 1089, o filho de Welf, Welf, casou-se com Matilde da Toscana, fortalecendo assim as relações com o papa, no entanto, depois que o jovem Welf se divorciou de Matilde em 1095, Welf fez as pazes com o rei Henrique IV e foi reconfirmado em sua posição como Duque da Baviera.

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Acompanhe-nos<br/><br/>VOCÊ É UM<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Querendo açúcar? Aqui está o que seu corpo está tentando lhe dizer<br/><br/>cidade<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>FOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Ganho de peso a partir de desejos fora de controle à parte, pode ser frustrante ter um anseio constante por algo insalubre e não saber por quê. A boa notícia é que geralmente há uma razão subjacente a esse desejo ardente de abrigar um saco de batatas fritas, ou a sensação de que você pode realmente morrer se não pegar um picles imediatamente (mesmo que você não esteja grávida). Se você está tendo visões de barras da Via Láctea, por exemplo, isso pode significar que você está perdendo um nutriente muito específico em sua dieta. (Sim - é mais complicado do que dizer barra de chocolate sendo tão deliciosa.)<br/><br/>Nós conversamos com a nutricionista Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., de Los Angeles, para obter o magro em alguns desejos alimentares comuns, bem como o que você pode fazer para saciar a fome sem ir ao mar. Continue rolando para algumas informações seriamente boas!<br/><br/>Se você está com fome de chocolate<br/><br/>Isso significa: Você pode estar faltando magnésio em sua dieta, diz Lenchewski. "O magnésio é um mineral essencial envolvido na produção de energia, metabolismo da glicose e função muscular. Isso é especialmente verdadeiro para aqueles que atingem o ginásio duro", explica ela. Além disso, os níveis de magnésio são mais baixos durante as semanas pré-menstruais do seu período, o que explica por que a TPM tantas vezes vem com desejos de chocolate.<br/><br/>Em vez disso, procure chocolate amargo de alta qualidade e baixo teor de açúcar, que é naturalmente rico em magnésio. "Eu recomendo ficar com 75% de cacau ou mais, e emparelhá-lo com outra fonte rica em magnésio, como sementes de girassol", diz Lenchewski. Ela sugere a marca de chocolate Hu, uma empresa de alimentos em pequenos lotes que se concentra em ingredientes de alta qualidade produzidos localmente. "É um pouco caro, mas ainda mais motivo para manter as porções sob controle", diz ela. "É o meu favorito pessoal." Nós também somos grandes fãs de superalimentos embalados Zenbunni.<br/><br/>Se você está com fome de doces<br/><br/>Significa: "O desejo de açúcar puro é uma boa indicação de que você está ficando sem energia", diz Lenchewski. "Pense nisso. Qual é a única coisa que você está coçando depois de uma noite terrível de sono ou em torno de 4 p.m. durante um dia de trabalho estressante? A resposta é geralmente o açúcar, porque é usado como combustível instantâneo para as células do nosso corpo.<br/><br/>Em vez disso, procure maçãs com manteiga de nozes. "Se você está invadindo o estoque de doces de seus colegas de trabalho, recomendo um carboidrato de queima mais lenta com uma fonte de gordura ou proteína", diz Lenchewski. "Ao contrário do açúcar simples, isso irá alimentar suas células, evitando o acidente pós-açúcar. Duas opções que fazem grandes pick-me-ups da próxima vez que você está com fome de doces: uma maçã fatiada com a sua escolha de manteiga de nozes, ou bagas com 2% de iogurte grego sem açúcar. Nós gostamos de esmagar um dente doce com esses chips de coco viciantes, também – eles estão cheios, livres de qualquer açúcar adicionado e tão bons.<br/><br/>Se você está com fome de sal<br/><br/>Isso significa: "Se nada além do picles mais salgado vai fazer, você pode não estar bebendo H2O suficiente", diz Lenchewski. "O sal ajuda o corpo a segurar a água, então nós o ansiamos quando precisamos de fluidos."<br/><br/>Em vez disso, pegue água. "Fique hidratado, especialmente à medida que nos aproximamos dos meses de verão", diz ela. Da próxima vez que um desejo atinge, tente extingui-lo (literalmente) com alguns copos refrescantes e você pode achar que a urgência de compulsão por sódio desaparece. "Se a água pura te entedia, tente adicionar hortelã, limão ou frutas congeladas para misturá-lo", diz Lenchewski. E se isso ainda não fizer o truque, há uma alternativa mais saudável para batatas fritas ou batatas fritas ensacadas. "Se você está realmente apenas ansiando por sal, as algas torradas são uma ótima opção de baixa caloria", diz ela.<br/><br/>Se você está com fome de carboidratos de amido como macarrão<br/><br/>Isso significa: “Como os alimentos ricos em carboidratos aumentam a serotonina, o hormônio do bem-estar, os desejos de amido podem ser um sinal de que você precisa de um impulsionador do humor”, diz Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Em vez disso, pegue um banho! "Expulse os sais de Epsom, porque é hora de um R + R sério", diz Lenchewski. "Confie em mim. Confiar em um amido livre-para-todo se sente muito bem no momento, mas provavelmente vai te espantar mais no dia seguinte." Então, da próxima vez que você quiser mergulhar primeiro em uma tigela de carboidratos, desenhe um banho, acenda uma vela e trate-se sem nenhum arrependimento ou calorias densas.<br/><br/>Se você está com fome de sorvete<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>Isso significa: "Seu corpo pode estar dizendo que precisa de alguma gordura saudável".<br/><br/>"Eu sou realista, então se você está com fome de sorvete, eu não vou recomendar um punhado de nozes, que são, é claro, cheio de gordura saudável", diz Lenchewski. "Para emergências de sorvete, recomendo sorvetes de coco com baixo teor de açúcar, como o Coconut Bliss ou o sorvete de três ingredientes do Kippy em Los Angeles." Podemos garantir que o sorvete de coco tem um sabor incrível e igual ao real.<br/><br/>Se você está com fome de um hambúrguer<br/><br/>Isso significa: Você precisa de ferro. "Se você não consegue parar de pensar em carne vermelha, há uma chance de seu corpo estar ansiando por ferro, b12 e ácido fólico", diz Lenchewski. "Isso é especialmente verdade durante ou por volta dessa época do mês."<br/><br/>Em vez disso, procure um hambúrguer mais saudável. "Sou um defensor da carne vermelha alimentada com grama, antibiótico e livre de hormônios uma vez por semana", diz Lenchewski. "Tente experimentar com um hambúrguer de búfalo de cara aberta - que, cortado para cortar, é mais magro e tem mais ferro do que a carne bovina". Tente incorporar algum tipo de suplemento de ferro à base de plantas em sua rotina, como a espirulina. |

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience.

Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India. With unmatchable expertise in technical domain, he has been offering professional web consultation services to his clients located all round the globe. He is also an avid writer and some of his commended work have been published on renowned websites | Serviços Web, Fornecedores e Leis Cibernéticas!<br/><br/>Atualizado em:Abril 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>A informatização deste mundo mudou o cenário de desempenho humano em grande medida e também além da medição. Por exemplo, Agora você pode enviar informações vitais em todo o mundo com um único clique do mouse, graças à conectividade à Internet. Infelizmente, é essa ampla conectividade e popularidade entre as pessoas, a internet também aumentou as chances de crimes de computador. Crimes de Internet ou crimes de computador são amplamente conhecidos como 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' é algo novo no sistema judiciário, mas ganhou muita atenção ultimamente. O termo crime cibernético é algo muito sinônimo de crime convencional, a única diferença sendo meio de execução. Existem principalmente dois tipos de crimes cibernéticos, o primeiro é em que os computadores são os principais alvos e estes incluem casos de danos aos dados, código malicioso e até mesmo acesso a dados criminosos. O segundo é em que o computador é apenas uma ferramenta usando a qual crimes convencionais são cometidos para, por exemplo, terrorismo cibernético, spam, cyber stalking e muitos mais.<br/><br/>É aqui que um consultor de sites ou um fornecedor entra em cena. Embora não esteja ciente de todas as leis cibernéticas presentes até o momento, um fornecedor de sites pode aconselhá-lo sobre algumas das leis cibernéticas mais vitais ao criar seu site.<br/><br/>Isso pode incluir o conhecimento comum de direitos de cópia ou até mesmo proteger o conteúdo do seu próprio site. Explicar todos os direitos que você possui como proprietário do site também é uma das tarefas que um fornecedor de site pode fazer durante o desenvolvimento do seu site. Um fornecedor também pode ajudá-lo, oferecendo-lhe informações sobre diferentes leis cibernéticas para proteger os dados. Além de tudo isso, um fornecedor também pode oferecer-lhe informações sobre qualquer nova lei cibernética que você pode não estar ciente até saber. As leis cibernéticas podem variar de país para país, um exemplo recente pode ser a lei de cookies lançada no Reino Unido, que impede o site de salvar quaisquer dados de navegação do usuário. De acordo com a Lei de Cookies, os sites no Reino Unido não podem salvar arquivos de cookies sem o consentimento informativo do navegador.<br/><br/>É após a implementação de tal lei, os sites agora têm uma janela pop-up, que busca o consentimento do visitante para salvar arquivos de cookies. Esses arquivos são usados pelos sites para analisar o padrão de navegação dos visitantes com base em quais anúncios são então publicados em uma janela do usuário. Com hacking não mais uma coisa nova para todos nós, você acha que tais regras e regulamentos podem prevenir falsificação on-line ou crime cibernético? A tecnologia desenvolveu-se a uma taxa rápida, mas ainda assim as pessoas não preferem fazer compras on-line devido ao medo de dados pessoais ou bancários serem hackeados. Com o aumento do crime cibernético, a necessidade de leis cibernéticas rigorosas também aumentou para frear o mesmo e promover uma experiência de compra livre de risco.<br/><br/>Classes de crimes cibernéticos<br/><br/>Ao longo dos anos, houve três principais classes de crimes cibernéticos:<br/><br/>O acesso não autorizado de casos do sistema de computador, que envolve hackear ou roubar nomes de usuário e senhas para obter acesso sobre informações pessoais do respectivo usuário. Este tipo de acesso backdoor é organizado com a ajuda do Cavalo de Tróia. Lançamento de programas maliciosos como Trojan House, worms ou vírus de computador etc. A última classe inclui cyber stalking um usuário ou assédio online.<br/><br/>Implicações diretas dos crimes cibernéticos<br/><br/>Diminuição nas vendas<br/><br/>Diminuição da produção de pessoal devido a atrasos na rede<br/><br/>Perda de informações personalizadas, como trabalho de pesquisa<br/><br/>Interrupção no processo de comunicação<br/><br/>Implicações indiretas dos crimes cibernéticos<br/><br/>Problema de credibilidade no nosso sistema financeiro<br/><br/>Imagem de marca manchada no mercado<br/><br/>Os crimes cibernéticos afetam o relacionamento entre empresas no mercado<br/><br/>Perde-se o senso de confiança nas políticas estatais e nas agências governamentais<br/><br/>Prevenção do Crime Cibernético<br/><br/>Como internautas, existem certas precauções que devemos considerar para uma experiência on-line segura e protegida. Aqui estão algumas delas:<br/><br/>A primeira coisa a fazer é manter as informações pessoais para si mesmo e evitar compartilhar as mesmas on-line.<br/><br/>Evite compartilhar fotos com amigos de bate-papo on-line ou estranhos.<br/><br/>Instalar a versão mais recente do antivírus no seu sistema pode oferecer-lhe uma boa linha de defesa contra ameaças da Internet como vírus e malware.<br/><br/>Mantendo o backup de seus dados valiosos é uma boa opção para evitar problemas como a contaminação por vírus.<br/><br/>Evite enviar informações de cartão de crédito para sites que não são garantidos e não têm qualquer certificado válido.<br/><br/>Instalando um programa de segurança que lhe oferece controle sobre os cookies do site e evita que você seja rastreado por sites.<br/><br/>Colocar dispositivos de detecção de intrusões baseados em host nos servidores ajudará você a acompanhar irregularidades no tráfego do seu site.<br/><br/>Recomenda-se o uso de firewall.<br/><br/>Por que os ataques cibernéticos são tão populares?<br/><br/>Mais barato do que os métodos tradicionais de trapaça<br/><br/>Rastrear crimes cibernéticos não é fácil<br/><br/>Locais exatos não podem ser facilmente rastreados<br/><br/>Ausência de barreira física no mundo da internet<br/><br/>Crimes cibernéticos afetam um grande número de pessoas<br/><br/>Conclusão<br/><br/>O fato de que a mente humana tem um poder insondável é inegável, e é por isso que os crimes na Internet estão aumentando a uma taxa tremenda. Até mesmo a história testemunhou algumas das maiores seguranças da internet que foram destruídas pelas mãos de hackers, que também escaparam facilmente. A única maneira de conter esse crime é permanecer ciente das leis cibernéticas que temos hoje, que podem ser através da Internet ou através de fornecedores de sites / TI. A Lei de Tecnologia da Informação tem de ser equilibrada de tal forma que se revela demasiado rigorosa para as pessoas envolvidas em crimes cibernéticos e, ao mesmo tempo, nunca deve prejudicar o crescimento da indústria da Internet.<br/><br/>Autor Bio: – Maneet Puri atualmente está liderando uma empresa de design web de qualidade localizada em Nova Délhi, Índia.
