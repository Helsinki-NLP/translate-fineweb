| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Postado por Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa é uma planta perene que prospera em regiões subtropicais e tropicais pantanosas em todo o mundo. A erva altamente considerada é um ingrediente-chave em Doxiderol, um suplemento nutricional que melhora a função cognitiva. A Bacopa foi escolhida por sua capacidade de proteger o cérebro e aumentar a acetilcolina, um mensageiro bioquímico que permite que o sistema nervoso transmita informações.<br/><br/>Os praticantes ayurvédicos descreveram pela primeira vez as propriedades terapêuticas da bacopa em 300 aC. Os médicos registraram as habilidades da bacopa para melhorar a inteligência e a memória. Quase 2.500 anos depois, um crescente corpo de pesquisas modernas confirma os benefícios cognitivos da bacopa registrados no texto ayurvédico.<br/><br/>Em 1987, pesquisadores na Índia avaliaram os efeitos do bacopa sobre a função intelectual de crianças em idade escolar. Durante o estudo de quatro semanas, eles administraram bacopa a 40 crianças que tinham de 6 a 8 anos de idade. Os cientistas determinaram que a bacopa aumentou a percepção e a memória. As crianças foram capazes de resolver exercícios de labirinto mais rápido e com mais precisão depois de receber bacopa. Muitos pais na Índia rotineiramente usam bacopa para melhorar o desenvolvimento intelectual de seus filhos.<br/><br/>Um estudo de 12 semanas publicado na edição de agosto de 2001 de Psicofarmacologia investigou os efeitos da bacopa sobre a função cognitiva. Os cientistas aleatoriamente atribuíram os voluntários saudáveis, com idades entre 18 e 65, para receber bacopa ou uma substância inativa. Eles também usaram uma configuração dupla-cega para o estudo para ocultar as identidades dos produtos. Os pesquisadores usam esse design para garantir que os resultados do teste sejam válidos porque elimina o viés pelos pesquisadores e participantes. O grupo de bacopa experimentou uma melhoria significativa na velocidade em que foram capazes de processar informações visuais. Os participantes também aprenderam mais rápido e armazenaram novas memórias de forma mais eficiente.<br/><br/>Em 2007, um estudo de laboratório da Texas A&M College of Medicine revelou um dos mecanismos responsáveis pela capacidade do bacopa de promover a saúde do cérebro. De acordo com os cientistas, a bacopa usa polifenóis para prevenir o estresse oxidativo e os danos que causa às células cerebrais saudáveis. Bacopa também reduz os depósitos prejudiciais de uma substância conhecida como beta-amiloide, que é o principal componente da placa no cérebro de pacientes com doença de Alzheimer.<br/><br/>Um estudo duplo-cego publicado na edição de julho de 2008 do Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine avaliou o efeito da bacopa em pacientes idosos. O estudo confirmou que a bacopa aumenta o desempenho cognitivo e reduz o estresse. Segundo os autores, os benefícios obtidos neste estudo confirmaram os resultados de pesquisas anteriores.<br/><br/>Um estudo de 90 dias publicado na edição de dezembro de 2008 da Phytotherapy Research confirma os benefícios cognitivos que foram demonstrados anteriormente em outros estudos de bacopa. O Bacopa melhorou significativamente a capacidade dos participantes de armazenar e usar temporariamente as informações necessárias para concluir uma tarefa complexa. O estudo duplo-cego também demonstrou que o bacopa reduziu o tempo necessário para processar informações visuais.<br/><br/>Além de melhorar a transmissão do sinal nervoso, os cientistas teorizam que a bacopa aumenta a função cognitiva, reduzindo a ansiedade. Numerosos estudos indicam que a ansiedade interfere na capacidade de realizar tarefas que exigem funções cognitivas de nível superior, como aprendizado e memorização. O estresse interrompe mensageiros bioquímicos e transmissão de sinais nervosos saudáveis. Bacopa alivia o estresse e restaura uma sensação de calma, aumentando os níveis de acetilcolina, o que reduz a frequência cardíaca e permite que você respire mais profundamente.<br/><br/>Doxiderol é uma ótima maneira de obter os benefícios do bacopa. Este suplemento holístico também contém outros ingredientes naturais que promovem a saúde do cérebro e apoiam sua capacidade de se concentrar e se concentrar em tarefas complexas, bem como memorizar informações. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state.

Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war.

Ela também pode sentir auras demoníacas, bem como auras do mal. Quando ela nasceu e cresceu, no entanto, seus poderes foram selados e ela era muito menos poderosa. Desde a derrota de quem selou seus poderes, Kagome alcançou seu pleno potencial.<br/><br/>Ao fazer uma conexão física, Kagome tem a capacidade de purificar tanto o veneno quanto a escuridão de um sujeito (vivo e inanimado). Para fazer isso, ela projeta seus poderes espirituais através de sua mão.<br/><br/>Com todo o seu potencial, Kagome tem a capacidade de criar uma barreira em torno de si mesma e expandi-la em torno de outros. É uma barreira em forma de cúpula que pode destruir demônios fracos que fazem contato com a barreira.<br/><br/>VISÃO MELHORADA<br/>Kagome tem a capacidade de ver coisas que são muitas vezes invisíveis ao olho humano: fantasmas, espíritos, auras divinas e do mal.<br/><br/>ABILITAÇÕES COM ARMAS<br/>Kagome tem a capacidade de usar um arco e flecha. Ela foi auto-treinada, e depois de anos de prática, sua flecha raramente perde sua marca. Além disso, Kagome tem a capacidade de infundir suas flechas com poderes. Ela pode infundir uma flecha com seus poderes espirituais que lhes permite penetrar forças demoníacas, destruir feitiços e purificar objetos. Ela pode infundir seu arco com seus poderes e desviar ataques inimigos. Ela tem a capacidade de infundir suas flechas com energia purificadora para purificar o veneno, bem como poderosos ataques demoníacos distantes. E, finalmente, ela tem a capacidade de contornar os outros com sua flecha: se seu alvo estiver atrás de uma barreira ou de um refém, a flecha pode se teletransportar e acertar apenas seu alvo.<br/><br/>O resto de suas habilidades se tornaram bastante insignificantes, pois estão relacionadas à viagem no tempo (através do Poço do Comedor de Ossos), a Jóia Shikon ou sua encarnação anterior.<br/><br/>O cânone<br/><br/>Kagome foi retirada alguns dias depois de sua graduação no ensino médio, no entanto, antes de o Poço do Comedor de Ossos ter sido aberto novamente para permitir que ela volte ao passado permanentemente.<br/><br/>Freestyle<br/><br/>Memórias<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>O som de seu nome era um sussurro suave no fundo de sua mente, como um grito abafado pelo vento. Era o som de uma memória distante, uma voz que ela tinha começado a esquecer, mas desesperadamente se apegou a tudo o mesmo. Era a voz de sua mãe, distorcida na tristeza de sua filha perdida. Afinal, Kagome baniu sem deixar vestígios. Ela se lembrou vividamente desses momentos, do modo como o dia tinha começado, o que ela tinha para o café da manhã e a última coisa que ela tinha dito a sua mãe. Era assombrante, aquelas memórias, porque era como qualquer outra vez que ela tinha deslizado entre mundos. Ela tinha acordado, desesperada, porque ela não tinha nenhum propósito fora da escola. Ela podia encontrar um emprego, e estava programada para uma entrevista naquele dia. Seu coração não estava nele, mas era o que ela precisava fazer.<br/><br/>Ela se lembrou do sentimento de medo, sugando-o e dando-se uma conversa animada de que ela poderia fazer isso. Que ela poderia progredir na vida que ela estava destinada a agora que as coisas tinham sido resolvidas no passado. Claro, ela tinha a sensação persistente de que ela não pertencia mais ao seu próprio tempo ou à sua própria vida. Não com tudo o que ela tinha deixado para trás.<br/><br/>Kagome lembrou-se da sensação da madeira sob seus dedos, da maneira como sua mão tinha enrolado no punho para deslizar a porta aberta. Lembrou-se de que ela fez uma pausa, voltando-se para sua mãe com um sorriso brilhante e vibrante enquanto ela se sacudia de seu estupor. "Estou decolando." Ela se lembrou de como sua voz soava forte, o sorriso nos lábios de sua mãe enquanto seus olhos brilhavam com orgulho. Sua mãe se despediu, o que não parecia diferente de antes, mas de alguma forma o peso das palavras se acalmou mais pesado nos ombros de Kagome quanto mais ela refletia.<br/><br/>Resumidamente, os pensamentos vacilaram para a frente, imaginando se sua mãe se preocupava com ela, sentia sua falta como ela. Kagome podia admitir abertamente que a força de sua mãe, seu apoio ao fato de que sua filha deslizava pelo tempo com tanta frequência. Houve momentos em que ela se achava fraca por não ter a mulher para se apoiar.<br/><br/>No entanto, ela se lembrou de que ela reuniu uma pequena quantidade de força. Ela podia se lembrar da mudança no ar, a temperatura notavelmente diferente do que ela esperava, piscando no ambiente repentino e desconhecido. Não era o santuário de sua família. E quando ela se virou para voltar, para escorregar pela porta que ela tinha entrado, ela foi encontrada com metal desconhecido e frio sob as pontas dos dedos e um interior que não era a entrada de sua casa. Um homem estava diante dela, atrás de um balcão, que a olhava com olhos tão amplos quanto os dela.<br/><br/>Ela não entrou em pânico, pelo menos, sendo arrancada através do tempo e colocada em situações impossíveis, pelo menos construiu sua força de vontade até onde os acontecimentos estranhos foram. Porque não era todos os dias que alguém se encontrava arrastado para o passado por um demônio, com a intenção de arrancar uma jóia poderosa de seu corpo que eles nem sabiam que estava lá. E então havia o fato de que ela tinha quebrado essa poderosa jóia em quem sabe quantas peças e tinha a tarefa de encontrá-las. Tais coisas não eram normais, e ela precisava se encaixar e rolar com isso uma vez que ela percebeu que era sua realidade. Parecia tão simples, basta recolher os fragmentos e consertar a jóia.<br/><br/>Mas não tinha sido fácil, havia muitos demônios depois dos fragmentos e da própria jóia. E um demônio particularmente poderoso com um desejo que ele estava determinado a ver cumprido. Até hoje, ela nunca tinha aprendido o seu desejo, mas sabia que ele nunca tinha sido concedido, mesmo que ele tinha a coisa explosiva concluída. Ele tinha arruinado tantas vidas para o bem de nada. Arruinou tantas vidas para uma tarefa tão fútil. Naraku tinha sido o inimigo mais difícil, e aquele que tinha sido o centro de tudo o que deu errado em todas as vidas de sua amiga.<br/><br/>Mas, foi essa imprevisibilidade, essa necessidade de rolar com o que estava acontecendo e a força de vontade que ela ganhou de sua aventura que ela se lembrou de tirar para chegar a uma história que se encaixava no momento que não parecia muito caprichoso ou muito procurado. Ela precisava ser acreditada, ela precisava sobreviver.<br/><br/>Afinal, ela enfrentou pior do que um homem em uma loja de câmeras. Ela tinha mentido através de seus dentes para salvar sua vida antes.<br/><br/>"Eu estava procurando um emprego." No final, não era uma mentira completa. Afinal, ela tinha saído de sua casa com a intenção de participar de uma entrevista de emprego. Seu estado de vestimenta, pelo menos, atestaria isso. Foi uma das mentiras mais fáceis que ela já havia contado.<br/><br/>E, por alguma razão, aquele louco a contratou.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolou em sua cama enquanto ela empurrava para trás as memórias distantes, recusando-se a reconhecer que ela estava realmente acordada. Ela coçou nos últimos vislumbres de sono, implorando-lhe para voltar e levá-la de volta para seu abraço. Ela fechou os olhos, querendo dormir para vir e só se encontrou com memórias. Os ecos de uma canção cantaram à distância de suas memórias, uma canção que muitas vezes a atormentava, dado o mesmo nome que ela. A voz que cantava não lembrava mais sua mãe, mas as vozes das crianças com quem ela costumava brincar quando crescia. Eles chamaram de volta as memórias, mesmo que tivessem passado anos desde que ela começou isso ao vivo, mesmo que ela fosse feliz nesta vida, o chamado dessas memórias era muito alto.<br/><br/>De repente, ela estava caindo de volta neles e o sono a evitou novamente. Ela estava se observando no abraço de sua família enquanto Inuyasha foi puxada de volta para o poço, parecendo tão assustada quanto ela havia sentido. As lembranças daquele momento, esses sentimentos, ainda eram tão fortes. O sentimento de desgosto e tristeza surgiu novamente, embora tivesse passado tanto tempo desde que ela se sentia como se tivesse sido arrancada de tudo o que importava para ela.<br/><br/>É claro que sua família importava, e ela estava feliz de estar em seus braços novamente. Ela nunca poderia descrever completamente, verdadeiramente, como ela se sentia naqueles dias. Ela ainda não conseguia explicar como se sentia dividida em dois, com desejos conflitantes de estar tanto em seu passado quanto em seu presente. Ela se lembrou das tentativas fúteis de pular pelo poço, com os dedos no chão em um pedido desesperado para deixá-la voltar. No primeiro mês em casa, ela não dormiu tanto quanto chorou.<br/><br/>Elysion havia enfeitado uma reação semelhante, embora não fosse tão feroz porque ela não sabia exatamente onde ela havia escorregado nem sabia onde ela poderia verme seu caminho de volta. Suas explorações foram sutis entre trabalhar seu trabalho e tentar se estabelecer nesta vida. Ela não tinha intenções de ficar, não tinha intenções de ficar mais tempo do que precisava. E embora ela não tentasse tão ferozmente como quando tentou voltar ao passado, sua paixão era dez vezes maior porque ela não tinha laços com este mundo. Porque ela estava verdadeiramente sozinha... sem esperança de que ninguém a alcançasse.<br/><br/>Em seus momentos irracionais, ela pensou que a Jóia a tinha puxado para trás e encontrou um novo inferno para ela residir. Um novo inferno que a forçaria a fazer um desejo, mas ela se lembrou muito claramente de que ela desejara que ele tivesse ido para sempre. Isso não impediu seus sonhos, os momentos em que ela acordava soluçando, e aquelas lembranças de seu passado eram as mais difíceis de lidar, as mais difíceis de esquecer. Seu coração começou a correr em pânico quando ela voltou para sua cama novamente, sua respiração tornou-se uma luta enquanto ela lutou contra um ataque de pânico induzido por sua mente vagabunda esta noite.<br/><br/>Ela odiava sentir-se tão fraca, tão assustada.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finalmente se levantou da cama, seu quarto iluminado com uma luz pálida que foi suficiente para guiá-la ao banheiro. Ela ficou diante do espelho, a pia correndo enquanto ela olhava para seu reflexo. O cabelo de corvo colorido cobriu seu rosto e ela se sentiu tão mal quanto parecia. Sua primeira manhã em Elysion foi semelhante a isso, mas ela estava em pior forma.<br/><br/>Ela havia encontrado um lugar para dormir, conseguindo chegar a um acordo com o dono do prédio para permitir que ela ficasse por um pequeno período de tempo sem pagar. Talvez tenha sido a influência de Miroku que lhe permitiu fazer tais acordos, como o monge era conhecido por seu caminho em encantar (ou enganar) as pessoas em dar-lhes mais do que o suficiente para o trabalho que tinham feito. O monge sempre foi assim, desde que se conheceram. Ele alegava que a habitação de um senhor era assombrada quando não era ou, alegava que eles estavam sujeitos a um ataque quando não seriam. Ele vendia seus aposentos e encantos por preços tão altos. Funcionou praticamente todas as vezes e ela se perguntou por que as pessoas estavam tão dispostas a confiar nele.<br/><br/>Talvez tenha sido seu sorriso, ou o fato de que ele era um monge que as pessoas do passado estavam tão dispostas a desmoronar. Ele nunca predava os fracos, pelo menos. Ele sempre fazia o que era certo e ele era um símbolo de força para ela às vezes, quando ele empurrava através de tudo, a fim de fazer o que era certo. Ele empurrou através do fato de que ele estava morrendo, que ele estava amaldiçoado, e tentou fazer algo sobre isso, em vez de se afogar em seu destino. Ele tinha empurrado-se ao limite no tempo que antecedeu a sua luta final. E ela tinha ficado feliz que eles tinham derrotado Naraku antes que ele pudesse se tornar sujeito ao mesmo destino que seu pai, e seu pai antes dele.<br/><br/>No que diz respeito aos seus próprios encantos, no entanto, ela era mais justa do que sua amiga e fez o negócio razoável. Ela duvidava que qualquer pessoa neste mundo pagaria um preço elevado por um exorcismo ou banir demônios. Eles eram tecnologicamente avançados demais para isso. Mas ela era esperta o suficiente, e esperta o suficiente, para fazer um bom negócio.<br/><br/>Mas agora, Kagome estava em um lugar melhor, embora o olhar em seu rosto parecia o mesmo. Assombrado, cansado, drenado...<br/><br/>Um rápido olhar para um relógio na parede lhe disse que ela poderia tentar dormir mais, mas ela optou por não fazer isso, não querendo enfrentar os flashbacks novamente. Em vez disso, ela tomou um banho, usando a água fria para expulsar seus demônios, para encher seus pulmões com uma respiração aguda e se forçar a acordar.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>Não funcionou.<br/><br/>Não do jeito que ela estava querendo. A água fria certamente forçou o ar em seus pulmões, forçou sua mente a acordar e os músculos a agarrar. Uma risada amarga foi puxada de seus lábios quando ela inclinou a cabeça para trás e encontrou-se lembrando mais. Hoje, ela não escaparia tão facilmente, não se recuperaria tão simplesmente, só porque queria.<br/><br/>Às vezes, não há como evitar os pensamentos que você queria, mesmo quando tinha certeza de que tinha passado por eles.<br/><br/>Sango teria sido uma grande ajuda nesta situação. O assassino de demônios era seu melhor amigo, ela iria até mesmo chamá-la de irmã que ela nunca teve. Uma irmã mais velha que era sábia, sempre teve seu lado quando surgiam problemas. Particularmente problemas de meninos, quando essas coisas eram bastante triviais, mas era divertido ter uma queda e para sua amiga ficar brava em seu nome quando Inuyasha a deixou triste. Afinal, muitas vezes tinha sido que o meio demônio corria para o lado de sua amante morta e quebrava seu coração mais de uma vez.<br/><br/>Mas Sango também a inspirou de outras maneiras. Depois de tudo que a mulher enfrentou, ela sempre foi tão forte, tão certa... Mesmo nos momentos em que ela duvidava de si mesma, ela sempre conseguia. Ela admirava que ela tinha a capacidade de sobreviver depois de perder toda a sua família - o lembrete disso muitas vezes empurrou Kagome para sobreviver, porque ela perdeu todos para este mundo - e, em seguida, ter seu irmão se tornou um peão de Naraku. Não era fácil, não poderia ter sido algo que qualquer um poderia enfrentar e ainda seguir em frente. Ela ainda sorria, mesmo com aquela dor e aqueles lembretes... Ela era muitas vezes tão brilhante, mesmo nos tempos mais sombrios.<br/><br/>E agora, ela queria se apoiar no lado da mulher mais velha, para se consolar com o fato de que ela estava lá e ela estava apoiando. Ela sentiu que Sango de alguma forma iria superar isso, e oferecer algumas palavras de força e compreensão. Foram momentos como esses que pioraram esses feitiços, o lembrete constante de que ela estava sem sua família.<br/><br/>"Eu não quero estar sozinha." Ela gritou em voz alta em sua solidão, o som do chuveiro afogando o apelo.<br/><br/>Ela não tinha medo de admitir.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Outra hora havia passado antes que ela percebesse. Sua pele estava fria da água e parecia que o gelo corria através de suas veias. Ela não tinha percebido que ela tinha começado a tremer até que sua mão alcançou para desligar a água e terminar seu chuveiro. Kagome não procurou seu próprio olhar no espelho novamente, em vez disso, ela se envolveu em toalhas e saiu do banheiro, subiu as escadas e entrou em sua cozinha. Ela começou a fazer um pequeno-almoço leve, lendo ociosamente suas anotações para o dia enquanto a comida era cozida.<br/><br/>Sua carreira estava realmente decolando nestes últimos anos. Suas fotos foram destaque em muitas galerias, seu nome começou a freqüentar muitos lábios para aqueles que estavam interessados em fotografia.<br/><br/>O trabalho que ela havia pedido por um capricho havia desencadeado tudo. Ela tinha sido muito mais sortuda do que esperava estar neste mundo. Nunca teve sorte o suficiente para escorregar pelas rachaduras em seu próprio mundo, mas teve sorte o suficiente para fazer bem. Quando voltou para o fogão, lembrou-se do tempo em que finalmente tinha desistido de voltar para casa. Foi cerca de dois anos em sua vida aqui, como ela tinha começado a aventurar-se na fotografia como mais do que apenas um hobby, mas algo que ela poderia fazer um nome para si mesma com.<br/><br/>Esse dia tinha sido particularmente agradável, o sol estava alto no céu e ela havia se encontrado tirando algumas fotos do cenário natural. Um garotinho havia se escondido em uma das plantas, e ela havia captado uma foto do momento em que seu rosto se havia acomodado em um sorriso alegre e travesso no momento antes de ele ter pulado para assustar sua presa. Isso a lembrou de Shippou, o pequeno kitsune que ela tinha, essencialmente, adotado. Ele também, tinha sido arrancado de sua família quando eles se conheceram. Seu pai matou e ele estava determinado a vingá-lo. Embora jovem, ele parecia tão maduro em seus primeiros encontros.<br/><br/>Talvez tenha sido a influência de Inuyasha que permitiu que o kit agisse como uma criança novamente, para ser jovem e caprichoso às vezes, enquanto outros ele era mais maduro. Ele lhe ofereceu conforto à sua maneira, e ela tentou cuidar dele como cuidaria dela, embora ela também fosse tão jovem na época. No entanto, sua juventude não a impediu de entender como cuidar dele ou cuidar dele como seu filho. Seu coração inchou quando ele sorriu, quando ele estava tão feliz por seu presente de lápis de cera e tomou o tempo para fazer arte. Ela estava tão orgulhosa de cada desenho que ele tinha terminado que ela sabia que era assim que uma mãe se sentiria em tal situação.<br/><br/>A dor que a rasgou foi muito, muito repentina. Ela sentiu falta dele e queria ver o quanto ele tinha crescido desde que ela tinha ido embora. Ela tinha perdido tanto...<br/><br/>Para se poupar de mais dores, de falsas esperanças, desistiu e concentrou-se em melhorar.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>O café da manhã tinha um sabor insípido, chato e inspirado. Somente depois que ela terminou ela percebeu que havia esquecido de qualquer tipo de especiarias ou sabor para a comida. Já era tarde demais para se lembrar disso, pois sua mente estava muito ocupada lembrando-se de outros detalhes de sua vida que claramente se tornaram mais importantes do que sua comida.<br/><br/>"Sente-se!"<br/><br/>É claro que nada aconteceu quando ela gritou com raiva para um cliente particularmente frustrante que a lembrava do meio demônio. Ele estava sendo particularmente teimoso e rude, querendo que uma foto fosse tirada em seu caminho, em vez de deixá-la funcionar naturalmente. Você poderia tentar forçar animais selvagens a se comportarem como você queria. Mas, raramente alguém teve sucesso com a força. Inuyasha não era tão ruim, no entanto. Inuyasha tinha aprendido antes de ter sido forçada a se afastar dele. Ele tinha se tornado mais gentil, mais compreensivo, mais maduro, embora houvesse momentos em que ele ainda era infantil e arrogante.<br/><br/>Ela se lembra de como suas bochechas estavam vermelhas, mas como ela se manteve firme e o demitiu. Ela disse a ele que se recusou a trabalhar para qualquer pessoa ou com qualquer pessoa que quisesse torcer algo além da natureza, além dos próprios desejos.<br/><br/>Ela deveria ter comparado o homem a Naraku em vez de Inuyasha. Embora seu cliente não tivesse intenções tão extremas. Pelo menos o sentimento depois era uma lembrança agradável. A liberdade de saber que ela tinha chegado tão longe que ela poderia recusar o trabalho que ela não queria fazer, para ser sua própria pessoa que era independente dos outros. Ela poderia dizer que ela conseguiu naquele momento. Mesmo que ela tenha ouvido rumores dias depois com palavras destinadas a caluniá-la.<br/><br/>Ela se defendeu com justiça, como fez no final de sua jornada. Afinal, ela era a única que podia se proteger neste mundo.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>A luz da manhã começou a se infiltrar em sua casa, lembrando-a novamente da passagem do tempo. Mais uma vez, ela considerou a lista de coisas que tinha que fazer e debateu por onde começar. Ou, se ela devesse começar. Com o começo do dia, ela não sabia se poderia considerar isso uma grande ideia. Era duvidoso que ela seria bem sucedida com o quão perdida em si mesma ela estava se tornando.<br/><br/>Ela não queria estragar seu último trabalho. Porque ela tinha feito isso em algumas ocasiões antes. Não foi agradável tentar se recuperar de um desastre completo.<br/><br/>Kagome lembrou-se da sensação de sua câmera cara, nova, escorregando de suas mãos. Ela não estava preparada para apoiá-la, porque ela acabara de removê-la de sua bolsa. Parte dela gritou por dentro. Uma gritaria dramática, exagerada, cheia de gritos que ela frequentemente fazia quando era muito, muito mais jovem. Quando ela estava lutando para passar pelo ensino médio enquanto pulava entre as vezes. A outra parte dela havia permanecido congelada no lugar, enquanto sua lente estava completamente quebrada e o resto da câmera havia quebrado junto com ela.<br/><br/>Ver o irmão de Inuyasha, um demônio cheio, em pé diante dela foi a última coisa que ela esperava quando ela tinha saído para suas fotos. Ele ficou tão orgulhoso como sempre, tão alto como sempre, tão imponente como ela se lembrava. Ele não parecia nada preocupado em estar em um mundo completamente diferente, embora ela nunca fosse a melhor em ler sua mente. Seu nome em seus lábios era tão potente, que ela podia se lembrar dos menores sentimentos como ela fez. Seus lábios estavam rachados, sua boca sentia-se seca, e a sensação borbulhante de ansiedade em seu estômago a fazia sentir-se doente.<br/><br/>Ela não queria que suas esperanças estivessem levantadas.<br/><br/>Mas, ela queria que ele estivesse lá, mesmo que eles não fossem amigos. Eles eram aliados, se é que alguma coisa, já que eles tinham lutado lado a lado. E algo era melhor do que absolutamente nada.<br/><br/>E Kagome teve a sensatez de não se atirar a ele, de abraçá-lo em relevo, sabendo que não estava sozinha. Sua câmera não importava mais quando ela se aproximava dele. Ela se lembrou de que nada mais importava por dias enquanto passava tempo com ele, não falando do mundo deles, mas falando (ou, ela estava falando e ele simplesmente reconheceu esse fato).<br/><br/>Quando, exatamente, ela se apaixonou por ele... Kagome não conseguia se lembrar. Era uma coisa sutil, assim como ele era. Mas ela sabia que o sentimento estava lá. E ele deixou-a saber que ela não estava sozinha no fato de que ela tinha caído, que os sentimentos tinham de alguma forma florescido.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>Uma sensação de leveza a atingiu e, de repente, seus olhos se abriram enquanto sua mente desesperadamente coçava para a última coisa que estava fazendo. Ela não se lembrava quando adormeceu em seu sofá, mas sabia que o último lugar que tinha estado era nas almofadas muito confortáveis. Ela não lutou, no entanto, ou lutar contra a ausência de peso, como ela estava em braços familiares. Sua cabeça inclinou-se contra o peito de Sesshoumaru, sentindo conforto no fato de que ele estava aqui e ela não estava sozinha.<br/><br/>"Bem-vindo de volta." Sua resposta foi um zumbido suave em reconhecimento. Ele não precisava falar muito para ela entender sua intenção, ou o resto do que ele tinha a dizer.<br/><br/>Ele a levou de volta para sua cama, a colocou nela com facilidade. Seus olhos se encontraram com os dele e ela sorriu facilmente porque não havia mais lembranças à deriva, não havia mais lembranças provocando-a. Não, sempre que ele estava perto, ela nunca mais caiu naqueles pensamentos. Ele tinha ajudado, e os anos tinham ajudado. Hoje foi apenas... um daqueles dias.<br/><br/>"Dormir." Ele ordenou com facilidade, seus olhos rolaram para ele, mas ela não lutou porque ela estava cansada. Sua mão se agarrou firmemente a ele, enquanto ela sentiu sua mão oposta pressionar sua testa em avaliação de seu bem-estar.<br/><br/>"Estou bem", disse ela, suas palavras firmes com sua promessa.<br/><br/>Ela estava bem, viva e feliz.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>expedidor<br/><br/>Sumário<br/><br/>Kagome, em um ponto de sua vida, era uma adolescente bastante regular até que ela foi atacada por um demônio dentro da casa do poço de sua família. O demônio a arrastou para o poço, o que a transportou magicamente cerca de 500 anos no passado. Lá, ela aprendeu que uma jóia sagrada estava encerrada dentro de seu corpo, pois ela era a reencarnação de uma sacerdotisa que havia morrido 50 anos antes do momento em que ela foi arrastada. A jóia foi arrancada de seu corpo e o demônio que a arrastou através do tempo foi derrotado pelo meio demônio que ela libertou que estava preso à árvore. Kagome fez amizade com o meio-demônio, Inuyasha, no tempo e viajou com ele para restaurar a jóia que ela, ela mesma, quebrou. Embora não fosse tão simples e fácil de fazer como muitos demônios e humanos procuraram a jóia para seus próprios propósitos. Ela fez amizade com um jovem demônio kitsune, um monge e um assassino de demônios que viajaram com ela para restaurar a jóia.<br/><br/>Seu grupo, no entanto, não foi o único a completar a jóia. Em vez disso, um meio demônio maligno que manipulou a maioria dos principais eventos na maioria das vidas de sua companheira. Quando ele finalmente recolheu todas as peças da jóia e fez seu desejo no objeto contaminado, Kagome foi atraída para a própria jóia com a intenção de ela fazer um desejo egoísta de mantê-la presa dentro para sempre, mantendo a jóia viva. Foi a teimosia de Inuyasha que conseguiu salvá-la da escuridão. No final, ela voltou ao seu tempo natural, terminou o ensino médio como era esperado de uma garota de sua linha do tempo. Embora dias depois, Kagome acabou em Elysion. Ela está neste mundo há cinco anos, e há muito tempo desistiu de voltar para casa. Ela se estabeleceu feliz em sua nova vida.<br/><br/>platonica<br/><br/>É bastante fácil para Kagome fazer novos amigos, ela não mudou muito desde a juventude. Ela é uma jovem alegre que é empática e acolhedora para a maioria de todos em sua vida. Em sua juventude, ela fez amizade com demônios quando a maioria teria medo deles. Mesmo os demônios que costumavam comer humanos, ela se tornou amiga e mudou seus caminhos (ela gostaria de pensar). Dito isto, é realmente fácil se tornar amiga dela, desde que alguém seja capaz de mostrar que está disposto a ser redimido, ou mostrar que não é completamente mau. Ela sente muito por todos que conhece, por isso é difícil para ela não ser atraída pelos outros em um desejo de ser amiga.<br/><br/>Antagonismo<br/><br/>A única maneira de ganhar a ira de Kagome é ser tão deplorável, tão má e tão além da redenção que ela não pode ver nada de bom em você. E ela pode ver o bem em praticamente todo mundo e tudo. Honestamente, com quem ela enfrentou? Um meio demônio que colocou dois amantes um contra o outro, que amaldiçoou toda a linha masculina de um de seus amigos, e depois fez com que o irmão de sua melhor amiga matasse sua família... Sim, eu não a vejo odiando ninguém sem eles realmente, realmente trabalhando para isso. Sinta-se à vontade para tentar.<br/><br/>Romântico<br/><br/>Quando apaixonada, Kagome é um forte apoio, sempre ficando lá mesmo quando as coisas podem ser difíceis. No entanto, Kagome não está procurando por amor, não estava procurando por amor quando chegou, então nenhum relacionamento passado existe. Isso não quer dizer que alguém não se apaixonou por ela. Ela definitivamente pode ser o assunto do amor não correspondido de alguém, ela provavelmente será alheia a isso, no entanto.

Francamente, ela ainda não trabalhou em tudo desde que ela estava essencialmente na cabeça de uma guerra em grande escala. Eu sinto que eles poderiam ser amigos, pois Corrin é bastante aberto em sua personalidade, extremamente confiante também. Ela está apenas... se escondendo e lutando por muito.

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Por que você deve estar no Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: Eu não sou, nem nunca afirmei ser, um guru das mídias sociais. Eu sou apenas uma pessoa que pensa muito sobre as coisas, e isso já surgiu várias vezes.<br/><br/>Eu não sou um early adopter. Às vezes, leva anos para descobrir o que eu quero usar algo antes de realmente entrar nele, e o Twitter foi uma dessas coisas. Eu estou no Twitter a sério desde cerca de fevereiro deste ano, então sou bastante novo nisso. Ainda assim, eu aprendi uma série de coisas, e eu queria compartilhá-las. Algumas pessoas dizem que eu sou um empurrador do Twitter, e eu sou, porque há muitas boas razões para entrar nele, e praticamente sem desvantagens.<br/><br/>Então, o que é o Twitter? Se você está na internet, você provavelmente já ouviu falar dele. É uma rede de mídia social que serve como um fórum para conversas, atualizações e notícias em um meio mais público do que algo como Facebook ou LinkedIn. O Facebook é sobre quem quer encontrar você, mas o Twitter é sobre quem você quer encontrar. Seus escritores, atores, políticos, cantores e cientistas favoritos provavelmente estão no Twitter. Assim como suas instituições de caridade favoritas, estações de rádio, sites de notícias e lojas. E eles querem que você os encontre e ouça o que eles têm a dizer. Todo mundo no Twitter, pelo menos inicialmente, quer falar com você.<br/><br/>Mas por que se juntar a isso? Por que fazer parte dele? Há todos os tipos de razões, e eu vou dar-lhe alguns.<br/><br/>O Twitter é uma ótima maneira de descobrir sobre eventos que estão acontecendo em todo o mundo, mas também em sua comunidade. Se você está viajando e procurando coisas para fazer, é uma ótima maneira de descobrir coisas relevantes para seus interesses (porque as pessoas que você segue são pessoas que você está interessado). Mesmo se você não estiver viajando, saber sobre ótimos lugares para ir localmente ou saber que as pessoas que você está interessado estão indo para eles cria uma oportunidade para conhecê-los e criar um relacionamento mais profundo com eles. Se você voltar ao meu post do partido, todas as pessoas nele, exceto duas, eu ouvi sobre isso no Twitter e depois nos conhecemos na vida real, e agora somos muito bons amigos. E quanto mais você fizer isso, mais coisas você descobrirá, e mais pessoas você conhecerá. E se você segui-los no Twitter, você já sabe um pouco sobre como eles são. Eles querem que você faça. O inverso também é verdade, porque o tweet convida as pessoas a ver como você é, e elas podem fazer as mesmas escolhas sobre você.<br/><br/>Inspiração e Motivação<br/>A inspiração vem dos lugares mais estranhos, e o influxo de tweets significa que há sempre conteúdo fresco para a sua imaginação. Eu tenho uma política de follow first, então eu vou seguir praticamente qualquer um, e depois periodicamente passar por e parar de seguir as pessoas. Eu não sei quem vai plantar a semente de um novo post ou novo projeto em mim, então eu gosto de manter minhas opções abertas. A motivação também acontece, porque o Twitter é como a vida. Se você se cercar de pessoas ambiciosas, dedicadas, generosas e trabalhadoras, é mais fácil ser assim e se esforçar. É mais fácil pensar que se eles podem planejar eventos, lançar projetos ou apenas se levantar de manhã, bem, você também pode.<br/><br/>Blogueiros de aprendizagem e estilo de vida estão no Twitter. Blogueiros que não estão realmente podem ser loucos. E as pessoas blogam sobre quase tudo. Se você está procurando aprender algo, as chances são boas de que alguém esteja twittando sobre isso. Além disso, os serviços de notícias e as lojas também estão conectados, o que significa que você pode obter suas notícias até o minuto, e descobrir sobre vendas e ofertas à medida que começam. No que diz respeito ao estilo de vida, à procura de novas ideias de receitas? Siga alguns fornecedores e veja o que eles vêm com. Precisa de uma torção para esse coquetel? Twitter tem pessoas para isso também. Recomendações de guarda-roupa, ou apenas quer ver o que as outras pessoas estão fazendo com suas vidas? Está tudo lá.<br/><br/>Existem alguns desafios comuns que eu enfrento quando falo sobre isso, e eles são obstáculos legítimos. Pode parecer bastante assustador, especialmente se você está entrando no carro até tarde, como eu fiz. Passei meses seguindo apenas duas pessoas e sem saber o que mais fazer. Mas há maneiras de superá-las, e ouvi que são de menos freqüentes para mais.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter é para idiotas narcisistas<br/>Acho que isso vem da ideia de que a maioria das pessoas twitta para e sobre si mesmas como uma maneira de chamar a atenção. O que eu não entendo é por que há algo de errado com isso, ou por que fazer isso faz de uma pessoa um narcisista ou um idiota. Se alguém tem algo a dizer, eles querem ser ouvidos. Costumava ser você ficar na esquina da rua e gritar. Agora você pode gritar em 140 caracteres ou menos. Twitter é apenas uma nova maneira de ser ouvido. Agora, certamente há idiotas narcisistas no Twitter. Às vezes, as pessoas são idiotas, às vezes uma dessas pessoas sou eu, lamento dizer, não siga essas pessoas. Se você não gosta do que alguém está dizendo, sejam esses pontos que eles estão fazendo ou contas detalhadas de suas atividades no banheiro, você não precisa ouvir no Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: Não consigo acompanhar tudo<br/>O segundo obstáculo que as pessoas muitas vezes levantam é que eles simplesmente não têm tempo para acompanhar todas as coisas que estão acontecendo no Twitter. E você sabe o que? Tudo bem. Mantenha o controle do que você pode. Talvez você só vagar em cada poucos dias. Se você é um usuário privado (ao invés de twittar para sua empresa), e especialmente um iniciante, tudo bem. Parte de algo é melhor do que nada.<br/><br/>#1 Eu não tenho nada que eu quero colocar lá fora<br/>Este é, de longe, o desafio mais frequente que as pessoas levantam. E nem importa. Você não precisa se juntar ao Twitter para conversar. Junte-se a ele para ouvir. Mais uma vez, seus autores favoritos, cantores, blogueiros e jornais estão aqui. Esta é a sua chance de ouvi-los. É a sua chance de ganhar uma janela em suas vidas e atividades, e eles estão convidando você para fazer isso. Quer saber o que Felicia Day vai fazer no San Diego Comic Con? Feito. Eu conheço pessoas que só ouvem no Twitter, e isso é ótimo. Isso é o que eu fiz por um tempo. Eventualmente, talvez você encontre algo para twittar, ou faça algo para twittar. Espero que sim, porque eu quero ouvir sobre isso.<br/><br/>Em suma, se você não está usando o Twitter, eu acho que você deve ser. Se você não está usando em toda a sua extensão, tente. Não tenha medo de seguir quinhentas pessoas, se todas essas pessoas estão dizendo coisas que você está interessado. Convide essas pessoas para partes de sua vida, e veja como a interação melhora. Estou ansioso para ouvir de você. |
| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Root Canals<br/><br/>O próprio pensamento de obter um canal radicular coloca a maioria das pessoas na borda. SCM Dental utiliza a mais recente tecnologia e técnica para fazer um canal radicular um procedimento praticamente livre de dor e baixo estresse.<br/><br/>A endodontia rotativa é uma tecnologia avançada e técnica para realizar o tratamento endodôntico, o termo clínico para um canal radicularO termo "canal radicular" refere-se à cavidade natural no centro do dente. O nervo do dente está localizado no tecido mole (pulpa) dentro do canal radicular. Se o dente é danificado por trauma ou decaimento, os detritos podem entrar na área sensível do canal radicular e causar uma infecção, ou em circunstâncias extremas, e abscesso. Um abscesso dentário é muito grave e deve ser tratado como uma emergência, pois pode criar uma infecção que pode se espalhar para outras partes do corpo. Se você acredita que tem um abscesso dentário, entre em contato com nosso escritório imediatamente para agendar atendimento de emergência.<br/><br/>Dependendo do caso, a terapia do canal radicular pode exigir mais de uma visita. Uma radiografia inicial será realizada para avaliar o dente e o canal radicular e determinar a extensão do dano e da infecção, se houver. Você será dado uma forma de anestesia para torná-lo relaxado.<br/><br/>Quando a área estiver entorpecida, nosso dentista criará uma câmara de acesso ao canal radicular usando um handpiece elétrico. Em seguida, o canal radicular será raspado do tecido e nervo infectados ou danificados. Uma vez que toda a área tenha sido completamente limpa e polida, o dente será preenchido com um composto de borracha biocompatível chamado gutta percha. O dente é então coberto com um preenchimento dentário ou coroa dentária para restaurar a força e a função.<br/><br/>A terapia endodôntica tem uma má reputação como sendo um procedimento doloroso. Com a endodontia rotativa, um procedimento de canal radicular não é mais doloroso do que ter um preenchimento dental colocado. A infecção e danos ao nervo é o que cria a dor extrema e desconforto e pacientes você vai experimentar alívio significativo depois de se submeter a terapia de canal. Os canais radiculares têm uma taxa de sucesso de 95% e permitem que as pessoas preservem seus dentes naturais. |
| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Churchyard Bottom WoodTradução<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Hotéis próximos a: Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Agora chamado Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Entre 1860 e 1880, o centro foi arrancado da cidade de Londres para construir esgotos, ferrovias e novas estradas. As casas foram demolidas sem levar em conta os inquilinos que tinham que encontrar qualquer acomodação que pudessem em outro lugar. Os gerentes foram para o livo em Kensington e St. John's Wood, enquanto os mais pobres se amontoavam nas rooteries como Seven Dials e Lisson Grove. Para aqueles entre os quais, os funcionários e trabalhadores qualificados, construtores especulativos colocaram fileiras após fileiras de moradias em terraços e o Sr. Pooter se mudou para Holloway. As pessoas de Muswell Hill observaram casas rastejando pelos campos de Finsbury Park, subindo Crouch Hill e descendo o outro lado, de modo que em 1880, Crouch End estava sendo desenvolvido e parecia não haver como conter o fluxo. Dez anos depois, as grandes propriedades de Muswell Hill estavam sendo vendidas. Upton Farm foi vendido e os Comissários Eclesiásticos queriam desenvolver Churchyard Bottom Wood, agora chamado de Queen's Wood. A história teria feito uma peça de Ibsen. Dois grupos de pessoas honestas e altamente motivadas lutando pelo que cada um achava certo. Os comissários eclesiásticos, por um lado, e o Comitê das Caridades de Hornsey, por outro, acreditavam que estavam fazendo o melhor por outras pessoas, e o público se levantou contra eles em indignação.<br/><br/>Naquela época, Muswell Hill Road era uma estrada rural, com Southwood Hall em uma extremidade e Upton Farm na outra. Em 1894, Onslow Gardens foi construído, Connaught Gardens marcado, e os construtores estavam prontos para desenvolver a propriedade Woodlands. Cortado de Churchyard Bottom Wood era um grupo de chalés caídos, em um local triangular. Um mapa sem data, mantido pelos Comissários Eclesiásticos, mostra seis Wasteland Cottages com uma abertura entre eles - não uma estrada, não metalizada, mas um caminho até os canteiros de morangos atrás. Mais adiante estava outra lacuna que levou a trilhas através da madeira. Essas duas aberturas deveriam ser a base do plano. As mesmas duas lacunas e o solo limpo, que era o campo de morangos, podem ser vistos no mapa de 1894 abaixo. Eles são mostrados como 'Muswell Hill Cottages' e, de passagem, Peter Sellers foi viver no mesmo local muito mais tarde. Para desenvolver a madeira como um conjunto habitacional, os Comissários precisavam dirigir duas estradas através de Muswell Hill Road e construir casas ao longo deles. A fachada da Muswell Hill Road por si só não teria fornecido espaço para casas suficientes para fazer o empreendimento valer a pena.<br/><br/>A terra e as casas de campo haviam sido dadas muito antes como casas de esmola para abrigar idosos e eram mantidas em seu nome pelos curadores dos comissários de caridade de Hornsey. Com espírito público, desejando fazer o melhor para seus antigos inquilinos, os curadores não podiam melhorá-los, pois não tinham dinheiro. Alguns anos antes, os comissários eclesiásticos haviam planejado desenvolver Gravel Pit Wood (agora Highgate Wood) como um complexo habitacional, mas isso havia encontrado tal oposição que eles recuaram. Em vez disso, em 1886, eles deram todos os 69 acres de floresta para o público. Ao mesmo tempo, eles se ofereceram para vender Churchyard Bottom Wood ao Conselho do Distrito Urbano de Hornsey por £ 25.000, mas isso era demais para Hornsey levantar por conta própria. O Conselho disse que as pessoas que vivem fora de Hornsey também gostavam da madeira e outras autoridades devem ajudar, mas nenhuma ajuda foi dada. No final, a oferta caiu em suspenso.<br/><br/>Mapa mostrando os Muswell Hill Cottages que foram o centro da controvérsia.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road em 1880<br/><br/>Parece provável que esses três pares de casas de campo foram os que estavam no centro da disputa.<br/><br/>Os comissários eclesiásticos queriam arrecadar dinheiro para o trabalho da igreja na Grã-Bretanha e no exterior. Eles consideraram que eles tinham dado a terra para ser usado para a propagação da religião e se isso significava vender terras ou florestas, era um mal menor do que restringir o trabalho da igreja. Eles haviam dado Gravel Pit Wood ao público: em seu lugar eles desenvolveriam Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>Os curadores das instituições de caridade de Hornsey queriam produzir uma renda para ajudar seus pobres, então fizeram uma oferta aos comissários. Seu pedaço de terra triangular era de forma muito desajeitada para ser desenvolvido economicamente, mas se os comissários lhes concedessem mais terra para torná-lo um local quadrado, eles construiriam vinte e cinco vilas limpas. Estas permitiriam à Comissão cortar duas estradas através das suas terras para que os comissários pudessem desenvolver as florestas.<br/><br/>Quando essa oferta se tornou conhecida, as pessoas imediatamente reagiram com alarme.<br/><br/>Em 16 de dezembro de 1893, o deputado Carvell Williams perguntou na Câmara dos Comuns, se os comissários eclesiásticos haviam consentido em vender uma faixa de terra para os curadores de instituições de caridade de Hornsey, com a condição de que uma estrada existente fosse ampliada para 40 pés, se isso era preliminar a um esquema de construção e se a Câmara do Parlamento teria a oportunidade de expressar uma opinião.<br/><br/>O Sr. Leveson Gower, um comissário de patrimônios da Igreja, respondeu: "Sim" à primeira parte.<br/><br/>Sr. Carvell Williams, "Eu entendo que é a intenção de destruir essa porção de Highgate Woods, construindo sobre ela?"<br/><br/>Dois dias depois, The Star publicou um artigo digno de qualquer tabloide moderno.<br/><br/>A estrela<br/>18 de dezembro de 1893<br/><br/>«O Parlamento deve estar atento a esses velhos vândalos e confederados do construtor de jerry, os comissários eclesiásticos, que estão sempre alienando algum pedaço de terra ou favorecendo os construtores em detrimento do público em geral. Os comissários não queriam vender a madeira de Churchyard Bottom aos contribuintes, mas agora propõem "abri-la" cortando duas estradas largas através dela em conexão com um dos seus numerosos esquemas de construção. Não vai alguém fazer uma pergunta ao Parlamento e verificar a política dos comissários?»<br/><br/>No momento em que isso foi impresso, a pergunta havia sido feita e a resposta era falsa ou desonesta. Outros jornais retomaram a história. O Times, em um longo relatório, disse que os comissários não estavam dispostos a assumir o compromisso de que o Parlamento, ou qualquer outro organismo público, deveria ter a oportunidade de considerar qualquer esquema de construção no local da madeira.<br/><br/>A situação ferveu por dezoito meses até que os comissários eclesiásticos foram forçados a abrir um inquérito, que começou em Highgate em 31 de maio de 1895, presidido por um comissário eclesiástico assistente. O Inquérito produziu uma enxurrada de cartas de jornal, das quais esta era a mais importante.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 de junho de 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISMO NA HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Senhor...<br/><br/>Um dos mais belos pedaços de floresta no subúrbio de Londres está ameaçado. Você vai nos ajudar a afastar o que seria uma calamidade, não só para o distrito imediato, mas para todo o densamente povoado norte de Londres? Em nenhuma parte da metrópole o construtor esteve mais ativo do que em Crouch End e Hornsey. Os belos prados de um ou dois anos atrás são agora casas e lojas. Pilhas de lastro tomaram o lugar de olmos e castanhas majestosas, e uma vez vilas agradáveis estão compartilhando o destino de Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury e Islington.<br/><br/>---- O objeto é a construção de duas estradas de quarenta pés através das florestas. Nós neste distrito sabemos o significado de estradas de quarenta pés através das florestas. Isso significa que as florestas estão condenadas. Dez anos atrás, a agitação salvou a madeira-irmã de sessenta e cinco acres naturais - The Gravel Pit Woods - e ninguém que viu as multidões do feriado do banco se amontoarem pela Archway Road das ruas sombrias de Holloway, Islington e Clerkenwell, e assistiu ao prazer agudo das crianças e festas de família dando um piquenique na grama do norte e entre as árvores, poderia não perceber o imenso. ----<br/><br/>Os comissários eclesiásticos possuem quase um terço da grande paróquia de Hornsey. Pela despesa liberal do dinheiro dos contribuintes na abertura de estradas e no desenvolvimento geral do distrito, o valor de sua propriedade aumentou enormemente, e desse aumento não merecido eles obtêm grandes receitas a cada ano. Certamente os contribuintes cujo dinheiro ajudou a criar a imensa propriedade podem esperar tratamento liberal em troca.<br/><br/>O seu obediente,<br/><br/>Assinado pelo Vigário de São Tiago, Muswell Hill, o Ministro da Capela do Parque, Crouch End, um advogado que vive em Onslow Gardens e três membros do Conselho Distrital.<br/><br/>Foi um tiro bem do outro lado dos arcos dos comissários eclesiásticos. Seus próprios líderes religiosos e o Conselho Distrital, todos em armas dizendo que a igreja era muito rica e deveria ser caritativa, não gananciosa. A inclusão dos dois clérigos foi um movimento astuto. Lembre-se de que isso ainda estava no auge da controvérsia de Darwin. Darwin tinha dividido a crença nos ensinamentos da Igreja e muitas pessoas teriam ressentido o poder da Igreja apenas desse ponto de vista. A Igreja não era tão segura como fingia ser.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 de junho de 1895 disse:<br/><br/>"Se os Comunssionários Eclesiásticos não forem abordados de uma só vez, o polvo da construção terá um aperto da madeira que será muito difícil de afrouxar mais tarde. Portanto, cabe aos londrinos estarem acordados e fazendo se quiserem salvar um de seus mais deliciosos pedaços de paisagem rústica. A investigação pública está adiada para quinta-feira e, antes disso, algo deve ser feito para convencer os comissários de que os cidadãos de Londres não tolerarão o confisco de um de seus playgrounds favoritos.<br/><br/>Uma carta no Daily Chronicle no dia seguinte dizia:<br/><br/>..... Foi com grande alívio que os moradores, há cerca de dez anos, ouviram que a compra da Floresta Superior havia sido efetivada; e quão deliciosa uma bênção isso provou, qualquer um que os visitasse pode testemunhar, mas todos os que se esforçaram para salvar essas florestas superiores, que ficam no lado oeste da estrada de Muswell Hill, sentiram que sua vitória estava incompleta enquanto os sessenta acres no lado leste permaneceram. É, por assim dizer, um acidente que as florestas sejam divididas por uma ampla estrada alta. Alguém pode duvidar do que seria o efeito se a madeira inferior do cemitério fosse substituída por fileiras de pequenas vilas, cada uma enviando sua contribuição de fumaça e fuligem? Pode alguém duvidar, também, da séria diferença que faria para o cenário pitoresco das florestas compradas se uma linha de novas casas fixas fosse atropelada diretamente contra sua frente frondosa?<br/><br/>Isso expressou as opiniões de muitas pessoas. Na verdade, o Gravel Pit Wood, que o escritor chama de 'Upper Wood', não tinha sido comprado, mas dado ao distrito pela Comissão Eclesiástica, um ponto que eles deveriam reiterar uma e outra vez ao longo dos anos, mas a maioria das pessoas ignorou. A Comissão não ia ceder uma segunda madeira, seja o que for que alguém dissesse, e manteve esta posição até ao fim.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, de 5 Cranley Gardens, em uma carta ao Times datada de 8 de junho de 1895, pediu a compra.<br/><br/>Eu sei que é comum falar muito pouco dos comissários eclesiásticos, mas como os administradores de um fundo eles são obrigados a administrá-lo para a maior vantagem, e por isso, se alguma coisa deve ser feita para salvar a demolição da madeira, parece-me que só pode ser realizada pela compra da propriedade dos comissários, que eu sei, estão plenamente vivos e abertos para a proteção do povo.<br/><br/>(Isto refere-se ao Crouch End Playing Fields que tinha sido assegurado alguns anos mais tarde.)<br/><br/>Como presidente da Associação Conservadora de Muswell Hill, estou constantemente em contato com os habitantes, e posso afirmar com segurança que cada pessoa residente na vizinhança faria qualquer coisa para preservar.<br/><br/>(Tudo o que ele queria pessoalmente era renda de caridade para sustentar seu povo pobre. Ele exigiu seu acre de terra - não muito com certeza - ele acreditava na garantia dos comissários de que a madeira não estava em perigo.)<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road foi uma das melhores de Hornsey e permaneceria igualmente bonita, casas ou sem casas.<br/><br/>(E então veio o grande florescimento retórico.)<br/><br/>Os pobres devem sofrer por causa das objeções sentimentais e do grito histérico do lobo que os seus correspondentes acabaram de levantar? Um hectare de terra acrescida ao imóvel de caridade não faria nenhuma diferença para a terra restante, enquanto o lucro derivado dela ajudaria muitas pessoas velhas e merecidas pobres em seus anos de declínio e nos permitiria entregar aos nossos sucessores uma propriedade que em um futuro distante seria de grande valor na prestação de ajuda de caridade para os pobres merecedores da paróquia de Hornsey.<br/><br/>Ao ler a sua carta, sente-se uma histeria muito próxima da superfície. Por que é que os Comissários pensavam que queriam construir uma estrada? Por que é que gastariam todo esse dinheiro se não para construir casas? Ele nunca pareceu perceber que por um acre de terra toda a madeira seria perdida. Mas ele estava com o problema por um longo tempo. Ele era a pessoa a quem os comissários haviam feito a oferta de venda por £ 25.000 anos antes e é seu nome que é honrado em uma placa na Torre do Relógio Crouch End por salvar a madeira, mas sua confiança nos comissários eclesiásticos parece ingênua. É triste que no Inquérito ele fosse lançado como o diabo.<br/><br/>O inquérito continuou<br/><br/>O adiamento foi aberto em Highgate em 15 de junho de 1895. Esperando uma grande reunião, a Câmara do Conselho foi completamente alterada. As mesas habituais foram removidas e a sala encheu-se de cadeiras. Às sete e meia, a sala estava lotada, com pessoas se esforçando para conseguir assentos.<br/><br/>O Sr. Murray, o Comissário, disse que o inquérito era realmente simples. Hornsey Parochial Charities desejava comprar um pedaço de terra adjacente à sua propriedade de caridade na parte de trás. A questão era se a Comissão de Caridade, que controlava todas as instituições de caridade, tinha poder suficiente para detê-las. Os comissários da Igreja estavam preparados para vender a terra em condições muito favoráveis e a renda da Caridade seria muito aumentada.<br/><br/>Contra isso havia três classes de objeções.<br/><br/>O Trust original tinha o propósito de fornecer casas de campo para os pobres, mas os administradores estavam propondo a construção de moradias que seriam muito caras para os pobres. No entanto, estava dentro do poder dos curadores variar os termos do Trust, para que eles pudessem construir moradias se pensassem que os pobres se beneficiariam no final. Os próprios pobres poderiam se opor, mas já haviam sido prometidas provisões liberais para eles. A terceira objeção dizia respeito ao lado estético e público da questão. Ele tirou isso do que ele tinha lido que a Comissão de Caridade deveria interferir para impedir os comissários eclesiásticos de exercer sua própria discrição em lidar com seus próprios bens.<br/><br/>O Inquérito discutiu pontos delicados, mas os oradores continuaram voltando ao grande problema de evitar qualquer destruição da madeira. O Vestry Clerk de Islington, representando 300.000 pessoas, fez um protesto formal sobre qualquer parte da madeira, tão valiosa para as pessoas de Islington e Hornsey sendo usada para fins privados. O Sr. Wilfred White disse que se os comissários lhes dessem tempo, eles seriam capazes de levantar o dinheiro para compensar os administradores.<br/><br/>O Sr. Beaumont disse que eles não queriam moradias, queriam chalés para pessoas pobres que estavam sendo expulsas do distrito. Outros disseram que não havia dinheiro para construir chalés para substituir os atuais decaídos, mas as moradias seriam uma proposta econômica. Outros responderam que havia dezenas de moradias para deixar em Highgate. A madeira era sagrada. Atenha-se à questão da madeira.<br/><br/>Dr. Fletcher disse que o grito entre os trabalhadores era que não havia para onde ir. Trabalhadores vieram até ele com o grito: "Somos expulsos de Highgate e somos obrigados a ir para Highgate New Town." Se a fachada da Muswell Hill Road fosse vendida, não havia dúvidas de que as estradas poderiam ser cortadas através da floresta na direção de Hornsey, mas se os comissários não conseguissem obter a terra da Comissão de Caridade, não poderiam cortar a estrada.<br/><br/>Ele estava muito certo de que as casas poderiam ser colocadas em um estado apto de reparo. Ele foi convidado pelos pobres, pela polícia e por um número de classes trabalhadoras para representar esses dois pontos, que o alojamento cottage era muito necessário em Highgate e que, se uma vez que eles permitiram que a terra fosse vendida, não havia como dizer onde a mão do construtor ficaria.<br/><br/>(Aplausos fortes e prolongados).<br/><br/>Várias outras pessoas falaram e o comissário resumiu dizendo que ele considerou que a opinião predominante era a favor da manutenção das casas de campo, mas a reunião não deve tirar conclusões do que ele tinha dito (Groans).<br/><br/>Outros disseram que os curadores da Caridade tinham falhado em seus deveres, deixando as casas cair em ruínas.<br/><br/>O Sr. H.R. Williams, o fideicomissário que havia escrito ao jornal antes, disse que ele tinha a melhor autoridade de que os comissários da Igreja não fariam nenhuma estrada e eles não seriam beneficiados nem um pouco pelas ações dos comissários de caridade. Outros foram muito menos confiantes e a reunião foi encerrada após quase três horas.<br/><br/>"Nós somos confrontados com o fato de que em Highgate e Muswell Hill há um número de pessoas que querem o cemitério Bottom Wood e não será feliz até que eles têm-lo - enquanto ninguém parece disposto a gastar um centavo para pagar por isso. Todo mundo diz que seria uma coisa boa ter a madeira como espaço aberto, mas todo mundo acha que é o dever de outra pessoa para torná-lo um. O Islington Vestry "resolveu" o assunto, mas o Islington Vestry não oferece um centavo para a compra. Não há problema mais difícil para a comunidade ou o indivíduo resolver do que como obter a posse da propriedade de outras pessoas sem pagar por ela.<br/><br/>Pagar por isso foi de fato o problema, pois o Churchyard Bottom Wood tornou-se objeto de intenso debate local e nacional. Um comitê conjunto foi formado para arrecadar dinheiro para salvar a madeira. Em 20 de novembro de 1896, C.F. Cory-Wright, Hon Tesoureiro, escreveu para o The Standard, um jornal diário na época, pedindo ajuda. Ele lembrou a todos o perigo de perder a madeira e disse que só poderia ser salvo comprando-o. Os comissários da Igreja venderiam por £ 25.000 e um extra (5.000 seriam necessários para vedação e drenagem, fazendo um total de £ 30.000. Isso era demais para o Conselho de Hornsey levantar, mas eles já haviam votado £ 10.000 para o total. As florestas eram de valor inestimável para todo o norte de Londres, então ele apelou para órgãos públicos e pessoas privadas para levantar o restante £ 20.000. Ele alertou que a presente oferta dos comissários da Igreja estava aberta apenas até o final de 1898. Depois disso, os construtores se mudariam.<br/><br/>O apelo foi calorosamente recebido pela imprensa. Um projeto de lei privado foi apressado através do Parlamento e o Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, tornou-se lei. O Conunittee agora tinha o direito de anunciar contribuições para a compra da madeira e preservá-lo.<br/><br/>Em pouco tempo, quase todo o dinheiro foi angariado, mas os últimos milhares de euros revelaram-se muito difíceis de angariar e o prazo fixado pelos Comissários estava a poucas semanas de distância. O Sr. Cory-Wright escreveu pedindo mais tempo, mas foi concedido um mero três meses e, em seguida, apenas se os juros de 4% foram pagos para o período extra sobre o montante total. No final, o Conselho do Condado de Londres, que originalmente ofereceu £ 2.500, fez isso até £ 5.000 e o total foi alcançado, mas foi uma coisa de perto.<br/><br/>O Conselho decidiu renomear a madeira como "Queen's Woods" em homenagem ao Jubileu de Diamante da Rainha Vitória e Hornsey colocou em uma bela exibição de bunting quando a Duquesa de Albany declarou formalmente a madeira aberta "para o uso gratuito do público para sempre".<br/><br/>Enquanto a campanha para salvar Churchyard Bottom Wood era dirigida e dirigida por pessoas locais que se sentiam apaixonadas por esse pedaço de floresta em particular, eles pediram a ajuda e a experiência de uma vasta rede de pessoas, algumas das quais trabalharam juntas em campanhas semelhantes por mais de trinta anos. O Comitê emitiu um apelo, impresso em papel de muito boa qualidade e com alguns nomes famosos.<br/><br/>As questões de espaço aberto e saúde pública foram temas importantes da visão vitoriana.<br/><br/>O Movimento Espaços Abertos<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, a grande reformadora da habitação, que tinha começado com três casas antigas em Marylebone, compradas por Jolm Ruskin, rapidamente se tornou uma especialista em abrigar pessoas pobres nas condições mais saudáveis possíveis. Sua maneira era comprar arrendamentos e depois derrubar algumas das casas lotadas, a fim de trazer luz e ar para o resto, acreditando que o ar fresco e a luz do sol eram a única maneira de salvar as pessoas pobres da febre pútrida. Ela havia aprendido isso quando criança de seu avô, Southwood Smith, que desenvolveu suas teorias no Hospital Fever em King's Cross.<br/><br/>Ele construiu as primeiras Moradias Industriais para pessoas pobres e provou estatisticamente que um bom ar e uma drenagem decente salvaram vidas. Gibson Gardens, em Northwold Road, é um resultado direto das ideias da Southwood Smith. Mais informações sobre Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>A importância do ar livre<br/><br/>Espaços abertos e a oportunidade de respirar ar puro, eram essenciais para as pessoas que viviam em um ou dois quartos lotados. Octavia Hill levou suas acusações das favelas Lisson Grove, até Fitzjohn's Avenue até Hampstead Heath. Ela amava tanto os campos da Avenida Fitzjohn que tentou comprá-los como um parque público. Eles iriam custar £ 10.000 e dentro de três semanas de agosto £ 8.500 tinham sido levantados. Necessitava apenas do fim das férias de verão e do retorno das férias de amigos simpáticos e as outras £ 1.500 teriam sido levantadas, mas os proprietários de repente retiraram sua oferta. Apesar de todas as súplicas, os campos estavam cobertos de grandes casas.<br/><br/>A partir disso, desenvolveu-se a campanha para salvar Parliament Hill, o próximo espaço aberto para o norte de Lisson Grove, comprando campos no caminho dos construtores para fazer um cordão sanitário permanente contra os tijolos que avançavam. A campanha de Parliament Hill Fields foi tão bem sucedida que o Hampstead Heath Bill foi aprovado e havia dinheiro sobrando do apelo. A partir desse dinheiro e do ímpeto em direção a espaços abertos, foi para desenvolver o National Trust. Octavia Hill estava interessada em proteger áreas como Church Bottom Wood há anos, então ela era uma aliada natural na luta para salvar a madeira.<br/><br/>A Sociedade de Preservação dos Comuns também estava familiarizada com esse tipo de agitação e arrecadação de dinheiro. Eles tinham derrubado cercas quando os senhores da mansão tinham fechado pedaços de terra comum, liderando batalhas legais e ilegais contra a privatização arrogante da terra tradicionalmente livre. Robert Hunter, seu advogado honorário de 1868, sempre se preocupou em garantir espaços abertos, grandes ou pequenos, para o público. Ele, agora Sir Robert Hunter, tornou-se o presidente do Church Bottom Appeal. O presidente da Sociedade de Preservação dos Comuns foi o Sr. Shaw-Lefevre MP (mais tarde Lord Eversley) que desempenhou um grande papel nesta e outras campanhas na Câmara dos Comuns. Octavia Hill tinha sido envolvido em seu trabalho desde cerca de 1875.<br/><br/>Ao mesmo tempo, Octavia Hill estava fazendo campanha para um projeto de lei de enterros.<br/><br/>Os cemitérios da cidade haviam-se tornado tão cheios e um perigo tão sério para a saúde, contaminando poços dos quais as pessoas tiravam sua água potável, que os enterros da cidade não eram mais permitidos. Em vez disso, cemitérios foram criados nos arredores da cidade. Abney Park Cemetery foi um deles. Houve então um movimento para remover as lápides para as bordas dos cemitérios da cidade velha, re-interrar os corpos em outro lugar e transformar os cemitérios em jardins e espaços abertos, em vez de construir sobre eles. Esta terra no centro de Londres era muito valiosa e os especuladores estavam ávidos por obtê-la: até mesmo os Quakers tinham construído sobre um de seus cemitérios e ameaçaram fazê-lo novamente construindo sobre Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill tinha uma rede de aliados em uma dúzia de campos, então sua ajuda para salvar a Church Bottom Wood deve ter sido inestimável.<br/><br/>A Metropolitan Gardens Society, criada em 1882, tinha cerca de duzentos pequenos jardins nos centros das cidades em 1890. Mais tarde, eles os entregaram às autoridades locais, de modo que seu apoio ao apelo de madeira inferior do cemitério foi assegurado desde o início.<br/><br/>A Sociedade Kyrle é esquecida agora, mas em seu dia teve grande influência sobre o Planejamento Urbano e a legislação do Espaço Aberto. A Sociedade foi criada por volta de 1875 para "difusão da beleza", para trazer cor e interesse na vida das pessoas que vivem em um ambiente maçante e sombrio. Cor brilhante para paredes e decoração, bom canto, espaços abertos, Natureza, Literatura e Arte. Havia um Ramo Decorativo, para quem William Morris dava palestras; um Ramo Musical para promover coros e Boas Noites para as pessoas em edifícios escolares locais; e um Ramo de Literatura. A Sociedade apelou regularmente por cartas no The Times, às "classes mais ricas" para que livros e periódicos fossem distribuídos para clubes de meninos e meninas, casas de esmola e em outros lugares. O próprio nome "Kyrle" veio do Papa O Homem de Ross, o filantropo que deu seu lugar de nascimento ao povo como um parque público. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it.

I really enjoyed seei... | Com o Dia de Ação de Graças ao virar da esquina, aqui estão alguns jogos de pasta de arquivos festivos que fizemos para as meninas. Ambos os jogos de Ação de Graças se concentram em habilidades matemáticas. E sou grato mais uma vez ao meu marido, Ed, por fazer toda a clipart para mim.<br/><br/>Ação de Graças Pattern Making<br/><br/>Como o nome diz, este jogo é sobre fazer padrões. Pequenos apenas aprendendo sobre padrões, podem simplesmente combinar as imagens nas tiras de padrão, enquanto outros podem continuar o padrão com os cartões de imagem nas tiras em branco.<br/><br/>Para fazer a pasta de arquivos, você deseja cortar a grade de imagens para fazer os pedaços de cartão. Eu recomendo laminar-los para ajudá-los a durar mais. Em seguida, cole as tiras de padrão para baixo na pasta de arquivos.<br/><br/>Eu queria ter as tiras de padrão em branco também para que as meninas pudessem ver onde continuar o padrão e quantos colocar para fora. Eu os anexei ao lado da pasta usando fita adesiva para que eles pudessem dobrar para embalar o jogo e estender para o layout do padrão.<br/><br/>Eu também adicionei um extra em branco para que as meninas pudessem fazer seu próprio padrão também.<br/><br/>Jogo de números da Turquia<br/><br/>Neste jogo as meninas adicionam as penas ao corpo do peru enquanto praticam a contagem e o reconhecimento de números. Eu usei as penas incolores para atuar como um guia para onde adicionar as penas e para que as meninas pudessem combinar os números. E certifique-se de que, ao colar o corpo do peru, você só cola no centro para que os pedaços de asa possam deslizar sob o corpo.<br/><br/>Uma vez que todas as penas estão dispostas, praticamos alguma aritmética simples, como tirar três penas e ver quantas são deixadas, em seguida, adicionar duas de volta para ver o que é igual.<br/><br/>Além de asas em preto e branco, também incluímos um peru incolor no caso de você querer que os pequenos colorirem seu próprio conjunto. Em vez de um jogo de pasta de arquivos, você pode transformar isso em um ofício, colorindo as peças, cortando-as e colando-as juntas.<br/><br/>Outra opção é usar as peças para fazer uma história de tabuleiro de feltro. Às vezes cantamos uma versão de peru de 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Assim:<br/><br/>Quem sou eu?<br/><br/>Acho que é aqui que devo dizer algo espirituoso sobre mim. Sou uma mãe que fica em casa para três crianças incríveis - nossas filhas gêmeas que têm sete anos agora e um filho de dois anos que está cheio de energia. Na minha vida pré-infantil eu era um professor e agora eu ensino em casa nossos filhos. Eu também sou casado com Ed, que atualmente está servindo na Força Aérea, e é o amor da minha vida (seria estranho se ele não fosse). Nossa família é grande em livros, artesanato e se divertindo juntos. Eu só pensei em compartilhar nossas atividades no meu próprio pequeno canto da internet.<br/><br/>Zoe parece ter tudo - marido rico e bonito, vida fácil em Nova York - mas ela cometeu erros em seu passado e esses erros estão voltando em sua nova vida. Eu me encontrei na borda do meu assento durante a maior parte do livro e fiquei surpreso...<br/><br/>Eu amei este livro, eu amo a história, e eu sou grato Margot Shetterly trouxe à luz. Minha única reclamação foi que eu gostaria que ela discutisse o papel de Katherine Johnson nas missões posteriores um pouco mais, mas eu acho que a história tinha que terminar como...<br/><br/>Eu queria gostar deste livro e eu fiz ao longo da maior parte dele.

| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | O uso de álcool por pessoas com menos de 21 anos tem sido identificado como um grande problema de saúde pública. Estudos observam que aumenta os riscos para a incapacidade e pode ser prejudicial para o cérebro em desenvolvimento. Menores que bebem são mais propensos a cometer suicídio, violar a lei ou ser vítimas de violência. O álcool está implicado em quase um terço das mortes no trânsito de jovens. O custo total anual de beber menores de idade é estimado em US $ 62 bilhões. Embora a maioria das leis destinadas a evitar o consumo de álcool por menores de idade sejam aprovadas no nível estadual, houve atividade legislativa e interesse no nível federal para apoiar os esforços dos estados para conter o problema. Este relatório descreve a extensão do consumo de álcool por menores de idade, as recentes actividades legislativas sobre esta questão e várias implicações políticas. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives?

Não foi o lobby político ou petições públicas que resultou na reforma alimentar, mas sim um esforço de base liderado por cidadãos com o poder de realmente implementar e acompanhar a mudança.<br/><br/>Encerrei o post aludindo a uma pergunta: por que é tão difícil para nós fazermos isso nós mesmos, como indivíduos? Se um país inteiro pode implementar e espalhar uma visão comum em relação à comida, por que não podemos?<br/><br/>Não há nada que realmente nos impeça de imitar o sucesso da Dinamarca. O problema é que estamos inundados com tantas mensagens sobre o que devemos comer e como devemos viver, é difícil saber por onde começar. Então, em vez de seguir estruturas bem-sucedidas que mostraram funcionar (como o Nordic Food Manifesto), a maioria das pessoas salta da mania da dieta para a mania da dieta, tentando encontrar a "maneira certa de comer".<br/><br/>Mas como Claus Meyer teve sucesso? Qual foi o molho secreto que ajudou o Manifesto a tomar posse? E é razoável pensar que podemos aplicar essas lições às nossas próprias vidas?
