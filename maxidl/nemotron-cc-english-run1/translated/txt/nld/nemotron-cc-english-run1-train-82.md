In simple terms, the condition is characterized by: one develops a kidney disease and undergoes a kidney transplant and other diseases associated with acidic concentration in the blood and gout. In theory, the condition will occur even if the genetic change is inherited from one parent and sporadically occurs when there is no family history.<br/><br/>Common names of autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>The condition has other names as well namely: medullary cystic kidney disease, although this name is not used as much because most people suffering from this condition do not have medullary cysts. It is also referred to as juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy. The disease tends to affect people of ages 20 to 50. The latter condition as aforementioned occurs in young children, something, which translate to get it from both parents.<br/>Cystic kidney disease is an inherited condition whereby the cysts in the centre of each kidney gradually lose their ability to function properly. Cysts refer to abnormal blisters of fluid in the kidney. The condition further scares the kidney making unable to concentrate the urine and as a result, producing too much urine. Its symptoms include excessive urination, salt cravings, weakness, confusion, bleeding, fatigue, frequent hiccups, low blood pressure, nausea and vomiting, headaches, pale skin, reduced sensation in the hands, weight loss among many others. Other complications include: anemia, ulcers, loss of bone density, infertility and other heart related problems.<br/>Its analysis incorporates blood tests to check for sodium levels and general kidney functions, urine tests to check the levels of concentration and other imbalances, x rays to check for the size of kidneys that may be altered owing to increased urine concentrations, renal biopsy and genetic testing to verify any genetic changes that might have taken place in due time.<br/>While the disease does not have a cut and dry treatment to it, one may focus on controlling measures, which include intake of fluids and salt to supplement the one lost as the disease progresses into latter stages. This also helps reduce dehydration. Other treatments include taking of prescribed medication and diet changes and minimal intakes of foods containing phosphorous and potassium. Further complications may also require one to have a kidney transplant. Basically, this is not a curable disease but rather a manageable once detected in the early stages.<br/><br/>The common yet different factor of Autosomal dominant interstitial kidney disease<br/><br/>Nephronophthisis and medullary cystic kidney disease are mainly grouped together because, in essence, they share the same features but with a slight difference in regards inheritance patterns to the former affecting children and the latter affecting young adults and older age groups. Similar features for both are ADH resistant urine concentration that leads to polyuria and polydipsia, anemia and renal diseases.<br/>The former aforementioned condition is Autosomal recessive accounting to 15% of chronic diseases and causes ESRD during early childhood while the latter is Autosomal dominant with a few sporadic new mutations and causes ESRD for people between the ages of 30 and 50. | Online CPR-certificering Blog<br/><br/>Datum: juli 23rd, 2014<br/><br/>Autosomaal dominante interstitiële nierziekte is een zeldzame verzameling ziekten die de bekende functies van de nier beïnvloeden. In eenvoudige termen wordt de aandoening gekenmerkt door: men ontwikkelt een nierziekte en ondergaat een niertransplantatie en andere ziekten die verband houden met zure concentratie in het bloed en jicht. In theorie zal de aandoening optreden, zelfs als de genetische verandering wordt geërfd van een ouder en sporadisch optreedt wanneer er geen familiegeschiedenis.<br/><br/>Gemeenschappelijke namen van autosomale dominante interstitiële nierziekte<br/><br/>De aandoening heeft ook andere namen, namelijk: medullaire cystische nierziekte, hoewel deze naam niet zo veel wordt gebruikt omdat de meeste mensen die aan deze aandoening lijden, geen medullaire cysten hebben. Het wordt ook wel juveniele hyperuricemic nefropathie genoemd. De ziekte heeft de neiging om mensen van 20 tot 50 jaar te treffen. De laatste aandoening zoals hierboven vermeld, komt voor bij jonge kinderen, iets dat vertaalt naar het krijgen van beide ouders.<br/>Cystische nierziekte is een erfelijke aandoening waarbij de cysten in het centrum van elke nier geleidelijk hun vermogen om goed te functioneren verliezen. Cysten verwijzen naar abnormale blaren van vocht in de nier. De aandoening schrikt de nier verder af, waardoor de urine niet kan worden geconcentreerd en daardoor te veel urine wordt geproduceerd. De symptomen zijn onder meer overmatig urineren, zout hunkeren, zwakte, verwarring, bloeden, vermoeidheid, frequente hik, lage bloeddruk, misselijkheid en braken, hoofdpijn, bleke huid, verminderd gevoel in de handen, gewichtsverlies onder vele anderen. Andere complicaties zijn: bloedarmoede, zweren, verlies van botdichtheid, onvruchtbaarheid en andere hartgerelateerde problemen.<br/>De analyse omvat bloedtests om natriumniveaus en algemene nierfuncties te controleren, urinetests om de concentratieniveaus en andere onevenwichtigheden te controleren, röntgenstralen om de grootte van de nieren te controleren die kunnen worden gewijzigd als gevolg van verhoogde urineconcentraties, nierbiopsie en genetische tests om eventuele genetische veranderingen te verifiëren die op tijd zouden hebben plaatsgevonden.<br/>Hoewel de ziekte geen snij- en droge behandeling heeft, kan men zich richten op het beheersen van maatregelen, waaronder de inname van vloeistoffen en zout om de verloren persoon aan te vullen naarmate de ziekte in de latere stadia vordert. Dit helpt ook om uitdroging te verminderen. Andere behandelingen omvatten het nemen van voorgeschreven medicatie en dieetveranderingen en minimale inname van voedingsmiddelen die fosfor en kalium bevatten. Verdere complicaties kunnen ook een niertransplantatie vereisen. Kortom, dit is geen genezende ziekte, maar eerder een beheersbare eens ontdekt in de vroege stadia.<br/><br/>De gemeenschappelijke maar verschillende factor van autosomaal dominante interstitiële nierziekte<br/><br/>Nefronofthisis en medullaire cystische nierziekte zijn voornamelijk gegroepeerd omdat ze in wezen dezelfde kenmerken delen, maar met een klein verschil wat betreft erfelijkheidspatronen ten opzichte van de eerste kinderen die van invloed zijn en de laatste die van invloed zijn op jonge volwassenen en oudere leeftijdsgroepen. Vergelijkbare kenmerken voor beide zijn ADH-resistente urineconcentratie die leidt tot polyurie en polydipsie, anemie en nierziekten.<br/>De eerder genoemde aandoening is autosomaal recessief, dat 15% van de chronische ziekten vertegenwoordigt en ESRD veroorzaakt tijdens de vroege kindertijd, terwijl de laatste autosomaal dominant is met een paar sporadische nieuwe mutaties en ESRD veroorzaakt voor mensen tussen de 30 en 50 jaar. |
| Hobbes' vs. Locke's Account on the State of Nature<br/><br/>Topic: PhilosophyWords: 2539Pages: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes and Locke are among the most influential political philosophers to ever write in English. The state of nature, which precedes the organization of the complex societies, is the common premise that both Hobbes and Locke share but interpret in different ways. The former views humans in their natural state as equally dangerous and free to pursue their egoistic goals unrestricted by the nonexistent notions of justice, which is why his natural state amounts to the "war of every man against every man" (Hobbes76). The latter, on the other hand, views humans in their original condition as equally valuable and restricts natural freedom by the idea of justice that requires not to harm others, which allows defining the state of nature as "mutual assistance and preservation" rather than war (Locke 15). The key difference between the two philosophers' accounts of natural state is that Locke uses ethical considerations while Hobbes does not, and it ultimately leads Hobbes to envisage a state exercising unlimited power over human beings, while Locke limits the government by the moral principles, which he considers a natural law.<br/><br/>Hobbes bases his assumptions regarding the state of nature on the fact that all people are roughly equal in their physical and mental capabilities. He admits that some individuals may demonstrate greater physical strength or superior intellect but insists that "when all is reckoned together, the difference between man and man is not so considerable" (Hobbes 74). Since humans are roughly equal in their capabilities, they also have similar hopes to attain their ends and satisfy their needs (Hobbes 75). As a logical outcome of this equality, when the people begin competing for scarce resources, no one may feel entirely secure in his or her possessions. Even if a mighty, cunning, and capable person succeeds in subjugating "the persons of all men he can," it still does not guarantee the ultimate security (Hobbes 75). As no human can obtain such superiority over the others that renders him or her utterly immune to their strength of intellect, no human can feel completely safe when surrounded by his or her equals. Hobbes' equality in the natural state is equality of fear, where all humans view each other as dangerous competitors.<br/><br/>Just as Hobbes, Locke considers all human beings to be fundamentally equal, but assigns a very different meaning to the term. From his perspective, it is not the equality of capabilities, but, rather, the equality of value. He opines that the people "promiscuously born to all the same advantages of nature" should logically enjoy the perfect equality among them, as there is no reason to consider anyone inherently more valuable (Locke 8). The only possible foundation for designating some people as superior to others would be if God "by any manifest declaration of his will, set one above another" (Locke 8). Since such divine sanction of superiority is absent, Locke concludes that the natural equality of all representatives of humankind is not to be called into question. Hobbes approaches equality pragmatically and stresses that people in their natural state are equally dangerous, but Locke employs an ethical approach and emphasizes that humans are equally valuable in God's eyes. This disagreement is but the first difference between the two authors based on the fact that Locke includes God as a premise into his political philosophy, while Hobbes does not.<br/><br/>Another characteristic feature of Hobbes' account of the natural state is his interpretation of liberty. According to Hobbes, the state of nature implies unlimited freedom to do whatever is necessary for one's continued existence. The philosopher defines liberty as "the absence of external impediments" in using one's abilities to attain one's goals (Hobbes 79). The primary purpose of every sentient being is to maintain its continued existence. As a consequence, Hobbesian freedom amounts to the unhindered opportunity to do anything that, in one's judgment, would be best suited to preserve one's life and possessions (Hobbes 79). The only limitation to liberty is that a person cannot do anything contradictory to sustaining his or her life or destroying "the means of preserving the same" (Hobbes 79). Apart from that, there are no boundaries, and everyone has "a right to everything, even to one another's body" if that furthers one's survival (Hobbes 80). Thus, natural liberty, as viewed by Hobbes, is the absence of externally enforced obstacles in pursuing one's right to everything to sustain and secure one's continued existence.<br/><br/>Locke also upholds the idea of natural liberty but, unsurprisingly, approaches it in a manner that is significantly different from that of Hobbes. As soon as he begins discussing liberty in the state of nature, he immediately notes that a state of freedom does not equate "a state of license" (Locke 9). The philosopher identifies two specific limitations to human freedom in the state of nature. The first one is identical to that introduce by Hobbes: however free and independent, a person nevertheless "has not liberty to destroy himself" (Locke 9). Yet the second limitation contradicts Hobbes' prepositions directly. According to Locke, every human being has a natural obligation not to "harm another in his life, health, liberty, or possessions" (9). Just as with his interpretation of equality, the author bases this assertion on ethical and religious grounds: people should preserve each other's existence since they are all creations of the same "omnipotent, and infinitely wise maker" (Locke 9). Thus, Locke's limits liberty in the natural state far more stringently than Hobbes by introducing the obligation to refrain from harming both oneself and the others.<br/><br/>The differences between the two authors also manifest in their accounts of justice in the natural state of humanity. As far as Hobbes is concerned, delineating just and unjust practices is merely the matter of the law. There is no jurisprudence in the state of nature, and the only law governing human beings in their original condition is a natural law that only obliges them to seek personal security. As a result, nothing can be unjust in the original state of the humankind: "notions of right and wrong justice and injustice" have no place and no meaning in the absence of the stringently enforced law (Hobbes 78). As long as the people use their virtually unlimited freedom to ruthlessly compete with each other for resources, to which they are equally entitled, they have no criteria to differentiate between just and unjust actions. Therefore, the Hobbesian state of nature defies the very idea of justice since the author interprets it as a mere function of the formalized and established law.<br/><br/>Locke assigns different meaning to justice and views it not so much in legislative as in the ethical terms. This paper already mentioned that, unlike Hobbes, Locke employs ethical notions and generally bases his political philosophy on moral rather than purely practical presumptions. Locke's natural law, unlike that of Hobbes, obliges human beings to take care of each other rather than simply leaving everyone to fend for themselves. As a result, there is a place for justice and injustice in his state of nature. The author points to this fact himself when noting that no one should deprive another of his or her life of the means of preserving it "unless it be to do justice on an offender" (Locke 9). This statement reveals with the utmost clarity that, according to Locke, there is justice in the state of nature, and, moreover, humans have to preserve it actively. The criterion of justice, which Hobbes' natural state lacks, is the second limitation on natural liberty imposed by Locke: an action is unjust if it constitutes an unwarranted threat to another person's life and possessions.<br/><br/>These differences in the two authors' treatment of equality, liberty, and justice or injustice culminate in their interpretation of the relationship between the state of nature and the state of war. From Hobbes's perspective, the two are synonymous, because the ruthless competition is the only logical outcome of putting people with equivalent capabilities and similar needs in an environment with limited resources. He states this connection outright: "if any two men desire the same thing, which nevertheless they cannot both enjoy, they become enemies" and are, therefore, in the state of war with each other (Hobbes 75). Yet since humans are numerous and all possess similar capabilities and needs, this competition manifests not only in the individual interactions but also on the level of humanity as a whole. As long as all humans have equal and unlimited rights to all resources and even to each other's bodies and lives, the state of nature is a war of "every man against every man" (Hobbes 76). This grim interpretation stems directly from Hobbes' portrayal of the state of nature as governed solely by the individuals' egoistic urges.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, differentiates between the state of nature and the state of war and points out that, while they may occur simultaneously, it is no reason to identify one with the other. Locke's definition of the state of war is virtually identical to that offered by Hobbes. According to Locke, "he who attempts to get another man into his absolute power does thereby put himself into a state of war with him" (14). This explanation lines up perfectly with the Hobbesian notion that everyone's universal right to everything, including the other people's bodies and lives, leads to the state of war. Yet Locke refuses to equate the state of war and the state of nature precisely because he denies Hobbes' interpretation of natural freedom. Since Locke's natural state restrains people from harming each other through the second limitation of liberty, an attempt on another person's freedom is a transgression against the natural law. While for Hobbes, war is the humankind's condition by default, Locke portrays it as a perversion of the state of nature rather than its rule.<br/><br/>These differences in delineating the state on nature and its constituents, such as liberty, equality, justice, and war, pave the way to the authors contrasting portrayals of government. Based on his pessimistic assessment of the state of nature, the author of Leviathan concludes that, under conditions of war, there can be no definite hope for "living out the time which nature ordinarily alloweth men to live" (Hobbes 80). The solution is laying down the universal right to everything and leaving everyone "so much liberty against other men, as he would allow other men against himself" (Hobbes 80). The participants of the resulting social contract invest the unlimited liberties they have surrendered into a sovereign – the bearer of the supreme power whose purpose is to preserve the achieved status quo by punishing all transgressions against it. Sovereign's power is absolute: the ruler has the authority "to do whatsoever he shall think necessary" to promote peace between his subjects so that no one would assail another's life or property (113). Hobbes concludes that without such an unassailable figure entitled with the right to do anything to the subjects, there can be no peace and no guarantee of security.<br/><br/>While Locke agrees with the necessity of creating politically organized societies, he nevertheless opposes Hobbes' idea of the sovereign power as unlimited and unassailable. As mentioned above, Locke's state of nature is not nearly as dreadful as that painted by Hobbes because of the people's obligation to preserve not only themselves but each other as well. Therefore, the need for social contract arises not from the fear of the others, but from the sheer convenience. Small communities may not need numerous laws to solve conflicts and "officers to superintend the process," but larger associations find it advisable to institute governments for that purpose (Locke 57). Yet the power of the government cannot be unlimited because it would result in subduing the subjects to an "inconstant, uncertain, unknown, arbitrary will of another man" (Locke 17). Such a government would constitute a twofold violation of the natural law. By agreeing to another person's absolute power over his life, a subject would violate its first limitation prohibiting to harm oneself. As for the ruler, destroying another person's liberty would constitute direct harm and, as such, be contradictory to the second limitation.<br/><br/>As a direct continuation of his case for unlimited governmental authority, Hobbes denies the separation of powers as a principle. From his perspective, the sovereign, once instituted, possesses "the whole power of prescribing the rules" governing the lives of the subjects or, in shorter terms, the legislative power (Hobbes 114). The sovereign also reserves the right of "hearing and deciding all controversies" – that is, the judicial power (Hobbes 114). Finally, since the entire purpose of the sovereign is to force the subjects to refrain from harming each other, there can be no doubt that executive power is also his or her exclusive prerogative. The separation of powers as a concept is alien to Hobbes because of his views on the state of nature. Creating a political entity where the executive, legislative, and judicial branches would check each other – that is, compete – would mean recreating the Hobbesian state of nature-as-war on a higher level. Since the people enter a social contract and institute a government to put the state of nature behind them, not reinstate it in a different form, the separation of powers contradictory Hobbes' views directly.<br/><br/>Locke, on the other hand, embraces separation of power as a foundational principle of his political theory. His case for the separation is evident in the discussion of the limits of the legislative power. As Locke puts it, it would be hardly advisable "for the same persons, who have the power of making laws, to have also in their hands the power to execute them" (76). The philosopher points to the imperfections of human nature and the inherent desire to "grasp at power" as a rationale for this precautionary measure (Locke 76). Just as in Hobbes' case, Locke's account of the separation of powers stems directly from his interpretation of the state of nature. If there is already justice in the state of nature and the people can understand it, any government is inevitably subject to the same natural law. Since absolute power over people violates both limitations of this law, separating and distributing it is advisable so that the government would function appropriately.<br/><br/>This paper has demonstrated that, while the differences between Hobbes' and Locke's accounts of the natural state of humanity are numerous, they ultimately amount to the presence of absence of moral premises. Hobbes views the natural state as that of unlimited liberty, where people endowed with equal capabilities and not bound by any moral notions, such as justice, compete for the resources unceasingly. Locke, however, interprets equality and liberty ethically rather than practically and opines that war is a perversion of the natural state, as the natural law obliges humans not to harm each other. This disagreement influences the philosophers' approaches to government. Hobbes insists on an all-powerful ruler, as, in the absence of ethical restraints, no other authority could force the humans to refrain from harming each other. Yet, in Locke's view, granting the government unlimited powers would be contradictory to the ethical limitations embedded in the law of nature, which is why he, unlike Hobbes, advocates separation of powers. | Hobbes' vs. Locke's account over de staat van de natuur<br/><br/>Thema: FilosofieWords: 2539Pagina's: 9Aug 3rd, 2021<br/><br/>Hobbes en Locke behoren tot de meest invloedrijke politieke filosofen die ooit in het Engels hebben geschreven. De staat van de natuur, die voorafgaat aan de organisatie van de complexe samenlevingen, is het gemeenschappelijke uitgangspunt dat zowel Hobbes als Locke delen, maar op verschillende manieren interpreteren. De eersten beschouwen de mensen in hun natuurlijke staat als even gevaarlijk en vrij om hun egoïstische doelen na te streven, ongehinderd door de niet-bestaande begrippen van rechtvaardigheid, en daarom komt zijn natuurlijke staat neer op de “oorlog van ieder mens tegen ieder mens” (Hobbes 76). De laatste daarentegen beschouwt de mens in zijn oorspronkelijke toestand als even waardevol en beperkt de natuurlijke vrijheid door het idee van rechtvaardigheid dat vereist dat anderen geen schade berokkenen, wat het mogelijk maakt om de staat van de natuur te definiëren als "wederzijdse bijstand en behoud" in plaats van oorlog (Lock 15). Het belangrijkste verschil tussen de twee filosofen 'rekeningen van de natuurlijke staat is dat Locke ethische overwegingen gebruikt, terwijl Hobbes dat niet doet, en het uiteindelijk leidt Hobbes om een staat te overwegen die onbeperkte macht over mensen uitoefent, terwijl Locke de regering beperkt door de morele principes, die hij als een natuurwet beschouwt.<br/><br/>Hobbes baseert zijn aannames met betrekking tot de staat van de natuur op het feit dat alle mensen ongeveer gelijk zijn in hun fysieke en mentale capaciteiten. Hij geeft toe dat sommige individuen grotere fysieke kracht of superieur intellect kunnen aantonen, maar dringt erop aan dat “wanneer alles bij elkaar wordt gerekend, het verschil tussen mens en mens niet zo groot is” (Hobbes 74). Omdat mensen ongeveer gelijk zijn in hun vermogens, hebben ze ook dezelfde hoop om hun doelen te bereiken en hun behoeften te bevredigen (Hobbes 75). Als logische uitkomst van deze gelijkheid, wanneer de mensen beginnen te concurreren voor schaarse middelen, kan niemand zich volledig veilig voelen in zijn of haar bezittingen. Zelfs als een machtig, sluw en bekwaam persoon erin slaagt "de personen van alle mensen die hij kan" te onderwerpen, garandeert het nog steeds niet de ultieme veiligheid (Hobbes 75). Aangezien geen mens zo’n superioriteit over de anderen kan verkrijgen dat hij of zij volkomen immuun is voor hun kracht van intellect, kan geen mens zich volledig veilig voelen wanneer hij of zij omringd is door zijn of haar gelijken. Hobbes gelijkheid in de natuurlijke staat is gelijkheid van angst, waar alle mensen elkaar zien als gevaarlijke concurrenten.<br/><br/>Net als Hobbes beschouwt Locke alle mensen als fundamenteel gelijk, maar kent hij de term een heel andere betekenis toe. Vanuit zijn perspectief is het niet de gelijkheid van vermogens, maar eerder de gelijkheid van waarde. Hij is van mening dat de mensen “die veelbelovend zijn geboren voor alle voordelen van de natuur” logischerwijs de volmaakte gelijkheid onder hen moeten genieten, omdat er geen reden is om iemand van nature waardevoller te beschouwen (Locke 8). De enige mogelijke basis voor het aanwijzen van sommige mensen als superieur aan anderen zou zijn als God “door een openlijke verklaring van zijn wil de een boven de ander stelt” (Locke 8). Aangezien een dergelijke goddelijke sanctie van superioriteit ontbreekt, concludeert Locke dat de natuurlijke gelijkheid van alle vertegenwoordigers van de mensheid niet in twijfel mag worden getrokken. Hobbes benadert gelijkheid pragmatisch en benadrukt dat mensen in hun natuurlijke staat even gevaarlijk zijn, maar Locke hanteert een ethische benadering en benadrukt dat mensen even waardevol zijn in Gods ogen. Deze onenigheid is slechts het eerste verschil tussen de twee auteurs op basis van het feit dat Locke God als een uitgangspunt in zijn politieke filosofie opneemt, terwijl Hobbes dat niet doet.<br/><br/>Een ander kenmerkend kenmerk van Hobbes' verslag van de natuurlijke staat is zijn interpretatie van vrijheid. Volgens Hobbes impliceert de staat van de natuur onbeperkte vrijheid om te doen wat nodig is voor het voortbestaan van iemand. De filosoof definieert vrijheid als "de afwezigheid van externe belemmeringen" in het gebruik van iemands vermogens om zijn doelen te bereiken (Hobbes 79). Het primaire doel van elk voelend wezen is om zijn voortbestaan te behouden. Als gevolg hiervan, Hobbesian vrijheid komt neer op de ongehinderde mogelijkheid om alles te doen dat, naar eigen oordeel, zou het beste geschikt zijn om iemands leven en bezittingen te behouden (Hobbes 79). De enige beperking van de vrijheid is dat een persoon niets kan doen dat in tegenspraak is met het in stand houden van zijn of haar leven of het vernietigen van "de middelen om hetzelfde te behouden" (Hobbes 79). Afgezien daarvan zijn er geen grenzen, en iedereen heeft “een recht op alles, zelfs op elkaars lichaam” als dat zijn voortbestaan bevordert (Hobbé 80). Zo is natuurlijke vrijheid, zoals Hobbes het ziet, de afwezigheid van van buitenaf afgedwongen belemmeringen bij het nastreven van iemands recht op alles om zijn voortbestaan in stand te houden en veilig te stellen.<br/><br/>Locke handhaaft ook het idee van natuurlijke vrijheid, maar benadert het, niet verwonderlijk, op een manier die aanzienlijk verschilt van die van Hobbes. Zodra hij begint met het bespreken van vrijheid in de staat van de natuur, merkt hij onmiddellijk op dat een staat van vrijheid niet gelijk staat aan "een staat van licentie" (Locke 9). De filosoof identificeert twee specifieke beperkingen aan de menselijke vrijheid in de staat van de natuur. De eerste is identiek aan de inleiding van Hobbes: hoe vrij en onafhankelijk een persoon ook is, hij heeft niettemin "geen vrijheid om zichzelf te vernietigen" (Locke 9). Toch is de tweede beperking in tegenspraak met Hobbes' uitgangspunten. Volgens Locke heeft ieder mens een natuurlijke plicht om “een ander in zijn leven, gezondheid, vrijheid of bezittingen niet te beschadigen”. Net als bij zijn interpretatie van gelijkheid baseert de schrijver deze bewering op ethische en religieuze gronden: de mensen moeten elkaars bestaan behouden, omdat ze allemaal scheppingen zijn van dezelfde "almachtige en oneindig wijze maker" (Locke 9). Zo beperkt Locke's vrijheid in de natuurlijke staat veel strenger dan Hobbes door de verplichting in te voeren om zich te onthouden van schade aan zowel zichzelf als de anderen.<br/><br/>De verschillen tussen de twee auteurs komen ook tot uiting in hun rechtvaardigheidsverslagen in de natuurlijke staat van de mensheid. Wat Hobbes betreft, is het omschrijven van rechtvaardige en onrechtvaardige praktijken louter een zaak van de wet. Er is geen jurisprudentie in de staat van de natuur, en de enige wet die de mens in zijn oorspronkelijke staat regeert, is een natuurwet die hem alleen verplicht om persoonlijke veiligheid te zoeken. Als gevolg hiervan kan niets onrechtvaardig zijn in de oorspronkelijke staat van de mensheid: "begrippen van recht en onrecht rechtvaardigheid en onrecht" hebben geen plaats en geen betekenis in de afwezigheid van de streng afgedwongen wet (Hobbes 78). Zolang de mensen hun nagenoeg onbeperkte vrijheid gebruiken om meedogenloos met elkaar te concurreren om middelen waar ze evenveel recht op hebben, hebben ze geen criteria om onderscheid te maken tussen rechtvaardige en onrechtvaardige daden. Daarom betwist de Hobbesiaanse natuurstaat het idee van rechtvaardigheid, omdat de auteur het interpreteert als een loutere functie van de geformaliseerde en gevestigde wet.<br/><br/>Locke kent een andere betekenis toe aan justitie en beschouwt het niet zozeer in wetgevende termen als in ethische termen. Dit artikel heeft al vermeld dat, in tegenstelling tot Hobbes, Locke ethische begrippen gebruikt en zijn politieke filosofie in het algemeen baseert op morele in plaats van louter praktische veronderstellingen. De natuurwet van Locke, in tegenstelling tot die van Hobbes, verplicht de mens om voor elkaar te zorgen in plaats van iedereen voor zichzelf te laten zorgen. Als gevolg hiervan is er een plaats voor rechtvaardigheid en onrecht in zijn natuurtoestand. De schrijver wijst op dit feit zelf wanneer hij opmerkt dat niemand een ander van zijn of haar leven mag beroven van de middelen om het te behouden "tenzij het is om recht te doen aan een overtreder" (Locke 9). Deze verklaring onthult met de grootste duidelijkheid dat er volgens Locke rechtvaardigheid is in de staat van de natuur, en bovendien moeten de mensen het actief behouden. Het criterium van rechtvaardigheid, dat de natuurlijke staat van Hobbes ontbreekt, is de tweede beperking van de natuurlijke vrijheid opgelegd door Locke: een handeling is onrechtvaardig als het een ongerechtvaardigde bedreiging vormt voor het leven en de bezittingen van een andere persoon.<br/><br/>Deze verschillen in de behandeling van de twee auteurs van gelijkheid, vrijheid en rechtvaardigheid of onrecht culmineren in hun interpretatie van de relatie tussen de staat van de natuur en de staat van oorlog. Vanuit het perspectief van Hobbes zijn de twee synoniem, omdat de meedogenloze concurrentie het enige logische resultaat is van het plaatsen van mensen met gelijkwaardige capaciteiten en vergelijkbare behoeften in een omgeving met beperkte middelen. Hij verklaart dit verband volkomen: “Indien twee mensen hetzelfde verlangen, dat zij niet allebei kunnen genieten, worden zij vijanden” en zijn zij daarom in staat van oorlog met elkaar (Hobbes 75). Maar omdat mensen talrijk zijn en allemaal dezelfde capaciteiten en behoeften bezitten, manifesteert deze competitie zich niet alleen in de individuele interacties, maar ook op het niveau van de mensheid als geheel. Zolang alle mensen gelijke en onbeperkte rechten hebben op alle hulpbronnen en zelfs op elkaars lichamen en levens, is de staat van de natuur een oorlog van “ieder mens tegen ieder mens” (Hobbes 76). Deze grimmige interpretatie komt rechtstreeks voort uit Hobbes' uitbeelding van de staat van de natuur die uitsluitend wordt geregeerd door de egoïstische drang van de individuen.<br/><br/>Locke maakt daarentegen onderscheid tussen de staat van de natuur en de staat van de oorlog en wijst erop dat, hoewel ze tegelijkertijd kunnen plaatsvinden, het geen reden is om de een met de ander te identificeren. Locke's definitie van de staat van oorlog is vrijwel identiek aan die van Hobbes. Volgens Locke, "wie probeert een andere man in zijn absolute macht te krijgen, zet zichzelf daardoor in een staat van oorlog met hem" (14). Deze uitleg sluit perfect aan bij de Hobbesiaanse opvatting dat het universele recht van iedereen op alles, inclusief de lichamen en levens van de andere mensen, leidt tot de staat van oorlog. Toch weigert Locke de staat van oorlog en de staat van de natuur te gelijkstellen juist omdat hij Hobbes' interpretatie van de natuurlijke vrijheid ontkent. Aangezien de natuurlijke staat van Locke mensen ervan weerhoudt elkaar te schaden door de tweede beperking van de vrijheid, is een poging tot de vrijheid van een ander een overtreding van de natuurwet. Terwijl voor Hobbes, oorlog is de toestand van de mensheid standaard, Locke portretteert het als een perversie van de staat van de natuur in plaats van de regel.<br/><br/>Deze verschillen in het afbakenen van de staat op de natuur en haar constituanten, zoals vrijheid, gelijkheid, rechtvaardigheid en oorlog, effenen de weg voor de auteurs contrasterende uitbeeldingen van de overheid. Op basis van zijn pessimistische beoordeling van de staat van de natuur concludeert de schrijver van Leviathan dat er onder oorlogsomstandigheden geen vaste hoop kan zijn om “de tijd te leven die de natuur de mensen gewoonlijk toestaat te leven” (Hobbes 80). De oplossing is om het universele recht op alles vast te leggen en iedereen “zoveel vrijheid te laten tegen andere mensen als hij andere mensen tegen zichzelf zou laten” (Hobbés 80). De deelnemers aan het resulterende sociale contract beleggen de onbeperkte vrijheden die ze hebben overgegeven in een soeverein – de drager van de hoogste macht wiens doel het is om de bereikte status quo te behouden door alle overtredingen ertegen te bestraffen. De macht van de soeverein is absoluut: de heerser heeft het gezag "om te doen wat hij nodig acht" om de vrede tussen zijn onderdanen te bevorderen, zodat niemand het leven of eigendom van een ander zou aanvallen (113). Hobbes concludeert dat zonder een dergelijke onaantastbare figuur met het recht om iets te doen aan de onderdanen, kan er geen vrede en geen garantie van veiligheid.<br/><br/>Terwijl Locke het eens is met de noodzaak om politiek georganiseerde samenlevingen te creëren, is hij niettemin tegen Hobbes' idee van de soevereine macht als onbeperkt en onaantastbaar. Zoals hierboven vermeld, is Locke's natuurtoestand niet bijna zo verschrikkelijk als die geschilderd door Hobbes vanwege de verplichting van de mensen om niet alleen zichzelf, maar ook elkaar te behouden. De behoefte aan een sociaal contract komt dus niet voort uit de angst voor de anderen, maar uit het loutere gemak. Kleine gemeenschappen hebben misschien geen tal van wetten nodig om conflicten op te lossen en "officieren om het proces te begeleiden", maar grotere verenigingen vinden het raadzaam om regeringen voor dat doel in te stellen (Locke 57). Toch kan de macht van de regering niet onbeperkt zijn, omdat zij ertoe zou leiden dat de onderdanen worden onderworpen aan een “onbestendige, onzekere, onbekende, willekeurige wil van een andere mens” (Locke 17). Een dergelijke regering zou een dubbele schending van de natuurwet zijn. Door in te stemmen met de absolute macht van iemand anders over zijn leven, zou een subject zijn eerste beperking schenden die zichzelf verbiedt zichzelf te schaden. Wat de heerser betreft, zou het vernietigen van de vrijheid van een ander persoon rechtstreekse schade berokkenen en als zodanig in strijd zijn met de tweede beperking.<br/><br/>Als directe voortzetting van zijn zaak voor onbeperkte regeringsgezag ontkent Hobbes de scheiding van machten als principe. Vanuit zijn perspectief bezit de soeverein, eens ingesteld, "de volledige macht om de regels voor te schrijven" die het leven van de onderdanen regelen, of, kortom, de wetgevende macht (Hobbes 114). De soeverein behoudt zich ook het recht voor om “alle controverses te horen en te beslissen” – dat wil zeggen, de rechterlijke macht (Hobbes 114). Ten slotte, aangezien het hele doel van de soeverein is om de onderdanen te dwingen elkaar geen kwaad te doen, kan er geen twijfel over bestaan dat de uitvoerende macht ook zijn of haar exclusieve prerogatief is. De scheiding van de machten als concept is vreemd aan Hobbes vanwege zijn opvattingen over de staat van de natuur. Het creëren van een politieke entiteit waar de uitvoerende, wetgevende en gerechtelijke takken elkaar zouden controleren – dat wil zeggen, concurreren – zou betekenen dat de Hobbesiaanse staat van de natuur-als-oorlog op een hoger niveau wordt herscheppen. Aangezien het volk een sociaal contract aangaat en een regering instelt om de staat van de natuur achter zich te plaatsen, niet om deze in een andere vorm te herstellen, is de scheiding van machten direct tegenstrijdig met Hobbes' opvattingen.<br/><br/>Locke, aan de andere kant, omarmt de scheiding van de macht als een fundamenteel principe van zijn politieke theorie. Zijn geval voor de scheiding is duidelijk in de discussie over de grenzen van de wetgevende macht. Zoals Locke het uitdrukt, zou het nauwelijks raadzaam zijn “voor dezelfde personen, die de macht hebben wetten te maken, om ook in hun handen de macht te hebben om ze uit te voeren”(76). De filosoof wijst op de onvolmaaktheden van de menselijke natuur en het inherente verlangen om “aan de macht te grijpen” als een reden voor deze voorzorgsmaatregel (Locke 76). Net als in het geval van Hobbes, komt Locke's verslag van de scheiding der machten rechtstreeks voort uit zijn interpretatie van de staat van de natuur. Als er al rechtvaardigheid is in de staat van de natuur en het volk het kan begrijpen, is elke regering onvermijdelijk onderworpen aan dezelfde natuurwet. Aangezien absolute macht over mensen beide beperkingen van deze wet schendt, is het scheiden en distribueren ervan raadzaam, zodat de overheid naar behoren zou functioneren.<br/><br/>Dit artikel heeft aangetoond dat, hoewel de verschillen tussen Hobbes' en Locke's verslagen van de natuurlijke toestand van de mensheid talrijk zijn, ze uiteindelijk neerkomen op de aanwezigheid van de afwezigheid van morele veronderstellingen. Hobbes beschouwt de natuurlijke staat als die van onbeperkte vrijheid, waar mensen die begiftigd zijn met gelijke capaciteiten en niet gebonden zijn aan enige morele opvattingen, zoals rechtvaardigheid, onophoudelijk strijden om de middelen. Locke interpreteert echter gelijkheid en vrijheid ethisch in plaats van praktisch en denkt dat oorlog een perversie is van de natuurlijke staat, omdat de natuurwet de mensen verplicht elkaar geen kwaad te doen. Hobbes dringt aan op een almachtige heerser, omdat, bij gebrek aan ethische beperkingen, geen ander gezag de mensen zou kunnen dwingen zich te onthouden van elkaar te schaden. Maar volgens Locke zou het verlenen van onbeperkte bevoegdheden aan de regering in strijd zijn met de ethische beperkingen die zijn ingebed in de wet van de natuur, en daarom pleit hij, in tegenstelling tot Hobbes, voor scheiding van machten. |
| Fashion Police: What Game of Thrones threw up<br/><br/>Canadian-French singer Abbas Hasan put blinding effort to outshine all of humanity at Fashion Parade 2014. Nothing wrong with that, except safety is priority and the musician is a health hazard here.<br/><br/>We get he wants to be a star. Sadly, he didn't get the memo where they tell the desperate and the infamous that stardom is a metaphor. You don't have to look like one and literally set our sight ablaze. Also, the All Pakistan Aunty Association has officially lodged a complaint against him. The local market has run dry of fake crystals and sequined monstrosities. They have nothing to wear to their biweekly high teas and they claim he is to blame. Apparently, the outfit is inspired by Game of Thrones. Can he please stick to composing sad songs about his neighbour's dead dog instead of conceptualising outfits? Or maybe it's the trauma of losing the dog, whose death he is clearly not over as he is still wearing its carcass.<br/><br/>The charge sheet Outfit<br/><br/>No one can decide where the outfit begins and where Abbas ends. You stare in fascination, sinking into a deep abyss and wonder why he is wearing leather pants. Whose horse did he kill to steal the saddle draped across his shoulders? Was he in prison right before his red carpet appearance and forgot to take off the chains? How will he survive the synthetic leather and post-sequin rash that is bound to be lethal in such high dosage? Why am I still alive?<br/><br/>Idea<br/><br/>His inspiration was seemingly Game of Thrones, but he eventually ended up looking like he was thrown out of a Viking restaurant. Had he come across any of the characters from the show, he would've been slain in the first five seconds of the first episode.<br/><br/>The mental health or lack thereof: Someone get him to a counsellor ASAP! He seems to be under the assumption that wearing a dead dog means that the only friend he had in his life is still alive. Dear Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Denial is not a river in Egypt<br/><br/>2. Your tortured psyche is not helping your music, so get help<br/><br/>3. Try imaginary friends<br/><br/>Bail out!<br/><br/>All of us at the Fashion Police headquarters are severely traumatised. Abbas is someone we did not enjoy arresting. He is currently in custody and attempting revenge by putting on attires from other fantasy shows. He just glitter glued himself in order to look like Edward Cullen from Twilight. As a public service message and to prevent further nervous breakdowns, we gave him the following examples of men from the red carpet of the same event.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>When in doubt, play it safe. The singer looks like your average uncle at a shaadi. A plain black suit with no accessories, even if it's a tad disproportionate, is workable. Zohaib's look is blended into everything and nothing, and when you don't have a fashion sense or the money to hire a stylist, this is okay. It does not carry the risk of cardiac arrest for fellow attendees at an event. Given Abbas' delicate mental condition, this look is what he should aim for. Always and forever.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>One day, after decades of therapy, Abbas could aspire to wear attire like Ali Zafar's. The dapper summer look is done to near perfection. Ali came really close to looking like a maître d at a French restaurant with his white summer jacket with black lapels, but the shirt saves it, never mind the satin. His pants would have been ridiculous had they not been folded at the ankles. The shoes are what hipster chic happy endings are made of. | Modepolitie: wat Game of Thrones heeft opgeworpen<br/><br/>De Canadees-Franse zanger Abbas Hasan heeft verblindende inspanningen geleverd om de hele mensheid te overtreffen op Fashion Parade 2014. Daar is niets mis mee, behalve veiligheid staat voorop en de muzikant is hier een gezondheidsrisico.<br/><br/>We snappen dat hij een ster wil zijn. Helaas kreeg hij niet de memo waar ze de wanhopigen vertellen en het beruchte dat sterrendom een metafoor is. Je hoeft er niet uit te zien en letterlijk ons zicht in brand te steken. Ook heeft de All Pakistan Aunty Association officieel een klacht tegen hem ingediend. De lokale markt is droog van valse kristallen en paillettenmonstrositeiten. Ze hebben niets te dragen aan hun tweewekelijks hoge thee en ze beweren dat hij de schuld heeft. Blijkbaar is de outfit geïnspireerd door Game of Thrones. Kan hij zich alstublieft houden aan het componeren van trieste liedjes over de dode hond van zijn buurman in plaats van het conceptualiseren van outfits? Of misschien is het het trauma van het verliezen van de hond, wiens dood hij duidelijk niet voorbij is omdat hij nog steeds zijn karkas draagt.<br/><br/>Het oplaadblad Outfit<br/><br/>Niemand kan beslissen waar de outfit begint en waar Abbas eindigt. Je staart in fascinatie, zinkt in een diepe afgrond en vraagt je af waarom hij een leren broek draagt. Wiens paard heeft hij gedood om het zadel te stelen dat over zijn schouders is gedrapeerd? Was hij in de gevangenis vlak voor zijn rode loper verschijning en vergat de kettingen af te trekken? Hoe zal hij de synthetische leder- en post-sequinuitslag overleven die in zo'n hoge dosering dodelijk zal zijn? Waarom leef ik nog?<br/><br/>Ideeën<br/><br/>Zijn inspiratie was blijkbaar Game of Thrones, maar uiteindelijk zag hij eruit alsof hij uit een Vikingrestaurant werd gegooid. Als hij een van de personages uit de show zou tegenkomen, zou hij in de eerste vijf seconden van de eerste aflevering zijn gedood.<br/><br/>De geestelijke gezondheid of gebrek daaraan: Iemand brengt hem zo snel mogelijk naar een adviseur! Hij lijkt onder de veronderstelling te zijn dat het dragen van een dode hond betekent dat de enige vriend die hij in zijn leven had nog in leven is. Beste Abbas:<br/><br/>1. Ontkenning is geen rivier in Egypte<br/><br/>2. Je gemartelde psyche helpt je muziek niet, dus krijg hulp<br/><br/>3. Probeer denkbeeldige vrienden<br/><br/>Haal uit!<br/><br/>We zijn allemaal zwaar getraumatiseerd op het hoofdkwartier van de Fashion Police. Abbas is iemand die we niet graag arresteerden. Hij zit momenteel in hechtenis en probeert wraak te nemen door kleding aan te trekken uit andere fantasieshows. Hij glitterde zichzelf gewoon om er uit te zien als Edward Cullen uit Twilight. Als een openbare dienst boodschap en om verdere zenuwinzinkingen te voorkomen, gaven we hem de volgende voorbeelden van mannen uit de rode loper van hetzelfde evenement.<br/><br/>Zohaib Hassan<br/><br/>Bij twijfel, speel het veilig. De zanger ziet eruit als je gemiddelde oom bij een shaadi. Een eenvoudig zwart pak zonder accessoires, zelfs als het een beetje onevenredig is, is werkbaar. Zohaib's look is vermengd met alles en niets, en als je geen gevoel voor mode hebt of het geld hebt om een stylist in te huren, is dit oké. Het draagt niet het risico van hartstilstand voor mede-deelnemers op een evenement. Gezien Abbas' delicate mentale conditie, is deze look waar hij naar zou moeten streven, voor altijd en voor altijd.<br/><br/>Ali Zafar<br/><br/>Op een dag, na decennia van therapie, zou Abbas kunnen streven naar kleding zoals die van Ali Zafar. De dappere zomerlook is bijna perfect. Ali kwam heel dicht bij het kijken als een maître d in een Frans restaurant met zijn witte zomerjas met zwarte revers, maar het shirt redt het, laat staan het satijn. Zijn broek zou belachelijk zijn geweest als ze niet op de enkels waren gevouwen. De schoenen zijn waar hipster chic happy endings van gemaakt zijn. |
| Determining soil hydraulic properties with different wetting liquids : A thesis submitted in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science at Lincoln University<br/><br/>Abstract<br/><br/>Soil hydraulic properties such as hydraulic conductivity, water retention and plant water relationships dominate the water movement processes. For example, the infiltration, evaporation and water flow within the soil. As a widespread phenomenon in soil, soil water repellency alters the soil hydraulic functions by resisting the water flow into the soils. Moreover, the hydraulic properties not only depend on the pore system of soil but also are affected by the physicochemical properties of the pore surfaces. Compared to water, ethanol is not affected by the water repellency due to its lower surface tension. The purpose of using ethanol is to eliminate the effect of soil water repellency on hydraulic properties measurements. However, applying pure ethanol into natural soil can degrade the soil organic materials and lead to changes in physical properties. Therefore, the aqueous ethanol solutions can be an alternative option. Nevertheless, the feasibility of using aqueous ethanol for determining soil liquid retention curve remains unknown. This study aims to test the feasibility of the aqueous ethanol solutions (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % and 100 % v/v) for establishing liquid retention curve under a small range of applied pressure in coarse sand samples with different wettability and organic amended natural soil (Templeton silt loam (TSL) with mushroom compost, biochar, dairy effluent, and municipal compost, the application rate was 15 % by weight). The result showed that the desorption of testing aqueous ethanol solutions compared to water was quicker by approximately 1 to 3x based on the liquid content at the same applied pressure and the time for reaching each equilibrium. The outcomes from the sand experiment suggested that when the concentration of aqueous ethanol solution was below 50 %, the losses via evaporation were less than 1% and the relative differences between testing liquid and water was lower than 10 %. However, the evaporation losses were 11.06 % and 24.6 %, and the relative differences were all around 15 % and 30 % in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution, respectively. In contrast, the organic amendments in Templeton silt loam not only increased the water retention capability but also reduced the evaporation losses. The evaporation losses in TSL soil and TSL with organic amendments soil were with 1 % in solutions with less than 50 % ethanol content. Evaporation losses of 50 % and 100 % ethanol were 2.8 % and 2.9 %, respectively. The relative differences between water and testing liquid were similar to the sand experiment when the testing liquid concentrations were below 50 %. However, the relative differences in 50 % and 100 % ethanol solution were smaller than in the sand sample with around 10 % and 15%, respectively. Additionally, the analysis of relative difference suggested that almost all aqueous ethanol solutions had lower volumetric liquid content at the same supplied pressure compared to water, which was a reflection of the aqueous ethanol solutions desorbed faster than water under equivalent pressure. Therefore, 10 % to 40 % of ethanol solutions could be considered an alternative for determining soil hydraulic properties due to their faster desorption rate and not being affected by soil water repellency. Due to the evaporation and dissolution of organic material, aqueous ethanol solutions above 50% concentration were not suitable for coarse sand or medium-textured soil.... [Show full abstract] | Bepaling van de hydraulische eigenschappen van de bodem met verschillende bevochtigingsvloeistoffen : een proefschrift ingediend in gedeeltelijke naleving van de vereisten voor de Degree of Master of Science aan de Lincoln University<br/><br/>abstracte<br/><br/>Bodemhydraulische eigenschappen zoals hydraulische geleidbaarheid, waterretentie en plantwaterrelaties domineren de waterbewegingsprocessen. Bijvoorbeeld de infiltratie, verdamping en waterstroom in de bodem. Als een wijdverbreid fenomeen in de bodem verandert bodemwaterafstoting de hydraulische functies van de bodem door de waterstroom in de bodem te weerstaan. Bovendien zijn de hydraulische eigenschappen niet alleen afhankelijk van het poriesysteem van de bodem, maar worden ook beïnvloed door de fysisch-chemische eigenschappen van de porieoppervlakken. Vergeleken met water wordt ethanol niet beïnvloed door de waterafstotigheid vanwege zijn lagere oppervlaktespanning. Het doel van het gebruik van ethanol is om het effect van bodemwaterafstoting op hydraulische eigenschappenmetingen te elimineren. Het toepassen van puur ethanol in natuurlijke bodem kan echter de bodem organische materialen degraderen en leiden tot veranderingen in fysische eigenschappen. Daarom kunnen de waterige ethanoloplossingen een alternatieve optie zijn. Niettemin blijft de haalbaarheid van het gebruik van waterige ethanol voor het bepalen van de bodemvloeistofretentiecurve onbekend. Deze studie is bedoeld om de haalbaarheid van de waterige ethanoloplossingen (0, 10 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 %, 50 % en 100 % v/v) te testen voor het vaststellen van de vloeibare retentiecurve onder een klein drukbereik in grof zandmonsters met verschillende bevochtigbaarheid en organisch gemodificeerde natuurlijke bodem (Templeton slib leem (TSL) met paddenstoelcompost, biogas, kool en melkzuur. Het resultaat toonde aan dat de desorptie van het testen van waterige ethanoloplossingen in vergelijking met water met ongeveer 1 tot 3x sneller was op basis van het vloeibare gehalte bij dezelfde toegepaste druk en de tijd om elk evenwicht te bereiken. De resultaten van het zandexperiment suggereerden dat wanneer de concentratie van waterige ethanoloplossing lager was dan 50%, de verliezen via verdamping minder dan 1% waren en de relatieve verschillen tussen het testen van vloeistof en water minder dan 10% waren. De verdampingsverliezen waren echter 11,06 % en 24,6 %, en de relatieve verschillen waren allemaal rond 15 % en 30 % in respectievelijk 50 % en 100 % ethanoloplossing. Daarentegen hebben de organische wijzigingen in Templeton slib leem niet alleen het waterretentievermogen verhoogd, maar ook de verdampingsverliezen verminderd. De verdampingsverliezen in TSL-bodem en TSL-bodem met organische modificaties waren met 1 % in oplossingen met minder dan 50 % ethanolgehalte. De verdampingsverliezen van 50 % en 100 % ethanol waren respectievelijk 2,8 % en 2,9 %. De relatieve verschillen tussen water en testvloeistof waren vergelijkbaar met het zandexperiment wanneer de testvloeistofconcentraties lager waren dan 50 %. De relatieve verschillen in 50 % en 100 % ethanoloplossing waren echter kleiner dan in het zandmonster met respectievelijk ongeveer 10 % en 15 %. Bovendien suggereerde de analyse van het relatieve verschil dat bijna alle waterige ethanoloplossingen een lager volumetrisch vloeibaar gehalte hadden bij dezelfde geleverde druk in vergelijking met water, wat een weerspiegeling was van de waterige ethanoloplossingen die sneller gedesorbeerd werden dan water onder equivalente druk. Daarom kan 10 tot 40 % van de ethanoloplossingen worden beschouwd als een alternatief voor het bepalen van de hydraulische eigenschappen van de bodem vanwege hun snellere desorptiesnelheid en omdat ze niet worden beïnvloed door bodemwaterafstoting. Door de verdamping en het oplossen van organisch materiaal waren waterige ethanoloplossingen boven de 50%-concentratie niet geschikt voor grof zand of middelmatig getextureerde grond....
