Undocumented migrants have nothing. They are not allowed to work. They have no right to state benefits nor to a place to live. They are unseen and potentially the most vulnerable group in the UK today.<br/><br/>Undocumented (or irregular) migrants include those trafficked into the sex trade or for domestic servitude; they include visa overstayers; those whose asylum applications have been refused and others who have been subject to failures in the immigration system. All of these may originally have come to the UK legally.<br/><br/>'Illegal immigrants' – those imagined to have entered the country in the backs of lorries – make up a small proportion of the undocumented.<br/><br/>Indeed some sources suggest that half the estimated 120,000 undocumented children in the UK were actually born here to undocumented parents. These children are disadvantaged from birth, solely by their immigration status.<br/><br/>The blog tells the stories of the undocumented. It highlights their daily struggles and vulnerabilities, but also their strength and resilience. It's not an easy read.<br/><br/>You can access the blog via our website (bottom of right hand column on Home Page).<br/><br/>The blog has won the online category of the Speaking Together media awards. The awards were a new addition this year to the Migrant and Refugee Woman of the Year Awards celebration at the Royal Festival Hall in London as part of International Women's Day. The panel of judges – including novelist and playwright Gillian Slovo, and journalist and author, Hannah Pool – was particularly looking for work that challenged myths and stereotypes.<br/><br/>The blog has also won the Blog North Awards 2013 in the Best Writing category and was also shortlisted for an Amnesty International Media Award. | Navigatie<br/><br/>'Life Without Papers' wint beste schrijfprijs<br/><br/>Het blogproject, "Life Without Papers", gecreëerd door Len Grant, bevat verhalen over migrantenfamilies en jongeren zonder papieren. migranten zonder papieren hebben niets.

| Sabbath School Lesson<br/><br/>In Galatians, Paul tackles issues such as freedom, the role of the law in salvation, our condition in Christ, and the nature of the Spirit-led life, as well as the age-old question, How can sinful humans be made right before a holy and just God?<br/><br/>Many scholars believe that Galatians may be the earliest of Paul's letters. It was written in A.D. 49, shortly after the famous Jerusalem Council (Acts 15). Therefore, the book may be the oldest Christian document known. As Acts and Galatians make clear, the early church found itself in a fierce battle over the nature of salvation, especially in the case of Gentiles. According to a group of Jewish believers, known as Judaizers, belief in Jesus alone was not good enough for Gentiles. Gentiles must also be circumcised and follow the laws of Moses (Acts 15:1).<br/><br/>This quarter's Bible study guide invites us to journey with the apostle Paul as he pleads with the Galatians to remain true to Jesus. It also gives us a chance to reflect on our own understanding of the truths that opened the way for Martin Luther's ultimate break with Rome and the restoration of the biblical gospel. | Sabbat School Les<br/><br/>In Galaten behandelt Paulus kwesties als vrijheid, de rol van de wet in de verlossing, onze toestand in Christus en de aard van het door de Geest geleide leven, evenals de eeuwenoude vraag: Hoe kunnen zondige mensen rechtgemaakt worden voor een heilige en rechtvaardige God?<br/><br/>Veel geleerden geloven dat Galaten de vroegste van Paulus' brieven kunnen zijn. Het werd geschreven in 49 na Christus, kort na de beroemde Raad van Jeruzalem (Handelingen 15). Daarom kan het boek het oudste bekende christelijke document zijn. Zoals Handelingen en Galaten duidelijk maken, bevond de vroege kerk zich in een felle strijd over de aard van de verlossing, vooral in het geval van de heidenen. Volgens een groep Joodse gelovigen, bekend als Judaizers, was het geloof in Jezus alleen niet goed genoeg voor heidenen. Heidenen moeten ook worden besneden en de wetten van Mozes volgen (Handelingen 15:1).<br/><br/>De bijbelstudiegids van dit kwartaal nodigt ons uit om met de apostel Paulus te reizen terwijl hij de Galaten smeekt om trouw te blijven aan Jezus. Het geeft ons ook de kans om na te denken over ons eigen begrip van de waarheden die de weg vrijmaakten voor Martin Luthers ultieme breuk met Rome en het herstel van het Bijbelse evangelie. |

Ze was het oudste kind en dochter van Karel II, Groothertog van Mecklenburg, Charlotte en haar zussen, koningin Louise van Pruisen, koningin Frederica van Hannover en prinses Theresia van Thurn und Taxis, werden beschouwd als de mooiste vrouwen van hun tijd. Jean Paul Friedrich Richter wijdde zijn roman Titan aan de vier mooie, Charlotte groeide op in Hannover, waar haar vader als gouverneur diende, namens zijn zwager, koning George III van het Verenigd Koninkrijk, die in Londen woonde. Toen Charlotte twaalf jaar oud was, stierf haar moeder en werd ze opgevoed door haar moederszus Charlotte, die in 1784 met haar vader trouwde en haar zussen werden gebracht door haar grootmoeder Maria Louise Albertine van Leiningen-Falkenburg-Dagsburg in Darmstadt. Op 3 september 1785, op vijftienjarige leeftijd, trouwde Charlotte met hertog Frederik, hertog van Saksen-Altenburg, het huwelijk was niet gelukkig, Charlotte was mentaal superieur aan Frederick, die haar begon te negeren. Ze hadden ook problemen, Saksen-Hildburghausen was financieel geruïneerd door het rampzalige beleid van Fredericks voorgangers. De ontvangers stonden de hertog en hertogin slechts een verminderde burgerlijke lijst toe, Charlottes vader en twee broers bleven vaak bij Charlotte in Hildburghausen. In 1787 verhuisde ze permanent naar Hildburghausen en werd voorzitter van de kredietcommissie. In 1792 vluchtten Charlottes grootmoeder en haar zussen voordat het Franse leger van Darmstadt naar Hildburghausen oprukte en haar grootmoeder merkte dat Charlottes echtgenoot was. Van al zijn plichten vervult hij zijn huwelijksplichten met ijver. Charlotte, die nooit van deze man hield, is altijd zwanger, de familie bracht enkele zorgeloze weken door in Hildburghausen. In 1793, Charlotte's grootmoeder keerde terug uit ballingschap en reisde met Charlotte's zussen naar Frankfurt am Main, Charlotte had een zeer intieme en liefdevolle relatie met haar zus Friederike en familieleden in Strelitz. In 1803 en 1805 bezocht het Pruisische koninklijke paar Hildburghausen, voor deze gelegenheid stonden de ontvangers het hertogelijke paar toe om een deel van hun meubels te vernieuwen. Louise had geholpen bij het opstellen van de oorlogsverklaring, Christian Truchseß von Wetzhausen zu Bettenburg was een vriend van het hertogelijke echtpaar en peetvader van Charlottes zoon Edward. Veel toeschouwers waren gekomen om de Beierse kroonprinses te zien, toen Truchseß zijn gasten ontving, probeerde hij de lagere Charlotte eerst naar zijn kasteel te leiden, maar ze weigerde, verwijzend naar haar dochter. Truchseß antwoordde: Uwe Hoogheid zal mij vergeven, maar zolang dit kasteel hier heeft gestaan, greep Therese toen de andere arm van de baronnen, en de drie liepen samen door de poort. De hertogin gaf ongeveer de helft van haar inkomen aan de armen, gepensioneerden.<br/><br/>1617.<br/>Karel van Hessen-Kassel<br/>•<br/>Prins Karel van Hessen-Kassel was een cadet lid van het huis van Hessen-Kassel en een Deense generaal-veldmaarschalk. Opgegroeid met familieleden aan het Deense hof, bracht hij het grootste deel van zijn leven door in Denemarken en zijn moeder was een dochter van koning George II van Groot-Brittannië en Caroline van Ansbach en een zus van koningin Louise van Denemarken. Zijn vader, de toekomstige landgraaf, verliet de familie in 1747, in 1755 beëindigde hij formeel het huwelijk met Maria. De grootvader, Willem VIII, landgraaf van Hessen, verleende het graafschap Hanau en zijn inkomsten aan Maria, de jonge prins Karel en zijn twee broers, Willem en Frederik, werden opgevoed door hun moeder en gevoed door protestantse familieleden sinds 1747. In 1756 verhuisde Maria naar Denemarken om voor de minderjarige kinderen van haar zus, koningin Louise van Denemarken, te zorgen. Met haar nam ze haar zonen mee die aan het hof in het Christiansborg Paleis in Kopenhagen werden opgevoed. De Hessische prinsen bleven later in Denemarken en werden de belangrijkste heren, alleen de oudste broer Willem keerde in 1785 terug naar Hessen, toen hij de landgraven beklom. Karel begon een carrière in Denemarken. In 1758 werd hij benoemd tot kolonel, op de leeftijd van 20 generaal-majoor, ook in 1766 werd hij benoemd tot gouverneur-generaal van Noorwegen, een positie die hij behield tot 1768, maar die meestal titulair bleef, omdat hij nooit naar Noorwegen ging in deze periode. In 1763 trouwde zijn oudere broer William met hun eerste neef, Charles volgde op 30 augustus 1766 in Christiansborg Palace - zijn vrouw was Louise van Denemarken, en Charles werd dus zwager van zijn neef, koning Christian VII. Het huwelijk vond plaats ondanks het advies dat er tegen werd gegeven, vanwege beschuldigingen van ontucht door prins Charles. Kort daarna raakte Karel in ongenade bij de rechtbank, en begin 1767 kregen hij en zij hun eerste kind, Marie Sophie, daar in 1767 en vervolgens hun tweede kind, William, in 1769. In 1768 kocht Karel het landgoed en dorp Offenbach-Rumpenheim van de familie Edelsheim. In 1771 liet hij het herenhuis uitbreiden tot een kasteel en prinselijke zetel en zijn moeder Maria woonde in het paleis tot haar dood in 1772. In 1781 verkocht Karel het Rumpenheimpaleis aan zijn jongere broer, Karel nam met zijn familie zijn woonplaats in het kasteel Gottorp in Sleeswijk. Ze zouden hun derde kind Frederik daar in 1771 hebben, in 1770 gaf koning Christian VII aan zijn zus het landgoed van Tegelhof in Güby tussen de stad Sleeswijk en Eckernförde. Van 1772 tot 1776 liet Karel een zomerresidentie bouwen op de plaats die hij Louisenlund noemde ter ere van zijn vrouw, in september 1772 werd Karel benoemd tot opperbevelhebber van het Noorse leger en hij en Louise verhuisden naar Christiana. De overdracht was een gevolg van de staatsgreep van koning Gustav III van Zweden op 19 augustus 1772, terwijl in Noorwegen, prinses Louise bevallen van hun vierde kind Juliane in 1773.<br/><br/>18.<br/>Louise Caroline van Hessen-Kassel<br/>•<br/>Louise Caroline werd geboren te Gottorp in het hertogdom Sleeswijk aan landgrave Karel van Hessen-Kassel en zijn vrouw Prinses Louise van Denemarken.<br/>•<br/>Louise Caroline<br/><br/>19.<br/>Frederik van Hessen<br/>•<br/>Landgraaf Frederik<br/><br/>20.<br/>Prins Willem van Hessen<br/>•<br/>Willem van Hessen-Kassel<br/><br/>212223.<br/>Prinses Louise24.<br/>Sophia Frederica van Mecklenburg-Schwerin<br/>•<br/>Sophia Frederica van Me252627 maternal28.<br/>Albrecht Azzo II van Milaan<br/>•<br/>Alberto Azzo II, Markgraaf van Milaan, en Ligurië, graaf van Gavello en Padua, Rovigo, Lunigiana, Monselice, en Montagnana, ook bekend als Albertezzo II, was een machtige edelman in het Heilige Roomse Rijk.

Hij erfde zijn vaders kantoren rond 1020, en voortdurend vergroot zijn bezittingen in Noord-Italië, in 1069-1070, probeerde hij Maine te verwerven voor zijn zoon Hugh, omdat zijn vrouw, Garsende, was een mede-erfgename van de vorige graven van Maine. Hugh werd uitgeroepen tot graaf, maar hij kon niet zegevieren tegen Robert, de hertog van Normandië, in de Investituur Controverse tussen Henry IV, Heilige Romeinse keizer, en paus Gregorius VII, Azzo probeerde te bemiddelen, maar later voegde hij zich bij de kant van de paus. Rond 1073 maakte hij een kasteel te Este zijn residentie, waaruit het Huis van Este, voor zijn bouwproject, Este weinig meer dan een dorp was. Zijn zoon Welf verhuisde eerst naar Karinthië en vervolgens naar Beieren, wat resulteerde in een van de belangrijkste families in de Europese geschiedenis, een andere zoon, Fulk I van Milaan, maakte het eerste gedocumenteerde gebruik van de titel Marquis dEste. Azzo II trouwde met Kunigunde, de dochter van Welf II, graaf van Altdorf en ze hadden een bekend kind, Welf Hertog van Beieren van 1070 tot 1077 en van 1096 tot zijn dood die het eerste lid van de Welf tak van het Huis van Este was. Zijn tweede huwelijk was met Garsende, dochter van Herbert I, graaf van Maine en zij hadden de volgende bekende zonen, Fulco I, markies van Milaan, voorouder van de Italiaanse tak van het Huis van Este Hugh V, graaf van Maine, had geen probleem.

Welf was de zoon van Azzo II van Este en zijn vrouw Kunigunde van Altdorf, toen Welfs moederlijke oom, Welf, hertog van Karinthië, kinderloos stierf, Welf erfde zijn eigendom. Welf trouwde met Ethelinde van Northeim, dochter van Otto II, hertog van Beieren, toen zijn schoonvader, hertog Otto, een vijand van koning Hendrik IV was geworden en zijn hertogdom had verloren, Welf bleef trouw aan de koning. In overeenstemming met de bevelen van Hendrik, verwierp hij en scheidde zijn hertogin, Ethelinde en deze gebeurtenis vond plaats in Goslar in 1070, toen de staten van Beieren zich rustig aan de nieuw gemaakte hertog, die was de vertegenwoordiger van een van de oudste families in de provincie. Zijn afwijzing van de hertogin, die had kunnen worden beschouwd als een daad van onrecht. Paus en keizer werden oppervlakkig verzoend in 1076, maar het jaar zag hen opnieuw bezig met actieve vijandelijkheden. Henry, als gevolg van herhaalde daden van opstand, verklaarde Welf afgezet in zijn nieuw verworven hertogdom. Echter, ondersteund door zijn trouwe Beieren, en geholpen door zijn vader in Italië, Welf was in staat om zijn plaats te behouden, maar Gregorius stierf in 1085 en zijn opvolgers nam een minder intensieve rol in de aangelegenheden van Duitsland. Welf trouwde in 1070 met Judith van Vlaanderen, dochter van Baldwin IV, graaf van Vlaanderen, en de weduwe van Tostig Godwinson, graaf van Northumbria. In 1089 trouwde Welfs zoon Welf met Matilda van Toscane, waardoor de relaties met de paus werden versterkt, maar nadat de jongere Welf in 1095 van Matilda gescheiden was, herstelde Welf zich met koning Hendrik IV en werd opnieuw bevestigd in zijn positie als hertog van Beieren.

Zijn belangrijkste succes was het voorkomen van een botsing tussen medekruisvaarders, die Byzantijnse grondgebied op weg naar Constantinopel had geplunderd, Welf zelf ontsnapte aan het fiasco, maar stierf op zijn weg terug in Paphos, Cyprus, in 1101 en werd begraven in Weingarten Abbey.

This way he gets to have all the goodies that weren't given out!<br/><br/>6<br/>comments:<br/><br/>It was Halloween here last night and we had ...... no kids at all at our door.<br/><br/>Halloween is not really celebrated here. The shopkeepers try to promote it by advertising and selling various Halloween gear but it just doesn't catch on at all.

| Follow Us<br/><br/>ARE YOU AN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Craving Sugar? Here's What Your Body Is Trying to Tell You<br/><br/>by<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>PHOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Weight gain from out-of-control cravings aside, it can be frustrating to have a constant hankering for something unhealthy and not know why. The good news is that there's usually a reason underlying that burning desire to house a bag of potato chips, or the feeling that you might actually die if you don't get a pickle rightthisinstant (even though you're not pregnant). If you're having visions of Milky Way bars, for example, it could mean that you're missing a very specific nutrient in your diet. (Yup—it's more complicated than said chocolate bar being so darn delicious.)<br/><br/>We talked to Los Angeles–based dietitian Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., to get the skinny on some common food cravings, as well as what you can do to satiate the hunger without going overboard. Keep scrolling for some seriously good information!<br/><br/>If you're craving chocolate<br/><br/>It means: You could be lacking magnesium in your diet, says Lenchewski. "Magnesium is an essential mineral involved in energy production, glucose metabolism, and muscle function. This is especially true for those hitting the gym hard," she explains. Additionally, magnesium levels lower during the pre-menstrual weeks of your period, which explains why PMS so often comes with chocolate cravings.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for high-quality, low-sugar dark chocolate, which is naturally high in magnesium. "I recommend sticking to 75 per cent cocoa or higher, and pairing it with another magnesium-rich source like sunflower seeds," says Lenchewski. She suggests the chocolate brand Hu, a small-batch food company that focuses on high-quality ingredients produced locally. "It's a little pricey, but all the more reason to keep portions in check," she says. "It's my personal favourite." We're also big fans of superfood-packed Zenbunni.<br/><br/>If you're craving candy<br/><br/>It means: "Craving pure sugar is a good indication that you're running low on energy," says Lenchewski. "Think about it. What is the one thing you're itching for after a terrible night's sleep or at around 4 p.m. during a stressful workday? The answer is usually sugar because it's used as instant fuel for our body's cells."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for apples with nut butter. "If you're raiding your co-workers' candy stash, I recommend a more slow-burn carbohydrate with a source of fat or protein," says Lenchewski. "Unlike simple sugar, this will fuel your cells while avoiding the post-sugar crash. Two options that make for great pick-me-ups the next time you're craving candy: a sliced apple with your choice of nut butter, or berries with 2% unsweetened Greek yoghurt." We like quashing a sweet tooth with these addictive coconut chips, too—they're filling, free of any added sugar, and just so good.<br/><br/>If you're craving salt<br/><br/>It means: "If nothing but the saltiest pickle will do, you may not be drinking enough H2O," says Lenchewski. "Salt helps the body hold on to water, so we crave it when we're in need of fluids."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for water. "Stay hydrated, especially as we approach the summer months," she says. The next time a craving hits, try quenching it (literally) with a few refreshing glasses and you might find the urgency to sodium binge disappears. "If plain water bores you, try adding in mint, lemon, or frozen fruit to mix it up," says Lenchewski. And if that still doesn't do the trick, there's a healthier alternative to bagged chips or fries. "If you're really just craving salt after all, toasted seaweed is a great low-calorie option," she says.<br/><br/>If you're craving starchy carbs like pasta<br/><br/>It means: "Because high-carb foods boost the feel-good hormone serotonin, starch cravings can be a sign you're in need of a mood booster," says Lenchewski.<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a bath! "Bust out the Epsom salts, because it's time for some serious R+R," says Lenchewski. "Trust me. Indulging in a starch free-for-all feels really good in the moment, but it will likely bum you out more the next day." (As anyone who has ever over-indulged a pizza or pasta craving knows.) So the next time you want to dive head first into a bowl of carbs, draw a bath, light a candle, and treat yourself without any regret or dense calories.<br/><br/>If you're craving ice cream<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>It means: "Your body may be telling you it's in need of some healthy fat."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for coconut ice cream. "I'm a realist, so if you're craving ice cream, I'm not going to recommend a handful of walnuts, which are, of course, full of healthy fat," says Lenchewski. "For ice cream emergencies, I recommend lower-in-sugar coconut ice-creams like Coconut Bliss or Kippy's three-ingredient ice cream in Los Angeles." We can vouch for the fact that coconut ice cream tastes incredible and just like the real thing.<br/><br/>If you're craving a burger<br/><br/>It means: You need iron. "If you can't stop thinking about red meat, there's a chance your body is craving iron, b12 and folic acid," says Lenchewski. "This is especially true during or around that time of the month."<br/><br/>Instead, reach for a healthier burger. "I'm a proponent of grass fed, antibiotic and hormone-free red meat once a week," says Lenchewski. "Try experimenting with an open-faced bison burger—which, cut for cut, is leaner and has more iron than beef." Don't eat meat? Try to incorporate some kind of plant-based iron supplement into your routine, like spirulina. | Volg ons<br/><br/>BENT U EEN<br/><br/>INSIDER<br/><br/>Suiker verlangen? Dit is wat je lichaam je probeert te vertellen<br/><br/>door<br/>Byrdie<br/><br/>FOTO:<br/><br/>Jacquemus<br/><br/>Gewichtstoename van out-of-control verlangens terzijde, kan het frustrerend zijn om een constante achtervolging voor iets ongezond en niet weten waarom. Het goede nieuws is dat er meestal een reden is achter die brandende wens om een zak aardappelchips te huisvesten, of het gevoel dat je eigenlijk zou kunnen sterven als je geen augurken krijgt op dit moment (ook al ben je niet zwanger). Als je bijvoorbeeld visioenen hebt van melkwegrepen, kan dit betekenen dat je een zeer specifieke voedingsstof mist in je dieet. (Yup - het is ingewikkelder dan dat chocoladereep zo verdomd lekker is.)<br/><br/>We spraken met de in Los Angeles gevestigde diëtist Shira Lenchewski, M.S., R.D., om de magere te krijgen op een aantal gemeenschappelijke voedsel hunkeren, evenals wat u kunt doen om de honger te verzadigen zonder overboord te gaan. Blijf scrollen voor een aantal serieus goede informatie!<br/><br/>Als je zin hebt in chocolade<br/><br/>Het betekent: je zou een tekort aan magnesium in je dieet kunnen hebben, zegt Lenchewski. "Magnesium is een essentieel mineraal dat betrokken is bij de energieproductie, het glucosemetabolisme en de spierfunctie. Dit geldt vooral voor degenen die de sportschool hard raken," legt ze uit. Bovendien, magnesium niveaus lager tijdens de pre-menstruele weken van uw menstruatie, dat verklaart waarom PMS zo vaak komt met chocolade hunkeren.<br/><br/>Reik in plaats daarvan naar hoogwaardige, suikerarme donkere chocolade, die van nature rijk is aan magnesium. "Ik raad aan om aan 75 procent cacao of hoger te blijven, en deze te koppelen aan een andere magnesiumrijke bron zoals zonnebloempitten," zegt Lenchewski. Ze suggereert het chocolademerk Hu, een kleinschalig voedselbedrijf dat zich richt op ingrediënten van hoge kwaliteit die lokaal worden geproduceerd. "Het is een beetje prijzig, maar des te meer reden om porties in toom te houden," zegt ze. "Het is mijn persoonlijke favoriet." We zijn ook grote fans van superfood verpakte Zenbunni.<br/><br/>Als je naar snoep verlangt<br/><br/>Het betekent: "Het koesteren van pure suiker is een goede indicatie dat je weinig energie hebt," zegt Lenchewski. "Denk erover na. Wat is het enige waar je jeukt na een vreselijke nachtrust of rond 16.00 uur tijdens een stressvolle werkdag? Het antwoord is meestal suiker, omdat het wordt gebruikt als directe brandstof voor de cellen van ons lichaam.<br/><br/>"Als je de snoepvoorraad van je collega's overvalt, raad ik een meer langzaam verbrande koolhydraten aan met een bron van vet of eiwitten," zegt Lenchewski. "In tegenstelling tot eenvoudige suiker, zal dit je cellen voeden terwijl het vermijden van de post-suiker crash. Twee opties die zorgen voor geweldige pick-me-ups de volgende keer dat je naar snoep verlangt: een gesneden appel met je keuze van notenboter, of bessen met 2% ongezoete Griekse yoghurt. We houden er ook van om een zoete tand te breken met deze verslavende kokoschips - ze vullen, vrij van toegevoegde suiker, en gewoon zo goed.<br/><br/>Als je naar zout verlangt<br/><br/>Het betekent: "Als niets anders dan de zoutste augurken zal doen, kan het zijn dat je niet genoeg H2O drinkt", zegt Lenchewski. "Zout helpt het lichaam vast te houden aan water, dus we hunkeren ernaar als we vocht nodig hebben."<br/><br/>"Blijf gehydrateerd, vooral als we de zomermaanden naderen," zegt ze. De volgende keer dat een hunkering treft, probeer het (letterlijk) te blussen met een paar verfrissende glazen en je zou kunnen vinden dat de urgentie om natrium binge verdwijnt. "Als gewoon water je verveelt, probeer dan munt, citroen of bevroren fruit toe te voegen om het te mengen," zegt Lenchewski. En als dat nog steeds niet de truc doet, is er een gezonder alternatief voor ingepakte chips of frietjes. "Als je echt gewoon zout wilt, is geroosterd zeewier een geweldige caloriearme optie," zegt ze.<br/><br/>Als je honger hebt naar zetmeelrijke koolhydraten zoals pasta<br/><br/>Het betekent: "Omdat koolhydraatrijke voedingsmiddelen het feel-good hormoon serotonine stimuleren, kan zetmeel hunkeren een teken zijn dat je een stemmingsbooster nodig hebt," zegt Lenchewski.<br/><br/>In plaats daarvan, reik voor een bad! "Bust uit de Epsom zouten, want het is tijd voor een aantal serieuze R + R," zegt Lenchewski. "Vertrouw me. Het verwennen van een zetmeel vrij-voor-alles voelt echt goed op het moment, maar het zal waarschijnlijk je uit meer de volgende dag." (Zoals iedereen die ooit een pizza of pasta hunkeren heeft overweldigd weet.) Dus de volgende keer dat je je hoofd eerst in een kom koolhydraten wilt dompelen, een bad wilt trekken, een kaars moet aansteken en jezelf wilt verwennen zonder spijt of dichte calorieën.<br/><br/>Als je hunkert naar ijs<br/><br/>5 / 6<br/><br/>Het betekent: "Je lichaam kan je vertellen dat het wat gezond vet nodig heeft."<br/><br/>"Ik ben een realist, dus als je naar ijs verlangt, ga ik niet een handvol walnoten aanbevelen, die natuurlijk vol zitten met gezond vet," zegt Lenchewski. "Voor ijs noodgevallen, adviseer ik lagere-in-suiker kokos-ijs-als Coconut Bliss of Kippy's drie-ingrediënt ijs in Los Angeles." We kunnen garanderen voor het feit dat kokos-ijs smaakt ongelooflijk en net als het echte ding.<br/><br/>Als je een hamburger wilt<br/><br/>Het betekent: je hebt ijzer nodig. "Als je niet kunt stoppen met denken aan rood vlees, is er een kans dat je lichaam naar ijzer, b12 en foliumzuur verlangt," zegt Lenchewski. "Dit geldt vooral tijdens of rond die tijd van de maand."<br/><br/>"Ik ben eens per week een voorstander van grasgevoed, antibiotica en hormoonvrij rood vlees," zegt Lenchewski. "Probeer te experimenteren met een open bizonburger - die, gesneden voor gesneden, slanker is en meer ijzer bevat dan rundvlees." Probeer een soort plantaardig ijzersupplement in je routine op te nemen, zoals spirulina. |

| Web Services, Vendors And Cyber Laws!<br/><br/>Updated On:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerization of this world changed human performance scenario to a great extent and that too beyond measurement. For instance, Now you can send vital information all across the globe with a single mouse click, thanks to internet connectivity. Sadly, it is this wide connectivity and popularity among people, internet has also increased chances for computer crimes. Internet crimes or computer crimes are widely known as 'Cyber Crimes'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is something new in the judiciary system but has gained a lot of attention lately. The term cyber crime is something very synonymous with conventional crime, the only difference being medium of execution. There are majorly two types of cyber crimes, the first one is in which computers are the main targets and these include cases of data damage, malicious code and even criminal data access. The second one is in which computer is only a tool using which conventional crimes are committed for eg cyber terrorism, spamming, cyber stalking and many more.<br/><br/>This is where a website consultant or a vendor comes into scene. Although not aware of all the cyber laws present till date, a website vendor can advise you on some of the most vital cyber laws while creating your site.<br/><br/>This may include common knowledge of copy rights or even protecting the content of your own website. Explaining you all the rights you posses as a website owner is also one the tasks a website vendor may do while developing your website. A vendor can also assist you by offering you information on different cyber laws to protect data. Besides all of this, a vendor can also offer you information on any new cyber law that you may not be aware of till know. Cyber laws may vary from nation to nation, one recent example can be of the cookie law released in the United Kingdom, which prevents the website from saving any user browsing data. As per the Cookie Law, websites in the United Kingdom cannot save cookie files without informational consent from the surfer.<br/><br/>It is after the implementation of such law, websites now have a pop-up window, which seeks the consent of the visitor for saving cookies files. Such files are used by websites to analyze the browsing pattern of visitors based on which advertisements are then posted on a user window. With hacking not anymore a new thing for all of us, do you think such rules and regulations can prevent online forgery or cyber crime? Technology has developed at a rapid rate but still people do not prefer shopping online due to fear of personal or bank account details getting hacked. With the rise of cyber crime, need of stringent cyber laws have also increased to curb the same and to promote a risk free shopping experience.<br/><br/>Classes of Cyber Crimes<br/><br/>Over the years there have been three major classes of cyber crimes:<br/><br/>Unauthorized access of computer system cases, which involves hacking or stealing usernames and passwords to gain access over personal information of the respective user. These kind of backdoor access are organized with the help of Trojan Horse. Releasing malicious programs like Trojan House, worms or computer viruses etc. The last class includes cyber stalking a user or online harassment .<br/><br/>Direct implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Decrease in sales<br/><br/>Decrease in staff output due to network delays<br/><br/>Loss of personalized information like research work<br/><br/>Disruption in communication process<br/><br/>Indirect implications of Cyber crimes<br/><br/>Credibility issue in our financial system<br/><br/>Brand image is tarnished in the market<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect business to business relationship in the market<br/><br/>Sense of trust in state policies and government agencies is lost<br/><br/>Preventing Cyber Crime<br/><br/>As netizens there are certain precautions that we should consider for a safe and secure online experience. Here are some of them:<br/><br/>First thing to do will be to keep personal information to your self and avoid sharing the same online.<br/><br/>Avoid sharing any photographs with online chat friends or strangers.<br/><br/>Installing latest version of anti-virus on your system can offer you a good line of defense against internet threats like viruses and malware.<br/><br/>Keeping back up of your valuable data is a good option to avoid problems like virus contamination.<br/><br/>Avoid sending credit card information to sites that are unsecured and don't have any valid certificate.<br/><br/>Installing safety programme that offers you control over site cookies and saves you from being tracked by websites.<br/><br/>Putting host-based intrusions detection devices on servers will help you keep track of irregularities on your website traffic.<br/><br/>Use of firewall is advised.<br/><br/>Why Cyber attacks are so popular?<br/><br/>Cheaper than traditional cheating methods<br/><br/>Tracking cyber crimes are not easy<br/><br/>Exact locations cannot be tracked easily<br/><br/>Absence of physical barrier in the internet world<br/><br/>Cyber crimes affect large number of people<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>The fact that human mind has unfathomable power is undeniable, which is why internet crimes are increasing at a tremendous rate. Even history has witnessed some of the greatest internet security gone kaput by the hands of hackers, who have easily got away too. The only way to curb such crime is to remain aware of the cyber laws that we have today, that can either be through internet or through website/IT vendors. Information Technology Act has to be balanced in such a way that it proves too stringent for people who are involved in cyber crimes and at the same time it should never hamper the growth of Internet industry.<br/><br/>Author Bio:– Maneet Puri at present is heading a quality web design firm located at New Delhi, India. With unmatchable expertise in technical domain, he has been offering professional web consultation services to his clients located all round the globe. He is also an avid writer and some of his commended work have been published on renowned websites | Webdiensten, leveranciers en cyberwetten!<br/><br/>Bijgewerkt op:April 21, 2014Bilal Ahmad<br/><br/>Computerisering van deze wereld veranderde menselijke prestaties scenario in grote mate en dat ook buiten maat. Bijvoorbeeld, Nu kunt u vitale informatie verzenden over de hele wereld met een enkele muisklik, dankzij internetconnectiviteit. Helaas is het deze brede connectiviteit en populariteit onder mensen, internet heeft ook de kansen op computercriminaliteit verhoogd. Internetcriminaliteit of computercriminaliteit staan algemeen bekend als 'Cybercriminaliteit'.<br/><br/>'Cyber Laws' is iets nieuws in het rechtssysteem, maar heeft de laatste tijd veel aandacht gekregen. De term cybercriminaliteit is zeer synoniem met conventionele criminaliteit, het enige verschil is medium van executie. Er zijn voornamelijk twee soorten cybercriminaliteit, de eerste is waarin computers de belangrijkste doelwitten zijn en deze omvatten gevallen van gegevensschade, kwaadaardige code en zelfs toegang tot criminele gegevens. De tweede is waarin de computer slechts een instrument is waarmee conventionele misdaden worden gepleegd voor bijvoorbeeld cyberterrorisme, spamming, cyberstalking en nog veel meer.<br/><br/>Dit is waar een websiteconsultant of een verkoper op het toneel komt. Hoewel u zich niet bewust bent van alle cyberwetten die tot op heden aanwezig zijn, kan een websiteleverancier u adviseren over enkele van de meest vitale cyberwetten tijdens het maken van uw site.<br/><br/>Dit kan omvatten algemene kennis van kopieerrechten of zelfs het beschermen van de inhoud van uw eigen website. Het uitleggen van alle rechten die u als website-eigenaar bezit, is ook een van de taken die een websiteleverancier kan doen bij het ontwikkelen van uw website. Een leverancier kan u ook helpen door u informatie aan te bieden over verschillende cyberwetten om gegevens te beschermen. Naast dit alles kan een leverancier u ook informatie bieden over eventuele nieuwe cyberwetten die u mogelijk niet kent. Cyberwetten kunnen van land tot land verschillen, een recent voorbeeld kan de cookiewet zijn die in het Verenigd Koninkrijk is uitgebracht, waardoor de website geen browsegegevens van gebruikers kan opslaan. Volgens de Cookiewet kunnen websites in het Verenigd Koninkrijk geen cookiebestanden opslaan zonder toestemming van de surfer.<br/><br/>Het is na de implementatie van een dergelijke wet dat websites nu een pop-upvenster hebben, waarin de toestemming van de bezoeker wordt gevraagd om cookies op te slaan. Dergelijke bestanden worden door websites gebruikt om het surfpatroon van bezoekers te analyseren op basis van welke advertenties vervolgens op een gebruikersvenster worden geplaatst. Met hacken niet meer iets nieuws voor ons allemaal, denk je dat dergelijke regels en voorschriften online vervalsing of cybercriminaliteit kunnen voorkomen? Technologie heeft zich in een snel tempo ontwikkeld, maar nog steeds geven mensen niet de voorkeur aan online winkelen vanwege angst voor persoonlijke of bankrekeninggegevens die worden gehackt. Met de opkomst van cybercriminaliteit is de behoefte aan strenge cyberwetten ook toegenomen om hetzelfde te beperken en een risicovrije winkelervaring te bevorderen.<br/><br/>Categorieën van cybercriminaliteit<br/><br/>In de loop der jaren zijn er drie belangrijke klassen van cybercriminaliteit geweest:<br/><br/>Ongeautoriseerde toegang tot computersysteemgevallen, waarbij gebruikersnamen en wachtwoorden worden gehackt of gestolen om toegang te krijgen tot persoonlijke informatie van de betreffende gebruiker. Dit soort toegang tot de achterdeur wordt georganiseerd met behulp van Trojan Horse. Het vrijgeven van kwaadaardige programma’s zoals Trojan House, wormen of computervirussen etc. De laatste klasse omvat cyberstalking van een gebruiker of online intimidatie.<br/><br/>Directe implicaties van cybercriminaliteit<br/><br/>Vermindering van de omzet<br/><br/>Vermindering van personeelsoutput als gevolg van netwerkvertragingen<br/><br/>Verlies van gepersonaliseerde informatie, zoals onderzoek<br/><br/>Onderbreking van het communicatieproces<br/><br/>Indirecte implicaties van cybercriminaliteit<br/><br/>Geloofwaardigheidsprobleem in ons financiële systeem<br/><br/>Merkimago wordt bezoedeld in de markt<br/><br/>Cybercriminaliteit beïnvloedt zakelijke relatie in de markt<br/><br/>Gevoel van vertrouwen in staatsbeleid en overheidsinstanties is verloren<br/><br/>Voorkomen van cybercriminaliteit<br/><br/>Als netizens zijn er bepaalde voorzorgsmaatregelen die we moeten overwegen voor een veilige en veilige online ervaring. Hier zijn enkele van hen:<br/><br/>Het eerste wat je moet doen is om persoonlijke informatie voor jezelf te houden en te voorkomen dat je dezelfde informatie online deelt.<br/><br/>Vermijd het delen van foto's met vrienden of vreemden.<br/><br/>Het installeren van de nieuwste versie van anti-virus op uw systeem kan u een goede verdedigingslinie bieden tegen internetbedreigingen zoals virussen en malware.<br/><br/>Het bijhouden van uw waardevolle gegevens is een goede optie om problemen zoals virusbesmetting te voorkomen.<br/><br/>Vermijd het verzenden van creditcardgegevens naar sites die onbeveiligd zijn en geen geldig certificaat hebben.<br/><br/>Het installeren van een beveiligingsprogramma dat u controle biedt over websitecookies en voorkomt dat u wordt gevolgd door websites.<br/><br/>Het plaatsen van host-gebaseerde inbraakdetectieapparaten op servers helpt u bij het bijhouden van onregelmatigheden in uw websiteverkeer.<br/><br/>Gebruik van een firewall wordt geadviseerd.<br/><br/>Waarom zijn cyberaanvallen zo populair?<br/><br/>Goedkoper dan traditionele bedrogsmethoden<br/><br/>Het opsporen van cybercriminaliteit is niet eenvoudig<br/><br/>Exacte locaties kunnen niet eenvoudig worden gevolgd<br/><br/>Afwezigheid van fysieke barrière in de internetwereld<br/><br/>Cybercriminaliteit treft een groot aantal mensen<br/><br/>Conclusie<br/><br/>Het feit dat de menselijke geest ondoorgrondelijke macht heeft, is onmiskenbaar, dat is de reden waarom internetcriminaliteit in een enorm tempo toeneemt. Zelfs de geschiedenis is getuige geweest van enkele van de grootste internetbeveiliging die kapot is gegaan door hackers, die ook gemakkelijk zijn ontsnapt. De enige manier om dergelijke criminaliteit tegen te gaan is om op de hoogte te blijven van de cyberwetten die we vandaag hebben, dat kan zijn via internet of via website / IT-leveranciers. De wet op de informatietechnologie moet zodanig in evenwicht zijn dat het te streng is voor mensen die betrokken zijn bij cybercriminaliteit en tegelijkertijd de groei van de internetindustrie nooit mag belemmeren.<br/><br/>Auteur Bio:– Maneet Puri leidt momenteel een kwalitatief webdesignbedrijf gevestigd in New Delhi, India.
