| Leclaire<br/><br/>The historic Leclaire neighborhood, once referred to as Edwardsville's "suburb to the south," was founded as a cooperative community in 1890 and remained a separate village until annexed to the city of Edwardsville in 1934. Newspapers and magazines throughout the United States and Europe reported on the Leclaire experiment, particularly during the first 20 years of its existence. In 1979, due to its unique history, the former village was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.<br/><br/>Leclaire was founded by Nelson Oliver Nelson, a St. Louis plumbing manufacturer who, for many years, sought to advance the plight of the working class. Nelson wanted to improve working conditions for his employees and provide housing near the factories so workers and their families could easily participate in recreational and educational programs offered free of charge by the company. Prior to 1890, while still in St. Louis, the N. O. Nelson Company's manufacturing and distribution businesses began providing profit sharing along with educational and recreational opportunities. The Leclaire cooperative experiment would bring additional benefits.<br/><br/>When Nelson employees indicated they wanted to relocate to a rural location, company representatives approached leaders of small towns in several Missouri and Illinois communities near their St. Louis headquarters. They were looking for a suitable property to build new factories and a model village. South of Edwardsville they found a 125-acre tract of land with access to water, coal, and transportation. Local businessmen acted quickly to offer a financial incentive. In less than three weeks, the community raised a fund of $20,000 from individual contributions of between $1 and $1,000 to entice Nelson to choose Edwardsville for his enterprise.<br/><br/>City leaders had hoped to locate property inside the city limits of Edwardsville, but when no suitable site could be found, they were confident that the Nelson investment south of town would soon become a part of Edwardsville. Although Nelson fulfilled all the contingencies for construction and job creation in his contract, it would be 44 years before annexation to Edwardsville. Leclaire, bounded by Madison/Brown Avenues to the east, the railroad tracks to the west, Hadley/McKinley Avenues on the south and Wolf Street to the north, remained an independent village from 1890 to 1934. During that time it earned a reputation for innovations in business, education and residential planning.<br/><br/>The village of Leclaire on a 1931 map of Edwardsville<br/>Courtesy of Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's decision to build a village was not made on a whim. By the late 1880s he was an international leader in the fields of cooperation and profit-sharing, exchanging social theories with others around the world while expanding his St. Louis business. He named his experimental village after the Parisian profit-sharer, Edme Jean Leclaire, but he visited many other social visionaries who provided information and inspiration. Compiling the best ideas from these examples, Nelson founded Leclaire to, in his words, "give work, promote intelligence, provide recreation, foster beauty, and make homes." These were all factors he determined necessary for men to lead fulfilling lives. Later writers used these words to formulate Leclaire's founding principles: Work, Homes, Education, Recreation, and Beauty, but with the additional important principle of Freedom.<br/><br/>Work<br/><br/>Work could be considered the most important of these factors since without the factory jobs in Leclaire, there would be no village. The brick factory buildings were designed by architect E. A. Cameron to provide natural light, ventilation in the summer, and heated floors in the winter. There was a fire suppression system and, although industrial accidents were not eliminated, every effort was made to guarantee the safety of the workers. The ivy-covered brick buildings were surrounded by well-manicured lawns and flower gardens giving the complex a campus-like appearance. In 1894, New York World reporter Nellie Bly called the buildings "the ideal perfection of buildings for man to labor in".<br/><br/>The manufacturing complex of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>From Friends of Leclaire<br/><br/>Nelson company policies were designed to protect the financial stability of employees. Workers could earn a share of the profits and have a voice in the company if they chose that option. The profit-sharing plan gave Nelson employees a pride of ownership that resulted in a supportive workforce. There were a few short-lived labor strikes over the years, but for the most part, labor problems were rare. Workers also had reasonable hours and competitive wages. There was a provident fund that provided for pensions and sick leave, as well as widow pensions if a worker died, whether or not the death was related to his employment.<br/><br/>Company headquarters for the N. O. Nelson Company (NONCO) remained in St. Louis, but all of the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company was moved to Leclaire. The manufacturing company was divided into shops that made a variety of products. In 1900, the shops became independent companies for tax purposes, but all were still owned by the N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. The shops included the Cabinet Mill where wood products from cabinetry to millwork were produced. The skilled craftsmen that worked here also fulfilled special contracts, including teller cages for a local bank and an altar still in use at St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop specialized in architectural marble that was cut and installed by Nelson crews in homes, businesses, and even state capitols throughout the Midwest. The Machine Shop, which became Bignall and Keeler, made pipe fitting machines, pumps, gauges, and various mechanical tools expected in the plumbing trade. They also branched out to manufacture specialty items like the Leclaire Bicycle in the mid-1890s. The Brass Shop included a foundry where various plumbing pipes and tools were manufactured. These examples represent just some of the work done in the Leclaire factories. The company's logo was a stylized "NONCO" that can still be seen on plumbing fixtures and some fire hydrants in Edwardsville today.<br/><br/>Homes<br/><br/>Before homes could be built, housing was needed for workers who were completing the factory buildings as well as building homes. To meet those needs, the company built the "Club House," a large building that served many purposes. In addition to lodging, it was the community's first educational building, and it contained a well-stocked library.<br/><br/>Construction of the residential portion of Leclaire began immediately after the village was founded in June of 1890. Julius Pitzman, the innovative landscape architect who laid out the first lots in Leclaire, set them up with a number of protective covenants. The covenants provided for wide, curvilinear streets, large lots, and a deed restriction that limited the properties to residential or educational purposes only. The company paved the streets, provided electric street lights, installed sidewalks, and planted hundreds of trees along the streets of Leclaire. Later sections of Leclaire were laid out with a conventional grid design and smaller lots, but still included the deed restrictions.<br/><br/>A Leclaire Victorian cottage in 1907<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Initially the homes were built by the company and then sold at near cost to Nelson employees to encourage home ownership. If a worker became ill and could not make his mortgage, payments were suspended until after he returned to work. The homes were offered in a variety of house designs and the company advertised that no two dwellings were alike. The earliest homes were primarily Victorian cottages that came with electricity and running water. These were followed by bungalows, foursquares, and even some kit homes. Residents could purchase a company-built home or buy an empty lot and build a house themselves, provided the architectural design met company standards.<br/><br/>In later years, lots were sold to investors, usually Edwardsville residents, and many homes in the 1920s were built by local contractors who then sold them to area residents.<br/><br/>Education<br/><br/>Nelson believed in education for everyone, including the working class. Educational programming began with a kindergarten at the Club House in 1892 and continued in the new educational building at 722 Holyoake Road. Commonly called the "School House," this building provided a large hall for meetings and programs, but had moveable partitions to divide it into classroom space during the day. In the evenings, there were dances, meetings, or programs of the Leclaire Self-Culture Club which featured weekly lectures by Washington University professors or nationally known speakers who, like N. O. Nelson, were part of the social betterment movement at the turn of the century. These included Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, and author Charlotte Perkins Gilman, among others.<br/><br/>Children enrolled in the Leclaire kindergarten in 1913<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In the ten years following the 1895 construction of the education building, there were a series of educational experiments including an industrial school, college, night school, and an academy. The earliest and longest-lived endeavor was the morning kindergarten, founded in 1892, that used the Fröbel Model. This two-year program was free to everyone, including Edwardsville children, until 1931 when for financial reasons the company began charging tuition to students who were not the children of employees. Nelson Manufacturing operated a kindergarten until 1934 when the building was turned over to the Edwardsville School District for a nominal fee.<br/><br/>Recreation<br/><br/>Boaters on Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreation was an important feature of Leclaire. The company provided sports facilities for baseball, tennis, and later, football. A bowling and billiard hall was constructed and there was a lake for boating, swimming, fishing, or ice skating in winter. Leclaire Park was furnished with boathouses, male & female bath houses, and a large pavilion. Residents organized dances, hayrides, spelling bees, and other activities, and the company sponsored a band that played regularly at entertainments in the village or in Edwardsville. Like the educational functions at the Club House and School House, the recreational facilities at Leclaire were open to all and were often a destination for Edwardsville and even St. Louis visitors.<br/><br/>Beauty<br/><br/>Early photograph of Leclaire Lake<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>The last of the factors Nelson deemed important for a satisfying life concerned the environment. Nelson knew about the importance of healthy living. He valued the beauty and cleanliness that could be found in the country, and encouraged all in Leclaire to beautify their property by planting gardens and orchards. Nelson himself led by example, so a company greenhouse provided free flowers and competitions were held for the most beautiful yards. Leclaire was laid out so that the entire village had a park-like setting still evident today.<br/><br/>Freedom<br/><br/>The Leclaire Cooperative store<br/>From Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson listed five founding principles for Leclaire, but modern writers add a sixth: Freedom. All of the programs offered by the company were available to employees as well as local residents, but none were mandatory. The freedom to choose whether or not to participate in company programs was entirely up to the individual. Residents of Leclaire could work for Nelson Manufacturing or elsewhere, and workers were under no obligation to live in Leclaire. Participation in recreational and educational programs was also optional. There was also a company store where employees could shop, but unlike other company towns, no one was in debt to the company store. The Leclaire Store was a cooperative where members were charged fair market prices, but were then paid quarterly dividends.<br/><br/>A Different Company Town<br/><br/>All of these benefits made Leclaire unique from other company towns. But there were also individual instances where the company showed compassion and care for the employees. The company closed the factories and hired excursion trains to take workers and their families to St. Louis for a day at the 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. When money was tight, Nelson would occasionally place extra cash in each pay envelope to make life easier for workers, and if he instituted a program the men did not agree with, they talked it out and, as often as not, Nelson would reverse himself.<br/><br/>Born in Lillesand, Norway, in 1841, N. O. Nelson was a complicated man. He was a capitalist who believed in free enterprise, but also a socialist, a follower of the "Golden Rule", and a patriot who served for the Union in the Civil War. By 1900, he was a multimillionaire, but by the time of his death in 1922, he had given it all away for the betterment of the working class.<br/><br/>Although Leclaire was not Nelson's only social experiment, it is considered his most successful endeavor. Other major efforts for social betterment included a chain of co-operative grocery stores in New Orleans, a kindergarten for the children of black employees in his Bessemer, Alabama, factories, and a home for consumptives in Indio, California.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire was renowned internationally as a noteworthy and successful experiment. It was described in the New York World on numerous occasions but in particular by reporter Nellie Bly in 1894 who wrote at length about the model town where "The labor question is solved and everybody happy in a little village near St. Louis." The Los Angeles Times also regularly reported on N. O. Nelson, as did the Chicago Daily Tribune and numerous other publications.<br/><br/>In a speech at Leclaire's 15th anniversary celebration in 1915, Nelson said, "Leclaire extends to you a wide open hospitality, and bids you enjoy today the ease and comfort and beauty and inspiration which we enjoy every day." More than a century has passed since that day, but the invitation still stands. Residents and researchers are invited to learn about Leclaire's history and consider the lessons that might be learned for the betterment of future generations.<br/><br/>One of the former buildings of the manufacturing complex in 2019, which now serves as the N. O. Nelson Campus of Lewis and Clark Community College<br/>Photo by Ben Ostermeier<br/><br/>Friends of Leclaire, organized in 1990 following Leclaire's Centennial celebration, promotes the history of Leclaire through a website (historic-leclaire.org), publications, and a festival, Leclaire Parkfest, held annually on the third Sunday in October | Leclaire<br/><br/>De historische wijk Leclaire, ooit aangeduid als Edwardsville's "voorstad naar het zuiden", werd opgericht als een coöperatieve gemeenschap in 1890 en bleef een apart dorp totdat geannexeerd aan de stad Edwardsville in 1934. Kranten en tijdschriften in de Verenigde Staten en Europa rapporteerden over het Leclaire-experiment, vooral tijdens de eerste 20 jaar van zijn bestaan. In 1979, vanwege zijn unieke geschiedenis, werd het voormalige dorp opgenomen in het Nationaal Register van Historische Plaatsen.<br/><br/>Leclaire werd opgericht door Nelson Oliver Nelson, een fabrikant van sanitair in St. Louis, die jarenlang probeerde de situatie van de arbeidersklasse te bevorderen. Nelson wilde de arbeidsomstandigheden voor zijn werknemers verbeteren en huisvesting bieden in de buurt van de fabrieken, zodat werknemers en hun gezinnen gemakkelijk konden deelnemen aan recreatieve en educatieve programma's die gratis door het bedrijf werden aangeboden. Voorafgaand aan 1890, terwijl nog in St. Louis, de N. O. Nelson Company's productie en distributie bedrijven begonnen met het delen van de winst samen met educatieve en recreatieve mogelijkheden. Het coöperatieve experiment van Leclaire zou extra voordelen opleveren.<br/><br/>Toen werknemers van Nelson aangaven dat ze naar een landelijke locatie wilden verhuizen, benaderden bedrijfsvertegenwoordigers leiders van kleine steden in verschillende Missouri- en Illinois-gemeenschappen in de buurt van hun hoofdkantoor in St. Louis. Ze waren op zoek naar een geschikt pand om nieuwe fabrieken en een modeldorp te bouwen. Ten zuiden van Edwardsville vonden ze een stuk land van 125 hectare met toegang tot water, steenkool en transport. Lokale zakenlieden handelden snel om een financiële stimulans te bieden. In minder dan drie weken verzamelde de gemeenschap een fonds van $ 20.000 uit individuele bijdragen van tussen $ 1 en $ 1.000 om Nelson te verleiden om Edwardsville te kiezen voor zijn bedrijf.<br/><br/>Stadsleiders hadden gehoopt om onroerend goed te vinden binnen de stadsgrenzen van Edwardsville, maar toen er geen geschikte site kon worden gevonden, waren ze ervan overtuigd dat de Nelson-investering ten zuiden van de stad binnenkort een deel van Edwardsville zou worden. Hoewel Nelson voldeed aan alle contingenten voor de bouw en het creëren van banen in zijn contract, zou het 44 jaar voor de annexatie van Edwardsville. Leclaire, begrensd door Madison / Brown Avenues in het oosten, de spoorlijnen in het westen, Hadley / McKinley Avenues in het zuiden en Wolf Street in het noorden, bleef een onafhankelijk dorp van 1890 tot 1934. Gedurende die tijd verdiende het een reputatie voor innovaties in het bedrijfsleven, onderwijs en residentiële planning.<br/><br/>Het dorp Leclaire op een 1931 kaart van Edwardsville<br/>Met dank aan Paul Jenkins<br/><br/>Nelson's beslissing om een dorp te bouwen werd niet op een grillige manier gemaakt. Tegen het einde van de jaren 1880 was hij een internationale leider op het gebied van samenwerking en winstdeling, het uitwisselen van sociale theorieën met anderen over de hele wereld, terwijl het uitbreiden van zijn bedrijf in St. Louis. Hij vernoemde zijn experimentele dorp naar de Parijse winstbejager Edme Jean Leclaire, maar bezocht vele andere sociale visionairs die informatie en inspiratie verstrekten. Nelson stelde de beste ideeën uit deze voorbeelden samen en richtte Leclaire op om, in zijn woorden, "werk te geven, intelligentie te bevorderen, ontspanning te bieden, schoonheid te bevorderen en huizen te maken." Dit waren allemaal factoren die hij noodzakelijk achtte voor mannen om een bevredigend leven te leiden. Latere schrijvers gebruikten deze woorden om Leclaire's grondbeginselen te formuleren: werk, huizen, onderwijs, recreatie en schoonheid, maar met het extra belangrijke principe van vrijheid.<br/><br/>Werken<br/><br/>Werk zou als de belangrijkste van deze factoren kunnen worden beschouwd, want zonder de fabrieksbanen in Leclaire zou er geen dorp zijn. De bakstenen fabrieksgebouwen werden ontworpen door architect E. A. Cameron om natuurlijk licht, ventilatie in de zomer en verwarmde vloeren in de winter te bieden. Er was een brandbestrijdingssysteem en hoewel industriële ongevallen niet werden geëlimineerd, werd alles in het werk gesteld om de veiligheid van de werknemers te garanderen. De met klimop bedekte bakstenen gebouwen werden omringd door goed gemanipuleerde gazons en bloementuinen die het complex een campus-achtige uitstraling gaven. In 1894 noemde New York World reporter Nellie Bly de gebouwen "de ideale perfectie van gebouwen voor de mens om in te werken".<br/><br/>Het productiecomplex van de N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company in Leclaire<br/>Vrienden van Leclaire<br/><br/>Het beleid van het bedrijf Nelson was ontworpen om de financiële stabiliteit van de werknemers te beschermen. Werknemers konden een deel van de winst verdienen en een stem in het bedrijf hebben als ze die optie kozen. Het winstdelingsplan gaf Nelson-medewerkers een trots van eigendom, wat resulteerde in een ondersteunend personeelsbestand. Er waren enkele stakingen van korte duur in de loop der jaren, maar voor het grootste deel waren arbeidsproblemen zeldzaam. Werknemers hadden ook redelijke uren en concurrerende lonen. Er was een voorzieningsfonds dat voorziet in pensioenen en ziekteverlof, evenals weduwenpensioenen als een werknemer overleed, ongeacht of de dood verband hield met zijn werk.<br/><br/>Het hoofdkantoor van de N.O. Nelson Company (NONCO) bleef in St. Louis, maar alle N.O. Nelson Manufacturing Company werd verplaatst naar Leclaire. Het productiebedrijf was verdeeld in winkels die een verscheidenheid aan producten maakten. In 1900 werden de winkels onafhankelijke bedrijven voor fiscale doeleinden, maar alle waren nog steeds eigendom van de N. O. Nelson Manufacturing Company. De winkels omvatten de Cabinet Mill, waar houtproducten van kasten tot molens werden geproduceerd. De bekwame ambachtslieden die hier werkten, vervulden ook speciale contracten, waaronder tellerkooien voor een lokale bank en een altaar dat nog steeds in gebruik is in de St. Andrew's Episcopal Church in Edwardsville. The Marble Shop is gespecialiseerd in architectonisch marmer dat werd gesneden en geïnstalleerd door Nelson-crews in huizen, bedrijven en zelfs staatshoofdsteden in het hele Midwesten. De Machine Shop, die Bignall en Keeler werd, maakte pijpfittingsmachines, pompen, meters en verschillende mechanische gereedschappen die in de sanitairindustrie verwacht werden. Ze vertakten zich ook om gespecialiseerde items zoals de Leclaire-fiets in het midden van de jaren 1890 te produceren. De Messingwinkel omvatte een gieterij waar verschillende leidingen en gereedschappen werden vervaardigd. Deze voorbeelden vertegenwoordigen slechts een deel van het werk dat in de fabrieken van Leclaire werd gedaan. Het logo van het bedrijf was een gestileerd "NONCO" dat nog steeds te zien is op loodgieterswerk en enkele brandkranen in Edwardsville.<br/><br/>Woningen<br/><br/>Voordat huizen konden worden gebouwd, was huisvesting nodig voor werknemers die de fabrieksgebouwen en de bouw van huizen voltooiden. Om aan die behoeften te voldoen, bouwde het bedrijf het "Clubhuis", een groot gebouw dat vele doeleinden diende. Naast accommodatie, was het het eerste educatieve gebouw van de gemeenschap, en het bevatte een goed gevulde bibliotheek.<br/><br/>De bouw van het woongedeelte van Leclaire begon onmiddellijk na de oprichting van het dorp in juni 1890. Julius Pitzman, de innovatieve landschapsarchitect die de eerste kavels in Leclaire aanlegde, zette ze op met een aantal beschermende convenanten. De verdragen voorzien in brede, kronkelende straten, grote kavels en een daadbeperking die de eigendommen beperkt tot residentiële of educatieve doeleinden alleen. Het bedrijf verhardde de straten, zorgde voor elektrische straatverlichting, installeerde trottoirs en plantte honderden bomen langs de straten van Leclaire. Latere secties van Leclaire werden aangelegd met een conventioneel roosterontwerp en kleinere kavels, maar omvatten nog steeds de aktebeperkingen.<br/><br/>Een Victoriaans huisje in 1907<br/>van Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Aanvankelijk werden de huizen gebouwd door het bedrijf en vervolgens tegen bijna kosten verkocht aan Nelson-medewerkers om huiseigendom aan te moedigen. Als een werknemer ziek werd en zijn hypotheek niet kon maken, werden de betalingen opgeschort tot nadat hij terugkeerde naar het werk. De huizen werden aangeboden in verschillende huisontwerpen en het bedrijf kondigde aan dat geen twee woningen hetzelfde waren. De vroegste huizen waren voornamelijk Victoriaanse huisjes die werden geleverd met elektriciteit en stromend water. Deze werden gevolgd door bungalows, vierkantjes en zelfs een aantal kitwoningen. Bewoners konden een bedrijfsgebouw kopen of een leeg perceel kopen en zelf een huis bouwen, mits het architectonische ontwerp aan de bedrijfsnormen voldeed.<br/><br/>In latere jaren werden er veel verkocht aan investeerders, meestal inwoners van Edwardsville, en veel huizen in de jaren 1920 werden gebouwd door lokale aannemers die ze vervolgens verkochten aan bewoners van het gebied.<br/><br/>Onderwijs<br/><br/>Nelson geloofde in onderwijs voor iedereen, inclusief de arbeidersklasse. Educatieve programmering begon met een kleuterschool in het Clubhuis in 1892 en ging verder in het nieuwe educatieve gebouw op 722 Holyoake Road. Dit gebouw, dat gewoonlijk het "School House" wordt genoemd, bood een grote zaal voor vergaderingen en programma's, maar had beweegbare scheidingswanden om het overdag in klaslokalen te verdelen. In de avonden waren er dansen, vergaderingen of programma's van de Leclaire Self-Culture Club die wekelijkse lezingen door professoren van de Universiteit van Washington of nationaal bekende sprekers die, zoals N. O. Nelson, deel uitmaakten van de sociale verbeteringsbeweging aan de beurt van de eeuw. Deze omvatten Jane Addams, Edward Everett Hale, Samuel "Golden Rule" Jones, en auteur Charlotte Perkins Gilman, onder anderen.<br/><br/>Kinderen ingeschreven in de Leclaire kleuterschool in 1913<br/>van Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>In de tien jaar na de bouw van het onderwijsgebouw in 1895 waren er een reeks educatieve experimenten, waaronder een industriële school, een universiteit, een nachtschool en een academie. De vroegste en langst geleefde onderneming was de ochtendkleuterschool, opgericht in 1892, die het Fröbel-model gebruikte. Dit tweejarige programma was gratis voor iedereen, met inbegrip van Edwardsville kinderen, tot 1931 toen om financiële redenen het bedrijf begon het collegegeld aan te rekenen aan studenten die niet de kinderen van werknemers waren. Nelson Manufacturing beheerde een kleuterschool tot 1934 toen het gebouw werd overgedragen aan het Edwardsville School District voor een nominale vergoeding.<br/><br/>Recreatie<br/><br/>Boten op Leclaire Lake in 1915<br/>van Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Recreatie was een belangrijk kenmerk van Leclaire. Het bedrijf verzorgde sportfaciliteiten voor honkbal, tennis en later voetbal. Er werd een bowling- en biljartzaal gebouwd en er was een meer voor varen, zwemmen, vissen of schaatsen in de winter. Leclaire Park was ingericht met boothuizen, mannelijke en vrouwelijke badhuizen, en een groot paviljoen. Bewoners organiseerden dansen, hayrides, spellingbijen en andere activiteiten, en het bedrijf sponsorde een band die regelmatig speelde bij amusement in het dorp of in Edwardsville. Net als de educatieve functies in het Club House en School House, waren de recreatieve voorzieningen in Leclaire open voor iedereen en waren vaak een bestemming voor bezoekers van Edwardsville en zelfs St. Louis.<br/><br/>Schoonheid<br/><br/>Vroege foto van Leclaire Lake<br/>van Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>De laatste van de factoren die Nelson belangrijk achtte voor een bevredigend leven ging over het milieu. Nelson wist over het belang van een gezond leven. Hij waardeerde de schoonheid en netheid die in het land te vinden waren, en moedigde iedereen in Leclaire aan om hun eigendom te verfraaien door tuinen en boomgaarden te planten. Nelson zelf leidde door voorbeeld, dus een bedrijfskas zorgde voor gratis bloemen en er werden wedstrijden gehouden voor de mooiste tuinen. Leclaire werd zo aangelegd dat het hele dorp nog steeds een parkachtige omgeving had.<br/><br/>Vrijheid<br/><br/>De Leclaire Coöperatieve winkel<br/>van Cindy Reinhardt<br/><br/>Nelson noemde vijf basisprincipes voor Leclaire, maar moderne schrijvers voegen een zesde toe: Vrijheid. Alle programma's die door het bedrijf werden aangeboden, waren beschikbaar voor werknemers en lokale bewoners, maar geen waren verplicht. De vrijheid om al dan niet deel te nemen aan bedrijfsprogramma's was geheel aan het individu. Inwoners van Leclaire konden voor Nelson Manufacturing of elders werken, en werknemers waren niet verplicht om in Leclaire te wonen. Deelname aan recreatieve en educatieve programma's was ook optioneel. Er was ook een bedrijfswinkel waar werknemers konden winkelen, maar in tegenstelling tot andere bedrijfssteden was niemand in de schulden bij de bedrijfswinkel. De Leclaire Store was een coöperatie waar leden faire marktprijzen in rekening werden gebracht, maar vervolgens kwartaaldividend werden uitbetaald.<br/><br/>Een andere ondernemingsstad<br/><br/>Al deze voordelen maakten Leclaire uniek uit andere bedrijfssteden. Maar er waren ook individuele gevallen waar het bedrijf medeleven en zorg voor de medewerkers toonde. Het bedrijf sloot de fabrieken en huurde excursietreinen om werknemers en hun families naar St. Louis te brengen voor een dag op de 1904 St. Louis World's Fair. Wanneer het geld krap was, plaatste Nelson af en toe extra geld in elke loonenvelop om het leven gemakkelijker te maken voor de arbeiders, en als hij een programma instelde waar de mannen het niet mee eens waren, spraken ze het uit en, zo vaak als niet, zou Nelson zichzelf omkeren.<br/><br/>N. O. Nelson, geboren in Lillesand, Noorwegen, in 1841, was een gecompliceerd man. Hij was een kapitalist die geloofde in vrije onderneming, maar ook een socialist, een volgeling van de "Golden Rule", en een patriot die in de Burgeroorlog voor de Unie diende. Tegen 1900 was hij een multimiljonair, maar tegen de tijd van zijn dood in 1922 had hij alles weggegeven voor de verbetering van de arbeidersklasse.<br/><br/>Hoewel Leclaire niet Nelsons enige sociale experiment was, wordt het beschouwd als zijn meest succesvolle poging. Andere grote inspanningen voor sociale verbetering waren een keten van coöperatieve supermarkten in New Orleans, een kleuterschool voor de kinderen van zwarte werknemers in zijn Bessemer, Alabama, fabrieken en een thuis voor consumenten in Indio, Californië.<br/><br/>Nelson's Village of Leclaire werd internationaal erkend als een opmerkelijk en succesvol experiment. Het werd beschreven in de New York World bij tal van gelegenheden, maar in het bijzonder door verslaggever Nellie Bly in 1894 die uitgebreid schreef over de modelstad waar "De arbeidsvraag is opgelost en iedereen gelukkig in een klein dorpje in de buurt van St. Louis." De Los Angeles Times rapporteerde ook regelmatig over N.O. Nelson, evenals de Chicago Daily Tribune en tal van andere publicaties.<br/><br/>In een toespraak op Leclaire's 15-jarig jubileum in 1915, Nelson zei: "Leclaire strekt zich uit tot u een brede open gastvrijheid, en vraagt u vandaag genieten van het gemak en comfort en schoonheid en inspiratie die we genieten van elke dag." Sinds die dag is er meer dan een eeuw verstreken, maar de uitnodiging staat nog steeds. Inwoners en onderzoekers worden uitgenodigd om meer te weten te komen over de geschiedenis van Leclaire en de lessen te overwegen die kunnen worden geleerd voor de verbetering van toekomstige generaties.<br/><br/>Een van de voormalige gebouwen van het productiecomplex in 2019, dat nu dient als de N.

| Author Visits via Zoom or Skype<br/><br/>I'm excited to visit with your students via Zoom or Skype! Skype is a great option for schools/classes who aren't bringing in in-person authors, but who want to explore books and poetry, connect with an author, and ask one-on-one questions.<br/><br/>Cost<br/><br/>I offer 30-45-minute Zoom or Skype visits with schools for $125 per session (or $200 for two sessions happening within three hours in the morning or the afternoon; $325 for three sessions in one day; $425 for four sessions in one day). In each session, I try to get kids as actively involved as possible. No, it's not the same kind of connection as an in-person visit offers, but it can still be inspiring and motivating for kids!<br/><br/>What I Do<br/><br/>Each session for up to 50 students includes:<br/><br/>5 minutes of tech set-up<br/><br/>3 segments of 10ish-minutes each — You choose from:<br/><br/>How I became a writer<br/><br/>Writing this particular book (you choose which book I focus on)<br/><br/>Reading (I read some poems and kids help me read others)<br/><br/>Classroom presentation (your students put on a reading or performance for me—a very appreciative audience!)<br/><br/>Writing a poem together<br/><br/>Question and answer session<br/><br/>5 minutes of wrap-ups/goodbyes<br/><br/>I also chat with classes of pre-service teachers or groups of in-service teachers about poetry and writing.<br/><br/>Tips for a Great Virtual Visit<br/><br/>Tips for a Successful Virtual Visit<br/><br/>One of my goals for virtual school visits is to capture the interactivity that makes in-person visits successful and fun. But the truth is that sometimes it's tough to be virtually interactive! The timing might not sync up correctly, which makes reading together a challenge, and it's really hard for me to hear individual students unless they come up and speak directly into the microphone/computer. But after some trial and error, I've discovered some ways to have the best virtual visits possible. Here they are: 10 ways to make my visit with your students a great experience!<br/><br/>Before the Visit<br/><br/>Get kids as excited as possible about the visit. Visit my website with them. Read some of my books with them. Gather some questions students have for me. Anything you do ahead of time to make it feel like a BIG DEAL will go a long way toward student engagement.<br/><br/>Position the video camera or laptop with webcam so that I can see as much of the audience as possible. It's hard to assess student engagement when I can only see a couple of students.<br/><br/>Limit each group to 50 students. It's incredibly hard to engage large groups via video.<br/><br/>I'll move quickly from topic to topic or poem to poem. Please remind students that they'll need to listen closely to understand what's going on.<br/><br/>Occasionally, I do a little Reader's Theater with students. If I send you any scripted student parts ahead of time, print a copy for EACH session and cut into pieces, if needed.<br/><br/>During the Visit<br/><br/>When I discuss a book, if you have that printed book, please hold it up for students to see.<br/><br/>You are my proxy. I often can't call on students and hear individual replies. So, I might say, "We're going to get 3 ideas. Raise your hand if you have an idea." Then YOU take over, call on three students, and announce those answers to everyone in the room and to me.<br/><br/>Choose confident, outgoing students for scripted student parts (if I send any ahead of time). During my in-person school visits, I try to draw out some of the less confident students, but I've found that this doesn't work as well during virtual visits because I can't hear them.<br/><br/>Have students with speaking parts sit up front. When it's time, have them stand up and remind them to speak loudly.<br/><br/>In virtual visits, behavior management falls solely on you. I often can't see exactly what's going on, so do please step in as needed. If there's a big disruption, just ask me to hold on for a moment so that I don't chatter on while nobody's paying attention:>)<br/><br/>Feel free to take pictures of me on-screen and share on social media–even though pictures of me often look ridiculous because I'm making funny faces or something while I read!<br/><br/>If you have any questions at all, please just ask, either before or during the visit!<br/><br/>Scheduling a Virtual Session<br/><br/>Are you interested in scheduling a virtual visit with me? Just email me to set up a date, and we'll go from there | Auteur Bezoeken via Zoom of Skype<br/><br/>Skype is een geweldige optie voor scholen/klassen die niet persoonlijk auteurs meenemen, maar die boeken en poëzie willen verkennen, contact willen maken met een auteur en een een-op-een vragen willen stellen.<br/><br/>Kostprijs<br/><br/>Ik bied 30-45 minuten Zoom- of Skype-bezoeken aan met scholen voor $ 125 per sessie (of $ 200 voor twee sessies die binnen drie uur in de ochtend of in de middag plaatsvinden; $ 325 voor drie sessies op één dag; $ 425 voor vier sessies op één dag). In elke sessie probeer ik kinderen zo actief mogelijk te betrekken. Nee, het is niet hetzelfde soort verbinding als een persoonlijk bezoek biedt, maar het kan nog steeds inspirerend en motiverend zijn voor kinderen!<br/><br/>Wat ik doe<br/><br/>Elke sessie voor maximaal 50 studenten omvat:<br/><br/>5 minuten technische inrichting<br/><br/>3 segmenten van elk 10 minuten — U kiest uit:<br/><br/>Hoe ik schrijver werd<br/><br/>Het schrijven van dit specifieke boek (u kiest welk boek ik focus)<br/><br/>Lezen (ik lees een aantal gedichten en kinderen helpen me om anderen te lezen)<br/><br/>Presentatie in de klas (uw studenten zetten voor mij een lezing of voorstelling op - een zeer waarderend publiek!)<br/><br/>Samen een gedicht schrijven<br/><br/>Vraag-en-antwoord sessie<br/><br/>5 minuten afscheid nemen / afscheid nemen<br/><br/>Ik praat ook met lessen van pre-service docenten of groepen van in-service docenten over poëzie en schrijven.<br/><br/>Tips voor een geweldig virtueel bezoek<br/><br/>Tips voor een succesvol virtueel bezoek<br/><br/>Een van mijn doelen voor virtuele schoolbezoeken is om de interactiviteit vast te leggen die persoonlijke bezoeken succesvol en leuk maakt. Maar de waarheid is dat het soms moeilijk is om virtueel interactief te zijn! De timing kan niet goed synchroniseren, waardoor samen lezen een uitdaging is, en het is echt moeilijk voor mij om individuele studenten te horen, tenzij ze rechtstreeks in de microfoon / computer spreken. Maar na wat trial and error heb ik een aantal manieren ontdekt om de beste virtuele bezoeken mogelijk te maken. Hier zijn ze: 10 manieren om mijn bezoek met uw studenten een geweldige ervaring te maken!<br/><br/>Voor het bezoek<br/><br/>Maak kinderen zo enthousiast mogelijk over het bezoek. Bezoek mijn website met hen. Lees enkele van mijn boeken met hen. Verzamel enkele vragen die studenten voor mij hebben. Alles wat je van tevoren doet om het als een BIG DEAL te laten voelen, gaat een lange weg in de richting van studentenbetrokkenheid.<br/><br/>Plaats de videocamera of laptop met webcam zodat ik zoveel mogelijk van het publiek kan zien. Het is moeilijk om de betrokkenheid van studenten te beoordelen als ik slechts een paar studenten kan zien.<br/><br/>Beperk elke groep tot 50 studenten. Het is ongelooflijk moeilijk om grote groepen via video te betrekken.<br/><br/>Ik ga snel van onderwerp naar onderwerp of gedicht naar gedicht. Herinner studenten eraan dat ze goed moeten luisteren om te begrijpen wat er aan de hand is.<br/><br/>Af en toe doe ik een beetje Reader's Theater met studenten. Als ik je van tevoren gescripte studentonderdelen stuur, print dan een kopie voor ELKE sessie en snijd ze indien nodig in stukken.<br/><br/>Tijdens het bezoek<br/><br/>Wanneer ik een boek bespreek, als je dat gedrukte boek hebt, houd het dan voor studenten om te zien.<br/><br/>Je bent mijn proxy. Ik kan vaak geen studenten bellen en individuele antwoorden horen. Dus, ik zou kunnen zeggen, "We gaan 3 ideeën krijgen. Steek je hand op als je een idee hebt." Dan neem JIJ het over, roep drie studenten op en maak die antwoorden bekend aan iedereen in de kamer en aan mij.<br/><br/>Kies zelfverzekerde, uitgaande studenten voor gescripte studentonderdelen (als ik iets van tevoren stuur). Tijdens mijn persoonlijke schoolbezoeken probeer ik enkele van de minder zelfverzekerde studenten te trekken, maar ik heb ontdekt dat dit niet zo goed werkt tijdens virtuele bezoeken omdat ik ze niet kan horen.<br/><br/>Laat studenten met sprekende delen vooraan zitten en als het tijd is, laat ze dan opstaan en herinner ze eraan om hardop te spreken.<br/><br/>Bij virtuele bezoeken valt gedragsbeheer alleen op jou. Ik kan vaak niet precies zien wat er aan de hand is, dus stap alsjeblieft in als dat nodig is. Als er een grote verstoring is, vraag me dan om even vast te houden, zodat ik niet praat terwijl niemand oplet:>)<br/><br/>Voel je vrij om foto's van mij op het scherm te nemen en te delen op sociale media - hoewel foto's van mij er vaak belachelijk uitzien omdat ik grappige gezichten maak of iets terwijl ik lees!<br/><br/>Als u vragen heeft, vraag het dan gewoon, hetzij voor of tijdens het bezoek!<br/><br/>Een virtuele sessie plannen<br/><br/>Bent u geïnteresseerd in het plannen van een virtueel bezoek met mij? E-mail me gewoon om een datum in te stellen, en we gaan er vanaf |

On the one hand it has prompted stigma and violence and on the other it has brought about constructive and supportive responses from various individuals and groups. A new book, Acting on HIV, edited by Prof. Dennis Francis, Dean of the Faculty of Education at the University of the Free State, looks at how drama can be used to promote vital social change as well as individual behavioural change.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV offers a systematic inquiry into drama as an approach to discuss HIV/AIDS and related attitudes and behaviours. The book is a scholarly text and includes the work of some twenty exceptionally creative authors. Contributing authors to the book include, amongst others, Proff. Hazel Barnes (University of the Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Stellenbosch University) and Yvonne Sliep from the University of KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"This project started in 2009 and has taken much of my time to bring together the work of exceptionally creative authors. The research that is communicated through the book is original and timely and makes a significant contribution to conversations about the role/s and significance of drama in addressing issues of HIV & AIDS," says Prof. Francis | Nieuws Archief<br/><br/>Nieuw boek kijkt naar manieren om HIV-uitdagingen aan te pakken<br/><br/>2011-11-29<br/><br/>Prof. Dennis Francis met Marjorie Human die de omslag van het boek, Acting on HIV.<br/><br/>De hiv-pandemie heeft het beste en slechtste van de mens in termen van respons gebracht. Aan de ene kant heeft het stigma en geweld veroorzaakt en aan de andere kant heeft het constructieve en ondersteunende reacties van verschillende individuen en groepen veroorzaakt. Een nieuw boek, Acting on HIV, uitgegeven door Prof. Dennis Francis, decaan van de faculteit Onderwijs aan de Universiteit van de Vrije Staat, kijkt naar hoe drama kan worden gebruikt om vitale sociale verandering te bevorderen, evenals individuele gedragsverandering.<br/><br/>Acting on HIV biedt een systematisch onderzoek naar drama als een benadering om HIV / AIDS en aanverwante houdingen en gedragingen te bespreken. Het boek is een wetenschappelijke tekst en bevat het werk van ongeveer twintig uitzonderlijk creatieve auteurs. Auteurs van het boek zijn onder andere Proff. Hazel Barnes (Universiteit van de Witwatersrand), Rob Pattman (Universiteit Stellenbosch) en Yvonne Sliep van de Universiteit van KwaZulu-Natal.<br/><br/>"Dit project begon in 2009 en heeft veel van mijn tijd gekost om het werk van uitzonderlijk creatieve auteurs samen te brengen. Het onderzoek dat wordt gecommuniceerd via het boek is origineel en tijdig en levert een belangrijke bijdrage aan gesprekken over de rol(en) en het belang van drama bij het aanpakken van problemen van HIV & AIDS, "zegt prof.

| Storyworld Spotlight<br/><br/>25 years of Tomb Raider<br/><br/>Tomb Raider is one of the most recognizable entertainment properties in the world. Since Lara Croft's first videogame appearance in Tomb Raider (1996), her exploits as an adventurous and quick-witted explorer have resonated widely with players, earning her a place in the pantheon of great pop culture characters. For that reason we will be putting The World of Lara Croft in the Storyworld Spotlight from December 22, 2021 to March 6, 2022.<br/><br/>Crafting a Croft<br/><br/>Lara Croft was created by studio Core Design, in Derby (UK), in 1996.

A game in a 3rd person perspective where players would see the main character in full throughout every scene.<br/><br/>As the game was about 'raiding mysterious tombs deep under pyramids,' the lead character would need to look adventurous, and have the brains to survive complex raiding missions. After some deliberation, Lara Croft was born, a young, upper-class and utterly British woman, who was as enigmatic and intelligent as she was tough and self-reliant.<br/><br/>Success and controversy<br/><br/>Tomb Raider (1996) was a breakaway success for Core Design, who quickly doubled down on building Tomb Raider 2 (1997) and 3 (1998). A big part of the success was attributed to the games' leading lady, who found admirers both with male and female players. This baffled critics who just saw Lara Croft as a sexist cartoon.<br/><br/>Explore The World of Lara Croft in Storyworld<br/><br/>This exhibition explores the successful franchise in-depth. It looks at the history of the games and why its leading lady resonates with so many people. It also dives into the mystery of what makes Tomb Raider games tick, from the deep world building to the clever puzzles and traps, and from fantastic enemy and monster designs to the character design of the legendary heroine.<br/><br/>After all, mysteries are there to explore, and have been for the past 25 years.<br/><br/>Tickets<br/><br/>Buy your tickets for Storyworld online with a start date and entry time from Wednesday December 22.

De studio was op zoek naar een hoofdpersoon voor hun aanstaande 3D-avontuurspel voor PlayStation 1. Een spel in een 3e persoon perspectief waar spelers het hoofdpersonage volledig in elke scène zou zien.<br/><br/>Omdat het spel ging over 'het berijden van mysterieuze graven diep onder piramides', zou het hoofdpersonage er avontuurlijk moeten uitzien en de hersenen moeten hebben om complexe overvalsmissies te overleven.

| Real Estate Word of the Day: Option<br/><br/>Option: An agreement to keep open, for a set period, an offer to sell or lease real property. An option can be used, for example, to give the buyer time to resolve questions of financing, title, zoning and feasibility before committing the buyer to purchase. Options are frequently used in the land assemblage process. The option must be supported by its actual consideration, separate and independent of the purchase price of the property. Mere recital of consideration alone is not sufficient except in a lease-option in which the provisions of the lease are themselves sufficient consideration to support the option. An option merely creates a contractual right; it does not give the optionee any estate in the property. At the time the option is signed, the owner does not sell, nor does the buyer purchase, the property. Although the owner is obligated to sell if given notice by the buyer, the buyer is not obligated to purchase. An option to buy is also known as a call; an option to sell is known as a put. | Onroerend goed woord van de dag: optie<br/><br/>Optie: Een overeenkomst om, voor een bepaalde periode, een aanbod tot verkoop of verhuur van onroerend goed open te houden. Een optie kan bijvoorbeeld worden gebruikt om de koper de tijd te geven om vragen over financiering, titel, zonering en haalbaarheid op te lossen voordat de koper wordt verplicht om te kopen. Opties worden vaak gebruikt in het proces van grondassemblage. De optie moet worden ondersteund door de werkelijke afweging, afzonderlijk en onafhankelijk van de aankoopprijs van het onroerend goed. Alleen de overweging alleen is niet voldoende, behalve bij een lease-optie waarbij de bepalingen van de lease zelf voldoende overweging zijn om de optie te ondersteunen. Een optie creëert alleen een contractueel recht; het geeft de optionee geen onroerend goed in het pand. Op het moment dat de optie wordt ondertekend, verkoopt de eigenaar het pand niet, noch koopt de koper het pand. Hoewel de eigenaar verplicht is om te verkopen, is de koper niet verplicht om te kopen. Een optie om te kopen staat ook bekend als een call; een optie om te verkopen staat bekend als een put. |
| Benefits of Carotenoids for the Skin<br/><br/>Have you heard of carotenoids? These powerful phytochemicals are the pigmented constituents found in plants that give flowers, fruits, and leaves their yellow, orange and red colours.<br/><br/>Since the 1930s, scientists have identified about 800 carotenoids and about 40 are found in the human body, including the outermost layer of the epidermis, the dermis and subcutaneous fat. The most common carotenoids are beta-carotene, alpha-carotene, lutein, zeaxanthin, lycopene, and astaxanthin. You can read more about astaxanthin here.<br/><br/>The content of carotenoids in the skin is influenced by numerous factors, including the intake of fruits and vegetables, their bioavailability from various foods, supplementation, exposure to UV radiation, air pollution, alcohol consumption, smoking and stress.<br/><br/>How do Carotenoids Help My Skin?<br/><br/>Carotenoids are some of the best-known antioxidants for the skin and they also have important functions as anti-inflammatory agents.<br/><br/>Healthy Aging and Skin Repair<br/><br/>Antioxidants are essential for healthy skin because they help to prevent free radical damage to cells. Free radical damage causes premature aging and the onset of various types of skin cancers. Carotenoids, along with vitamin E, vitamin C, and Co enzyme Q10 are important dermal antioxidants.<br/><br/>Due to their antioxidant activity, carotenoids support and encourage collagen and elastin production in the skin. This helps to increase the skin's density, thickness, elasticity, and firmness. Collagen and elastin decrease as we age, so getting enough carotenoids in the diet and topically is critical for aging well.<br/><br/>Carotenoids can improve the signs of photoaging, skin discolouration, elasticity, hydration, texture, and can reduce transepidermal water loss.<br/><br/>Astaxanthin in particular stimulates fibroblasts to produce collagen and elastin, inhibits the activity of the enzymes that breakdown collagen and elastin, and shows anti-inflammatory and UV-filtering effects. It has been shown to reduce melanin in the skin, which results in the decrease in the appearance of freckles and melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activity: the anti-inflammatory activity of carotenoids helps to dampen the inflammation and irritation associated with acne. Carotenoids also help to normalize and balance oil secretions from the sebaceous glands. They are valuable agents in skin repair and they stimulate epidermal regeneration, helping to smooth and soften skin.<br/><br/>Where Can I Find Carotenoids?<br/><br/>There are two ways to get your daily dose of carotenoids: through diet and through topical application. The combination of both is the ideal approach to well-aging skincare.<br/><br/>Carotenoids are fat-soluble, so your body needs fat to absorb them (think tomatoes and olive oil, broccoli and butter, or spinach and avocado). Common sources of carotenoids in food are avocado, egg yolks, kale, spinach, carrots, sweet potatoes, papaya, and tomatoes.<br/><br/>While we advocate getting as many of your nutrients and antioxidants as you can from food rather than supplementation; one study showed that astaxanthin combined with collagen hydrolysate significantly improved barrier integrity, reduced transepidermal water loss, and increased the expression of procollagen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topical application is key to healthy skin. Studies show that high concentrations of antioxidants in human skin offer the best protection for healthy skin at any age.<br/><br/>At Sarka Botanicals, we blend carotenoid-rich, whole plants such as calendula, dandelion, and extracts like astaxanthin with cold-pressed oils and functional ingredients. Calendula alone contains over 19 different types of carotenoids. This may explain why it has such a long history of use in skin care. Studies show that carotenoids blended with co-enzyme Q10 are especially effective at reducing inflammation and slowing premature skin aging due to sun exposure. | Voordelen van carotenoïden voor de huid<br/><br/>Deze krachtige fytochemicaliën zijn de gepigmenteerde bestanddelen die worden aangetroffen in planten die bloemen, vruchten en bladeren hun gele, oranje en rode kleuren geven.<br/><br/>Sinds de jaren 1930 hebben wetenschappers ongeveer 800 carotenoïden geïdentificeerd en ongeveer 40 worden gevonden in het menselijk lichaam, waaronder de buitenste laag van de opperhuid, de dermis en onderhuids vet. De meest voorkomende carotenoïden zijn beta-caroteen, alfa-caroteen, luteïne, zeaxanthine, lycopeen en astaxanthine. U kunt hier meer lezen over astaxanthine.<br/><br/>Het gehalte aan carotenoïden in de huid wordt beïnvloed door tal van factoren, waaronder de inname van groenten en fruit, hun biologische beschikbaarheid uit verschillende voedingsmiddelen, suppletie, blootstelling aan UV-straling, luchtvervuiling, alcoholgebruik, roken en stress.<br/><br/>Hoe helpen carotenoïden mijn huid?<br/><br/>Carotenoïden zijn enkele van de meest bekende antioxidanten voor de huid en ze hebben ook belangrijke functies als ontstekingsremmende middelen.<br/><br/>Gezonde veroudering en huidreparatie<br/><br/>Antioxidanten zijn essentieel voor een gezonde huid omdat ze helpen om schade aan vrije radicalen aan cellen te voorkomen. Vrije radicalenschade veroorzaakt vroegtijdige veroudering en het begin van verschillende soorten huidkankers. Carotenoïden, samen met vitamine E, vitamine C en Co-enzym Q10 zijn belangrijke dermale antioxidanten.<br/><br/>Door hun antioxiderende werking ondersteunen en stimuleren carotenoïden de collageen- en elastineproductie in de huid. Dit helpt om de dichtheid, dikte, elasticiteit en stevigheid van de huid te verhogen. Collageen en elastine dalen naarmate we ouder worden, dus het krijgen van voldoende carotenoïden in het dieet en lokaal is van cruciaal belang voor het goed verouderen.<br/><br/>Carotenoïden kunnen de tekenen van fotoveroudering, huidverkleuring, elasticiteit, hydratatie, textuur verbeteren en transepidermaal waterverlies verminderen.<br/><br/>Astaxanthine stimuleert met name fibroblasten om collageen en elastine te produceren, remt de activiteit van de enzymen die collageen en elastine afbreken, en vertoont ontstekingsremmende en UV-filterende effecten. Het is aangetoond dat het melanine in de huid vermindert, wat resulteert in een afname van het uiterlijk van sproeten en melasma.<br/><br/>Anti-acne activiteit: de ontstekingsremmende activiteit van carotenoïden helpt om de ontsteking en irritatie geassocieerd met acne te dempen. Carotenoïden helpen ook om de oliesecreties van de talgklieren te normaliseren en in evenwicht te brengen. Ze zijn waardevolle agenten in huidherstel en ze stimuleren epidermale regeneratie, helpen om de huid glad te maken en te verzachten.<br/><br/>Waar kan ik carotenoïden vinden?<br/><br/>Er zijn twee manieren om uw dagelijkse dosis carotenoïden te krijgen: door middel van een dieet en door topische toepassing. De combinatie van beide is de ideale aanpak voor een goed verouderende huidverzorging.<br/><br/>Carotenoïden zijn vetoplosbaar, dus je lichaam heeft vet nodig om ze op te nemen (denk aan tomaten en olijfolie, broccoli en boter, of spinazie en avocado). Veel voorkomende bronnen van carotenoïden in voedsel zijn avocado, eigeel, boerenkool, spinazie, wortelen, zoete aardappelen, papaja en tomaten.<br/><br/>Terwijl we pleiten voor het krijgen van zo veel van uw voedingsstoffen en antioxidanten als je kunt uit voedsel in plaats van suppletie; een studie toonde aan dat astaxanthine gecombineerd met collageenhydrolysaat aanzienlijk verbeterde barrière integriteit, verminderde transepidermale waterverlies, en verhoogde de expressie van procollageen type I mRNA.<br/><br/>Topische toepassing is de sleutel tot een gezonde huid. Studies tonen aan dat hoge concentraties antioxidanten in de menselijke huid de beste bescherming bieden voor een gezonde huid op elke leeftijd.<br/><br/>Bij Sarka Botanicals mengen we carotenoïde-rijke, hele planten zoals calendula, paardenbloem en extracten zoals astaxanthine met koudgeperste oliën en functionele ingrediënten. Calendula alleen al bevat meer dan 19 verschillende soorten carotenoïden. Dit kan verklaren waarom het zo'n lange geschiedenis van gebruik in huidverzorging heeft. Studies tonen aan dat carotenoïden gemengd met co-enzym Q10 bijzonder effectief zijn bij het verminderen van ontstekingen en het vertragen van vroegtijdige huidveroudering als gevolg van blootstelling aan de zon. |
