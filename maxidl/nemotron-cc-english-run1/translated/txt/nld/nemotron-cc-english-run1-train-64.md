| Smith Chuck - Through the Bible C2000 SeriesShall we turn to the book of Acts, chapter one, as we begin our study of the early church.<br/>Luke, the author of the book of Acts, a companion of Paul the apostle, who was author also of the Gospel According to Luke, wrote these two treatises to a friend, Theophilus. Theophilus is a Greek name. It's a name that has a beautiful meaning. The name means lover of God. There are some who believe that it was not a man at all, but that the gospel and the book of Acts were addressed to the lovers of God, whoever you may be. There are other traditions that say that Theophilus was actually Luke's master. That in those days physicians were slaves, usually the slave of a wealthy patron. So that Luke's master was Theophilus, and he released Luke to be with Paul on the missionary journeys. Thus, Luke is writing back to his former master. This is an early tradition of the church, but it is, of course, impossible to prove, like so many of the traditions.<br/>There are also those who believe that when Paul was in Troas and he received a vision of a man calling unto him saying, "Come over to Macedonia and help us," that that man in Paul's vision was none other than Luke. For the first one that Paul really met when he came to Macedonia was Luke. And as we are in the book of Acts, you will find that when we get to that portion of the book of Acts, Luke begins to write more in the first person rather than the third person. So it is, evidently, at this particular point in the Acts of the Apostles that Luke became a companion of Paul and began to journey with him. He began to use the pronouns "we" and "us" instead of "they" and "them." This is, no doubt, where Luke became a participant and an eyewitness of those things that were happening from this point on. We will bring this out to you when we get to that point.<br/>He begins the Acts of the Apostles by tying it with the Gospel According to Luke. It is interesting that the very last thing that Luke records in his gospel is the very first thing he records in the Acts of the Apostles. We find the gospel of Luke closing as Jesus is telling His disciples to wait in Jerusalem until they be endued with power from on high. And then Jesus ascended up into heaven, and so he closes the gospel. In opening the Acts of the Apostles, he writes,<br/>The former treatise [that is, the Gospel According to Luke,] have I written unto you, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and teach ( Act 1:1 ),<br/>The key word is began. The Gospel According to Luke is not the full story of the ministry of Jesus Christ. It is only the beginning of the ministry of Jesus Christ. Jesus continues to minister to the needs of people. Jesus continues to heal the sick. Jesus continues to raise the dead. Jesus continues to minister His love and His gospel to the world, only now He is ministering through those disciples who have been anointed with His Holy Spirit. But the ministry of Christ is continuing; basically, is the premise that Luke takes in the Acts of the Apostles. The former treatise of all that Jesus began, both to do and to teach.<br/>Now because of that, the Acts of the Apostles is an unfinished book: in that the Lord today continues to work through the lives of those who have dedicated themselves to be the instruments of God. To be led and guided and anointed by His Holy Spirit, to continue the ministry of Jesus in the world today. Now God has ordained that His work should be accomplished through human instruments. I do not say that it must be accomplished. God can use angelic beings for His work, and there will come a time, during the book of Revelation when God will use angels to proclaim His gospel to people all over the world. Revelation, chapter 14, "The first angel flying through the midst of heaven having the everlasting gospel" ( Rev 14:6 ). But at the present time, God has chosen to use human instruments. As imperfect as they may be, yet that's what God has ordained to use. The exciting thing about that is, God will use me and God will use you. So many times, we're begging off, "O Lord, I can't speak. I've never been able to speak before or even now, Lord." As Moses tried to beg off the call of God. Jeremiah said, "Lord, I'm just a kid; no one's going to listen to me." And we all have our excuses why we can't be used. Don't we? We all know the reasons why God couldn't use us.<br/>One time, as the Lord was calling a prophet to do His work, he said, "Lord, send whoever you want." The Lord said, "Hey, I've called you." "Lord, good idea; send whoever you want." So often we're in that position, "Lord, send by the hand of whomsoever you will, anybody but me Lord." And yet, God has ordained to use us.<br/>Now, each of us can show our own imperfections. Each of us can point out our own inabilities, and all of us can find an excuse why God wouldn't want to use me. But yet, God has chosen to use you. That through your life He might reveal Himself to a needy world. You wonder when God has such instruments to use how He ever got the job done, don't you?<br/>Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments to the apostles whom he had chosen ( Act 1:2 ):<br/>That is what he ended the Gospel of Luke with. The day that Jesus was taken up, after He had told the apostles to wait for the endowment of power.<br/>To whom he also [that is the apostles he also] showed himself alive to them after his passion [or death] by many infallible proofs ( Act 1:3 ),<br/>It is difficult to deny the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. I was amused, as well as annoyed and irritated, by an article I read in the Santa Ana Register this last Saturday. Of the creation science and evolutionary theories being presented in the county schools. How that, this one professor said that he teaches a science class, and thus, they deal only in facts, and that they don't have any place for theories. Because science is based upon fact and creation is based upon religious superstitions. It takes a lot of faith to believe the religious theories. When you are dealing with facts, you can just accept them. I thought, "Very interesting in that science class, they taught me it was a fact that the world was four billion years old. Now today they are teaching it's a fact that the world is twelve billion years old. And it wasn't that long ago that I went to school."<br/>It's interesting that the Bible has never needed to be revised or updated to meet the current data that men have discovered. And yet, if you would take my high school science textbooks today and try to teach a science class from them, you would find that many of the things that were taught as scientific fact when I was in high school are no longer recognized as scientific fact. The simple cell protoplasm is no longer a simple cell, but extremely complex. If there is any fact that can be attested to in history it is the fact of the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.<br/>We have a jurisprudence system that is based upon the testimony of witnesses. If a man is accused of a crime and there are people who witnessed that crime while it was being committed, and they are brought to the standard, and they swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help them God. And in their questioning they affirm that, "I saw that man in the bank on May twenty-third. I saw him pull out a gun from his coat. I heard him demand that all of the money be given to him. I saw him as he left the bank. I saw him as the officer apprehended him outside." And if you can get three or four witnesses to point to that man and will keep their testimony under cross-examination, that man is judged to be guilty. He is the one who did it. We have two or three witnesses that are testifying the same story about that man, and it is accepted as fact that he is the one who perpetrated the crime and is guilty. You've got witnesses who have sworn to tell the truth that are verifying.<br/>After the death of Jesus, when He rose again, He appeared unto many different people who gave sworn testimony that they saw Him. That they talked to Him, that He appeared to them in various places under different circumstances. And for a period of forty days was visiting with them. And at one time, up to as many as five hundred people who were gathered at one place, He appeared. It's difficult to just cast aside or deny the witness of these people. To do so is to discredit our whole jurisprudence system. But not only that, these men who testified that they saw the risen Lord, that they talked to Him, that they ate with Him, they, all of them, with the exception of one, met violent deaths at the hands of other people because of their affirming that the story they told was true. You talk about witnesses sworn to tell the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth. If a person's life was threatened because of that witness, and it was a lie, at least one them would've broken under the pressure. They would've confessed to the entire hoax. "He showed Himself alive after His passion by many infallible proofs."<br/>being seen of them for forty days, speaking to them of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God ( Act 1:3 ):<br/>Sometimes we fault the disciples because of their questions of the timing of the kingdom of God. Let it be remembered that the kingdom of God was the favorite subject of Jesus Christ. He was always talking about the kingdom of God, and it is a great hope that He was planting into the hearts of all men. Things are not always going to continue corrupted as they are. The world is not going to go forever under the power of darkness, under the bondage of evil. God is going to one day establish His kingdom upon the earth. A kingdom of righteous joy and peace. "Jesus shall reign, where ere the sun doth her successive journeys run. And His kingdom will extend from shore to shore." And that day will be the most glorious day the world has ever seen, as sickness and suffering and pain will be abolished in His kingdom. As sin and greed and these things that have made the world such an intolerable place will be abolished in His kingdom. The godless commercialism, the exploitation of man, all of these things abolished in His glorious kingdom when He reigns. No wonder the disciples were anxious to get it on. I'm anxious to get it on; I'm anxious for His kingdom to come. And Jesus told us when we pray, the first petition is, "Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done in earth, as it is in heaven" ( Mat 6:10 ). This is the right kind of a desire that we should all have. I desire the kingdom of God. And so He was talking to them, during this forty-day period, of the kingdom.<br/>And, being assembled together with them, he commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, saith he, you have heard of me ( Act 1:4 ).<br/>He said, "Now look, wait here in Jerusalem until you receive the promise of the Father." This promise that He is referring to is, no doubt, the promise in Joel where the Lord promised, "And it shall come to pass in the later days, saith the Lord, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all flesh; and your sons and daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall dream dreams, your old men shall see visions: and upon my servants and my handmaidens shall I pour out my Spirit, saith the Lord" ( Joe 2:28-29 ). The promise of the Father: the day is going to come when God is going to pour out His Spirit upon all flesh, all of the believers. They will, each one, receive that dynamic from God.<br/>For John [He said,] truly baptized with water; but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now ( Act 1:5 ).<br/>The idea of baptism was that of emersion, the bapteedzo. John baptized with water, submerged the people in water, "you're going to be submerged in the Holy Spirit in not many days."<br/>Now when they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ( Act 1:6 )<br/>"When is it going to be, Lord? When's the time for this restoration?" And Jesus is talking to them now, not about the kingdom, but about the power that they're going to receive for service. And so He brushes aside their question.<br/>Saying unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father has put in his own power ( Act 1:7 ).<br/>"It's not for you to know." They lived constantly in the anticipation of the immediate setting up of the kingdom. During the entire lifetime of Jesus, they were expecting Him at any moment to go into the phone booth and come out as the savior of the world. Shazzam! Showing His power and overthrowing the governments of the world, establishing God's kingdom upon the earth. And they were waiting daily for this change to transpire. And whenever Jesus would talk about going to Jerusalem, being turned over into the hands of sinful man, and then being crucified, "Oh, oh no, Lord. No, no you don't understand the kingdom, Lord. Be that far from Thee." When Jesus died on the cross, they were all greatly disappointed.<br/>The two disciples on the road to Emmaus, so sad. "Hey, fellows. How come you're so sad as your walking along?" "What do you mean? You must be a stranger around here if you don't know the things that have been happening lately in Jerusalem." "What things?" "Oh, a fellow by the name of Jesus of Nazareth...oh man, it was mighty and powerful. The anointing of God was upon His life. We had hoped that in Him was the deliverance of Israel, but they crucified Him. We had hoped . . . now it's dead." Now He's risen, and He's saying, "In a few days, fellows, you're going to receive the promise of the Father." "Oh, what promise? The promise of the establishing of the kingdom?" You see, it was legitimate that they should ask. "Is this it Lord? Alright! Is this the time? Are you going to set up your kingdom now?" "No. It's not for you to know those times that the Father's appointed or that the Father has in His own power. But, you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you."<br/>Now here, the Greek preposition epi is used to signify a new relationship that they were to have with the Holy Spirit. In the Gospel According to John, chapter 14, as Jesus is there promising to send the Holy Spirit, He said, "I will not leave you comfortless. I will come to you, and I will pray the Father, and He will send to you another comforter, even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth Him not neither knows Him, but you know Him for He dwells with you, and He shall be in you" ( Joh 14:17-18 ). Same Greek preposition as ours, only they spell it "en" instead of "in." Two-fold relationship there in John: He is with you, but He's going to be dwelling in you. But now Jesus said you're going to receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you. The Greek preposition epi, which is translated in different texts throughout the New Testament as "upon" or "over" or I like it, "overflows."<br/>In the seventh chapter of the gospel of John: "On the last day, the great day of the feast when Jesus stood there on the Temple Mount and cried to the people, 'If any man thirst let him come unto Me and drink: and he who drinks of the water that I give, out of his innermost being there will gush torrents of living water.'" John said, "This spake He of the Spirit, which was not yet given which they who believe on Him should receive" ( Joh 7:37-39 ). What did He speak of the Spirit? That it would be like a torrent of living water flowing out. I like, "When the Spirit overflows you," upon you, or over you, or overflows from you. So the three-fold relationship: He is with you prior to your conversion, He is the one who causes you to realize that you are a sinner, He is the one who points to Jesus Christ as the answer as He convinces the world of sin, of righteous, and of judgment. The moment you open your life and heart to Jesus Christ and invite Him to come in, the Holy Spirit comes and begins to indwell you. He shall be in you. "Know ye not that you are not your own, you have been bought with a price, therefore glorify God in your body and your spirit which are His. And know ye not that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit which is in you? Be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess, but be filled, or be ye being filled with the Spirit" ( 1Co 6:19-20 ,Eph 5:18 ). But now here's a third relationship. This is an empowering experience.<br/>You will receive [the dunamus] the dynamics, when the Holy Spirit has come [epi] upon you [or over you, or when there is that overflow from you]: and ye shall be witnesses unto me ( Act 1:8 )<br/>And so the dynamic, to be a witness for Jesus Christ. It is interesting that the word witness in Greek is the word martus from where we get our word martyr. And in Greek it does mean martyr. A witness is one who not only proclaims what he believes, he lives what he believes, he is what he believes, and he believes it so strongly, that if necessary, he'll die for what he believes. That's how strong is his belief. He's a martus. You can't stop him. He's not afraid to die for what he believes.<br/>You remember when Paul was on his way back to Jerusalem and Agabus came down from Caesarea and he took Paul's girdle and tied himself up and he said, "So is the man who owns this girdle to be bound when he gets to Jerusalem." And Paul's friends began to weep, saying, "Oh, Paul, don't go, don't go." And he said, "What do you mean by these tears? Do you think you're going to dissuade me? Do you think I'm worried about being bound? I'm ready to die." He was a martus. "I'm ready to die." Being put to death for your faith did not make you a martyr; because you were a martyr, you were put to death. Because you were a witness, because you believed it so strong. So, it did not make you a witness, it only proved what you were. You were a witness all along. If you hadn't been a martus, you would've never gone to your death. You would've recanted; you would've said, "Whoa, whoa, wait, wait. Hold on, let's change course here. I think that I may have made a mistake." Then you say, "Well, he wasn't a martus. Stealing a horse doesn't make you a horse thief; it only proves that you were. No one steals a horse unless he's a horse thief. So, stealing it doesn't make you a horse thief, it only proves that you were all along. Being martyred only proves what you were a witness, a martus. "And you will be witnesses." And isn't it interesting that most of them were martyred? "Witnesses unto Me."<br/>The witness was to be both in Jerusalem, and in all of Judea ( Act 1:8 ),<br/>The witness began right at home. The hardest place, isn't it? It's to start right at home in Jerusalem, and then the area around Jerusalem, the area of Judea. And then it was to spread up into Samaria. And then it was to go out into the uttermost parts of the world. And as we study the book of Acts, we will see this very progression. How the witness began in Jerusalem. We'll get that in the next chapter. And then we'll see how it began to spread through out Judea. And then Phillip went up into Samaria, and then finally Paul and Barnabas are called to go into the uttermost parts of the world. And so the witness spread through the anointing and the empowering of the Holy Spirit.<br/>Now when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight ( Act 1:9 ).<br/>This is the final promise made by Jesus to His disciples. This is it, the final words prior to His ascension. Of course, later He came and talked to Paul and others, but prior to His ascension, this is His final word. And upon this, when He had spoken these things, while they were watching Him, He was taken up and a cloud received Him out of their sight.<br/>And while they were looking steadfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, there were two men who stood by them in white apparel ( Act 1:10 );<br/>We assume they were angels.<br/>Which also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you have seen him go into heaven ( Act 1:11 ).<br/>They saw Him as He ascended up into heaven and they will behold Him when He comes again. "Behold the Lord cometh with ten thousands of His saints, to execute judgement upon the earth" (Jud 1:14-15). And then, "Unto Him who loved us and gave Himself for us and who has made us unto our God, kings and priests who shall reign with Him upon the earth, behold the Lord cometh, and every eye shall see Him, and they also who pierced Him shall mourn" Rev 1:5-7 ). So the Lord's coming. Every eye shall see Him. The Jehovah Witnesses say that He is already come, but it was a secret coming. As it was only the disciples that saw Him go, it was only the disciples, of the Jehovah Witnesses, who saw Him return. But Jesus said, "If they say unto you, 'He has come in secret and has gone into a secret chamber don't believe it'" ( Mat 24:26 ). So you have to choose, to believe Jesus or them.<br/>"This same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as you've seen Him go into heaven."<br/>Now there's a very interesting verse in II John, verse Act 1:7 , "For many deceivers are entered into the world who confess not that Jesus Christ is come in the flesh." That, unfortunately, is a poor translation of the Greek. For this participle is in the present tense and should be translated "is coming in the flesh." Those who would deny that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh. What does John say of them? "They are a deceiver and an antichrist. Look to yourselves, that we lose not those things which we have wrought, but that we receive a full reward. For whosoever transgresses and abides not in the doctrine of Christ, has not God. He that abides in the doctrine of Christ, he has both the Father and the Son. And if there come any unto your door (on Saturday morning) and bring not this doctrine, receive him not into your house, and neither bid him good-bye. For he that bids him good-bye is a partaker of his evil deeds" (2Jn 1:7-11). Ask them one question, "Is Jesus coming in the flesh?" Just ask them that question. And if they say no, just remember what John warned you and what John told you. "If any confess not that Jesus Christ is coming in the flesh." Do you remember when He was with the disciples and He said, "Give me something to eat"? He said, "You know, spirits don't eat; touch me. See? It's me." So, this same Jesus is coming again in the same manner in which they saw Him go into heaven. And I, for one, believe that that coming is very soon.<br/>Then retuned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a Sabbath's day journey [about two-thirds of a mile]. And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where there abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, and Phillip, and Thomas, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus, and Simon Zelotes, and Judas the brother of James. And these all continued in one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brothers ( Act 1:12-14 ).<br/>This is the last mention of Mary the mother of Jesus. At this point and from this point on, there is no further mention of her in the Acts of the Apostles or in the epistles. No mention of her death or of her miraculous ascension into heaven, without death. Nothing is mentioned in the scripture. It is silent.<br/>His brethren would be a reference probably to James and to Jude and to those other brothers who were sons of Joseph and Mary.<br/>The upper room--there are some who say that it is the same upper room in which Jesus had the Last Supper with His disciples. And yet, there are others who hold to this upper room being a room in the temple precincts where the early church met. Take your choice.<br/>And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of their names together were about one hundred and twenty,) men and brethren, this Scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, which was a guide to those who took Jesus ( Act 1:15-16 ).<br/>Here again, Peter still his same impetuous self. They're waiting in prayer and supplication, and Peter stands up and says, "Fellows, there's a scripture that's gotta be fulfilled." And you know he's going to move ahead, "Let's get the program going; let's cast lots and find out who's going to take Judas' place." I do feel that Peter was again in the flesh, manifesting that impetuous nature that was his. And I think that the future history of the church in the book of Acts points this out. I am interested in Peter's understanding of the scriptures, how that he is quoting from so many places in the Old Testament. Peter does manifest a very great understanding of the Old Testament scriptures which is a point in his favor.<br/>Notice that Peter ascribes to the Holy Spirit those things that David wrote. So that, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Not part of the scriptures. Because, if you tell me that part of the scriptures are given by inspiration of God, then I must ask you, "What parts are by inspiration and what parts are not by inspiration?" And then you are then the authority who tells me what part I can believe and what part I can't believe. And the minute that God is no longer the authority but you're the authority, I'm in trouble. Beware of those who say, "Well, you can't believe all of the scriptures." The scriptures themselves say, "All scripture is given by inspiration of God." And here, Luke in writing of what Peter was saying, declares that David was actually the spokesman for the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit, by the mouth of David, spake concerning Judas.<br/>For he was numbered with us, [he was one of the twelve] he had obtained a part of this ministry. But now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong ( Act 1:17-18 ),<br/>He purchased the field, the potter's field as Zachariah the eleventh chapter declares.<br/>and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all of his bowels gushed out ( Act 1:18 ).<br/>There are those who find a discrepancy in the scriptures, because in one of the gospels we are told that when Judas came back and tried to return the money, and they said, "Hey, it's your problem. We can't take it." And put it back in the temple treasury. "It's blood money." Then he threw it there on the floor of the temple and he went out and hung himself. Here Peter tells us that he fell headlong and just popped. And there are those who imagine a discrepancy. Very simple, he went up into the tree to hang himself, tied the rope around his neck and tied it to the limb and jumped. And the force of the fall either snapped the rope or his head, and he fell on down into the canyon and just as he said it here.<br/>It was known to all of the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch that the field is called in their tongue, Aceldama, that is to say, The field of blood. For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishoprick let another take ( Act 1:19-20 ).<br/>Now in reality he's quoting from two different Psalms here. From Psa 69:25 ,he puts it together with Psa 109:8 . And putting the two together he finds these prophecies concerning Judas.<br/>Wherefore of these men ( Act 1:21 )<br/>Now here is where they are looking for someone to take Judas' place to be an apostle. Here are the qualifications they looked for in that time.<br/>Wherefore of these men which have companied with us all the time that the Lord Jesus when in and out among us ( Act 1:21 ),<br/>Now you remember there were many disciples, many disciples of which Jesus chose ten to be apostles. And the word apostle means "one who is sent out." Or chose twelve to be apostles, so He sent out the twelve. The number of human government. "We only have eleven. We need one to take Judas' place, but we need one who has been with us all the while from the beginning with Jesus."<br/>From the time he was baptized by John, until the day he was taken up from us, must one be ordained to be a witness [of what?] of His resurrection ( Act 1:22 ).<br/>So these were the requirements they were looking for. Someone who had been around the whole while. From the time of John's baptism to the ascension. And one who saw the risen Lord, and thus could bear fact of the resurrection, their testimony to the fact.<br/>Now Paul the apostle, later in asserting the fact that he was an apostle said, "Have I not seen the risen Christ?" Evidently that was one of the requirements of apostleship. Someone asked me, "Are there apostles today?" Well, I don't know. I don't think that there are in the same sense that they were in the New Testament. Surely there is none today who can bear witness to the resurrection as they did.<br/>They appointed two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias. And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, which knowest the hearts of all men, show whether of these two that you have chosen ( Act 1:23-24 ),<br/>I think that we often make this mistake of giving the Lord two choices, both wrong. Limiting God, you see. We're so prone to do this. Obviously, Paul was God's choice. Peter was impetuous, and jumping the gun said, "Hey, we've got to do something, you know, gotta help God out. You know, one's missing and we've got to fill him in." And yet, "God, which one of these two do you want?" And giving God the two choices.<br/>That he may take part of this ministry and this apostleship, from which Judas by the transgression fell, that he might go to his own place. And so they gave forth their lots ( Act 1:25-26 );<br/>An interesting way by which they sought to determine the will of God. Let's throw dice, find out what God's will is here. It's interesting to me, the various ways that people have devised to discern the will of God. Now, in the Old Testament times they had an interesting way of coming to the priest, who would inquire of the Lord for them through the Urim and the Thummim, the "lights and perfections." Just what these Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. I'm sure they were not the colored glasses that Joseph Smith found with the Golden Tablets; the magic glasses, that when you put them on, you could suddenly read the hieroglyphic writing.<br/>There are those who say that the Urim and Thummim were actually a black and a white stone that was worn in a pouch on the chest of the priest. They would pray and ask the Lord a particular question. You remember that David was asking the Lord definite questions: "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "No." So again, the next day, "Lord, shall we go out against the Philistines?" The answer was, "Yes." "When shall we go?" They would ask specific questions, and the Lord would direct them through the Urim and the Thummin. They say that the priest would pray, seek God, and then reach in and pull out one of the two stones. If it was the white stone, it was a yes answer. If it was a no, then it would be the black stone that he would pull out. Some even say we get the term blackballed from this Urim and Thummim. Actually, back in the original it is a no vote against a particular project or idea. Just what the Urim and Thummim were, we don't know. But during the Old Testament period, they did use a method of casting lots to determine the will of God.<br/>So here the disciples are picking up on the same thing as they are throwing the dice to see which of the two fellows that God had chosen to replace Judas Iscariot.<br/>the lot fell on Matthias; he was numbered with the eleven ( Act 1:26 ).<br/>Now who in the world is Matthias? No one ever heard of him before or since. It'll be interesting to meet Matthias and find out who he is and what he did. I think from the subsequent history, it's obvious to assume that God chose Paul as an apostle. Paul declares it himself. Now this is the last time we ever read of them seeking to discern the will of God by the casting of lots or by a chance kind of a thing.<br/>I know a fellow today, in seeking to discern the will of the Lord, will pray and ask the Lord a question. He'll have ten pennies in his pocket, and as he's praying, he'll take the pennies with his eyes closed and put them down on the table, and if they all come up heads, it's a yes. An interesting thing, every once in a while, they'll all come up heads, and that's pretty good odds. Yet, we don't find any pattern for this after the Holy Spirit was given. Once the Holy Spirit came upon the church, then the Holy Spirit began to speak to them and direct them. And the Holy Spirit said, "Separate unto me Paul and Barnabas for the ministry where I have called them" ( Act 13:2 ). And the Holy Spirit sent them forth. So we find the church more directly guided by the Holy Spirit. Once the Holy Spirit came, this throwing dice to find out the will of God was set aside.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James Version<br/><br/>This is the 1769 King James Version of the Holy Bible (also known as the Authorized Version). "Public Domain" | Smith Chuck - Door de Bijbelse C2000-serie zullen we ons wenden tot het boek Handelingen, hoofdstuk 1, terwijl we onze studie van de vroege kerk beginnen.<br/>Lukas, de auteur van het boek Handelingen, een metgezel van Paulus de apostel, die ook auteur was van het Evangelie Volgens Lukas, schreef deze twee verhandelingen aan een vriend, Theophilus. Theophilus is een Griekse naam. Het is een naam die een mooie betekenis heeft. De naam betekent liefhebber van God. Er zijn sommigen die geloven dat het helemaal geen mens was, maar dat het evangelie en het boek Handelingen waren gericht tot de liefhebbers van God, wie je ook bent. Er zijn andere tradities die zeggen dat Theophilus eigenlijk de meester van Lukas was. Dat in die dagen artsen slaven waren, meestal de slaaf van een rijke beschermheer. Lukas’ meester was dus Theophilus, en hij liet Lukas vrij om bij Paulus te zijn op de zendingsreizen. Zo schrijft Lukas terug aan zijn voormalige meester. Dit is een vroege traditie van de kerk, maar het is natuurlijk onmogelijk om te bewijzen, zoals zoveel van de tradities.<br/>Er zijn ook mensen die geloven dat toen Paulus in Troas was en hij een visioen ontving van een man die tot hem riep en zei: "Kom naar Macedonië en help ons," dat die man in het visioen van Paulus niemand anders was dan Lukas. Voor de eerste die Paulus werkelijk ontmoette toen hij in Macedonië kwam, was Lukas. En zoals wij in het boek Handelingen staan, zult u vinden dat wanneer we bij dat deel van het boek Handelingen komen, Lukas meer begint te schrijven in de eerste persoon dan in de derde persoon. Zo is het klaarblijkelijk op dit specifieke punt in de Handelingen van de Apostelen dat Lukas een metgezel van Paulus werd en met hem begon te reizen. Hij begon de voornaamwoorden "wij" en "ons" te gebruiken in plaats van "zij" en "zij". Dit is ongetwijfeld waar Luke een deelnemer werd en een ooggetuige van die dingen die vanaf dit punt gebeurden. We zullen dit aan u uitbrengen als we tot dat punt komen.<br/>Hij begint de Handelingen van de Apostelen door het te verbinden met het Evangelie volgens Lukas. Het is interessant dat het allerlaatste wat Lukas in zijn evangelie optekent, het allereerste is wat hij in de Handelingen van de Apostelen optekent. We vinden het evangelie van Lukas sluiten als Jezus vertelt Zijn discipelen om te wachten in Jeruzalem totdat ze worden bekleed met kracht uit de hemel. En toen Jezus opgestegen naar de hemel, en dus sluit hij het evangelie. In het openen van de Handelingen van de Apostelen, schrijft hij,<br/>Het eerste verhandeling heb ik u geschreven, o Theofilus, over alles wat Jezus begon te doen en te onderwijzen (Handelingen 1:1),<br/>Het sleutelwoord is begonnen. Het Evangelie Volgens Lukas is niet het volledige verhaal van de bediening van Jezus Christus. Het is slechts het begin van de bediening van Jezus Christus. Jezus blijft de behoeften van de mensen dienen. Jezus blijft de zieken genezen. Jezus blijft de doden opwekken. Jezus blijft Zijn liefde en Zijn evangelie aan de wereld dienen, alleen nu dient Hij door middel van die discipelen die gezalfd zijn met Zijn Heilige Geest. Maar de bediening van Christus gaat door; in principe is dat het uitgangspunt dat Lukas neemt in de Handelingen van de Apostelen. De vroegere verhandeling van alles wat Jezus begon, zowel te doen als te onderwijzen.<br/>Daarom is de Handelingen van de Apostelen een onvoltooid boek: omdat de Heer vandaag door het leven van hen die zich hebben opgedragen om de werktuigen van God te zijn, blijft werken. Om geleid en geleid en gezalfd te worden door Zijn Heilige Geest, om de bediening van Jezus in de wereld van vandaag voort te zetten. Nu heeft God verordend dat Zijn werk door menselijke instrumenten moet worden volbracht. Ik zeg niet dat het moet worden volbracht. God kan engelen gebruiken voor Zijn werk, en er zal een tijd komen, tijdens het boek Openbaring, wanneer God engelen zal gebruiken om Zijn evangelie aan mensen over de hele wereld te verkondigen. Openbaring, hoofdstuk 14, "De eerste engel die door het midden van de hemel vloog met het eeuwige evangelie" (Openb 14:6). Maar op dit moment heeft God ervoor gekozen om menselijke instrumenten te gebruiken. Hoe onvolmaakt ze ook mogen zijn, maar dat is wat God heeft verordineerd om te gebruiken. Het opwindende aan dat is, God zal mij gebruiken en God zal u gebruiken. Zo vaak smeken we af, "O Heer, ik kan niet spreken. Ik heb nog nooit eerder of zelfs nu kunnen spreken, Heer." Zoals Mozes probeerde de roep van God af te smeken. Jeremia zei: "Heer, ik ben maar een kind; niemand zal naar mij luisteren." En we hebben allemaal onze excuses waarom we niet kunnen worden gebruikt. Toch? We weten allemaal de redenen waarom God ons niet kan gebruiken.<br/>Op een keer, toen de Heer een profeet riep om Zijn werk te doen, zei hij: "Heer, zend wie u wilt." De Heer zei: "Heer, ik heb u geroepen." "Heer, goed idee; stuur wie u wilt." Zo dikwijls zijn wij in die positie: "Heer, zend door de hand van wie Gij wilt, iedereen behalve mij, Heer." En toch heeft God ons verordineerd om ons te gebruiken.<br/>Nu, ieder van ons kan zijn eigen onvolmaaktheden tonen. Ieder van ons kan op onze eigen onvermogen wijzen, en ieder van ons kan een excuus vinden waarom God mij niet zou willen gebruiken. Maar toch, God heeft ervoor gekozen om jou te gebruiken. Dat Hij Zich door je leven aan een behoeftige wereld zou kunnen openbaren. Je vraagt je af wanneer God zulke instrumenten heeft om te gebruiken hoe Hij ooit het werk gedaan heeft, nietwaar?<br/>Tot op de dag dat hij werd opgenomen, nadat hij door de Heilige Geest geboden had gegeven aan de apostelen die hij had uitverkoren (Handelingen 1:2):<br/>Daarmee eindigde hij het Evangelie van Lukas, de dag dat Jezus werd opgenomen, nadat Hij de apostelen had gezegd te wachten op de gave van macht.<br/>Aan wie Hij Zich ook levend heeft getoond na Zijn lijden door vele onfeilbare bewijzen (Hand.1:3).<br/>Het is moeilijk om het feit van de opstanding van Jezus Christus te ontkennen. Ik was geamuseerd, evenals geïrriteerd en geïrriteerd, door een artikel dat ik las in het Santa Ana Register afgelopen zaterdag. Van de scheppingswetenschap en evolutionaire theorieën die in de scholen van de provincie worden gepresenteerd. Hoe dat, deze professor zei dat hij een wetenschapsklasse onderwijst, en dus behandelen ze alleen in feiten, en dat ze geen plaats hebben voor theorieën. Omdat de wetenschap gebaseerd is op feiten en de schepping gebaseerd is op religieus bijgeloof. Het vergt veel geloof om de religieuze theorieën te geloven. Wanneer je het met feiten hebt, kun je ze gewoon accepteren. Ik dacht: "Zeer interessant in die wetenschapsles, ze leerden me dat het een feit was dat de wereld vier miljard jaar oud was. Nu leren ze dat het een feit is dat de wereld twaalf miljard jaar oud is. En het was nog niet zo lang geleden dat ik naar school ging.”<br/>Het is interessant dat de Bijbel nooit hoefde te worden herzien of bijgewerkt om te voldoen aan de huidige gegevens die mensen hebben ontdekt. En toch, als je vandaag mijn wetenschappelijke studieboeken van de middelbare school zou nemen en er een wetenschapsklasse van zou proberen te onderwijzen, zou je merken dat veel van de dingen die werden onderwezen als wetenschappelijk feit toen ik op de middelbare school zat, niet langer worden erkend als wetenschappelijk feit. Het eenvoudige celprotoplasma is niet langer een eenvoudige cel, maar uiterst complex. Als er een feit is dat in de geschiedenis kan worden bevestigd, is het het feit van de opstanding van Jezus Christus uit de dood.<br/>We hebben een jurisprudentiesysteem dat is gebaseerd op getuigenissen van getuigen. Als een man wordt beschuldigd van een misdaad en er zijn mensen die getuige zijn van die misdaad terwijl deze werd gepleegd, en ze worden naar de standaard gebracht, en ze zweren om de waarheid te vertellen, de hele waarheid, en niets dan de waarheid, help hen dan God. En in hun ondervraging bevestigen ze: "Ik zag die man op de bank op mei eenentwintigste. Ik zag hem een pistool uit zijn jas trekken. Ik hoorde hem eisen dat al het geld aan hem wordt gegeven. Ik zag hem terwijl hij de bank verliet. Ik zag dat de officier hem buiten arresteerde." En als je drie of vier getuigen naar die man kunt laten wijzen en hun getuigenis onder kruisverhoor houdt, wordt die man schuldig bevonden. Hij is degene die het deed. We hebben twee of drie getuigen die getuigen van hetzelfde verhaal over die man, en het wordt geaccepteerd als een feit dat hij degene is die de misdaad heeft gepleegd en schuldig is.<br/>Na de dood van Jezus, toen Hij weer opstond, verscheen Hij aan vele verschillende mensen die gezworen getuigenis gaven dat ze Hem zagen, dat ze met Hem spraken, dat Hij hen op verschillende plaatsen verscheen onder verschillende omstandigheden. En hij bezocht hen gedurende een periode van veertig dagen. En op een keer verscheen Hij, tot wel vijfhonderd mensen, die op één plaats verzameld waren. Het is moeilijk om het getuigenis van deze mensen terzijde te werpen of te ontkennen. Dat betekent dat we ons hele jurisprudentiesysteem in diskrediet brengen. Maar niet alleen dat, deze mannen die getuigden dat zij de verrezen Heer zagen, dat zij met Hem spraken, dat zij met Hem aten, zij allen, met uitzondering van één, ondervonden gewelddadige dood door de handen van andere mensen omdat zij beweerden dat het verhaal dat zij vertelden waar was. Je hebt het over getuigen die gezworen hebben de waarheid te vertellen, de hele waarheid, niets dan de waarheid. Als iemands leven bedreigd zou worden door die getuige, en het was een leugen, dan zou er tenminste één gebroken zijn onder de druk. "Hij heeft Zich na Zijn lijden levend getoond door vele onfeilbare bewijzen."<br/>Hij werd veertig dagen van hen gezien en sprak tot hen over de dingen van het Koninkrijk van God (Handelingen 1:3).<br/>Soms beschuldigen wij de discipelen van hun vragen over de timing van het koninkrijk van God. Laten we niet vergeten dat het koninkrijk van God het favoriete onderwerp van Jezus Christus was. Hij sprak altijd over het koninkrijk van God, en het is een grote hoop dat Hij in de harten van alle mensen plantte. Dingen zullen niet altijd verderfelijk blijven zoals ze zijn. De wereld zal niet eeuwig onder de macht van de duisternis komen, onder de slavernij van het kwaad. God zal op een dag Zijn koninkrijk op aarde vestigen. Een koninkrijk van rechtvaardige vreugde en vrede. "Jezus zal heersen, waar de zon haar opeenvolgende reizen doet, en Zijn koninkrijk zal zich uitstrekken van oever tot oever." En die dag zal de meest glorieuze dag zijn die de wereld ooit heeft gezien, zoals ziekte en lijden en pijn zullen worden afgeschaft in Zijn koninkrijk. Als zonde en hebzucht en deze dingen die de wereld zo'n ondraaglijke plaats hebben gemaakt, zullen worden afgeschaft in Zijn koninkrijk. Het goddeloze commercialisme, de uitbuiting van de mens, al deze dingen werden afgeschaft in Zijn glorierijke koninkrijk toen Hij regeerde. Geen wonder dat de discipelen ernaar verlangden om het te krijgen. Ik kijk ernaar uit om het te krijgen; Ik kijk ernaar uit om Zijn koninkrijk te komen. En Jezus vertelde ons wanneer we bidden, het eerste verzoek is: "Uw koninkrijk kome. Uw wil geschiede op aarde, zoals het is in de hemel" (Mattheüs 6:10 ). Dit is de juiste soort van verlangen dat we allemaal zouden moeten hebben. Ik verlang het koninkrijk van God. En zo sprak Hij tot hen, gedurende deze periode van veertig dagen, over het koninkrijk.<br/>En als Hij met hen vergaderd was, gebood Hij hun, dat zij Jeruzalem niet zouden verlaten, maar wachten op de belofte des Vaders, die, zegt Hij, gij van Mij gehoord hebt.<br/>Hij zei: "Kijk nu, wacht hier in Jeruzalem totdat u de belofte van de Vader ontvangt." Deze belofte waar Hij naar verwijst, is ongetwijfeld de belofte in Joël, waar de Heer beloofde: "En het zal geschieden in de laatste dagen, zegt de Heer, dat Ik Mijn Geest zal uitstorten op alle vlees; en uw zonen en dochters zullen profeteren, en uw jongelingen zullen dromen dromen, uw oude mannen zullen visioenen zien; en op Mijn knechten en Mijn dienstmaagden zal Ik uitstorten, zegt de Heer Joze. De belofte van de Vader: de dag zal komen dat God Zijn Geest zal uitstorten op alle gelovigen, op alle vlees. Zij zullen ieder die dynamiek van God ontvangen.<br/>Want Johannes heeft waarlijk met water gedoopt; maar gij zult met den Heiligen Geest gedoopt worden, niet vele dagen van nu af (Hand.1:5).<br/>Johannes doopte met water, doopte de mensen onder water, "Gij zult in niet vele dagen ondergedompeld worden in de Heilige Geest."<br/>En toen zij bijeenkwamen, vroegen zij Hem: Heere, wilt Gij in deze tijd het koninkrijk aan Israël wedergeven?<br/>"Wanneer zal het zijn, Heer? Wanneer is de tijd voor deze restauratie?" En Jezus spreekt nu tot hen, niet over het koninkrijk, maar over de macht die zij zullen ontvangen voor dienst. En dus schrapt Hij hun vraag opzij.<br/>En Hij zeide tot hen: Het is niet aan u om de tijden en de tijden te kennen, die de Vader in Zijn eigen macht gesteld heeft.<br/>"Het is niet aan u om het te weten." Ze leefden voortdurend in afwachting van de onmiddellijke opbouw van het koninkrijk. Gedurende het hele leven van Jezus verwachtten ze dat Hij op elk moment in de telefooncel zou gaan en als de redder van de wereld zou uitkomen. Shazzam! Zijn macht tonen en de regeringen van de wereld omverwerpen, Gods koninkrijk op aarde vestigen. En ze wachtten dagelijks op deze verandering om te gebeuren. En wanneer Jezus sprak over naar Jeruzalem gaan, overgeleverd worden in de handen van een zondaar, en dan gekruisigd worden: "O nee, Heer, nee, u begrijpt het koninkrijk niet, Heer, wees zo ver van U." Toen Jezus aan het kruis stierf, waren ze allemaal erg teleurgesteld.<br/>De twee discipelen op weg naar Emmaüs, zo verdrietig. "Hé, jongens. Hoe komt het dat je zo verdrietig bent als je meeloopt?" "Wat bedoel je? Je moet hier een vreemdeling zijn als je niet weet wat er de laatste tijd in Jeruzalem gebeurt." "Wat voor dingen?" "O, een man met de naam van Jezus van Nazareth... o man, het was machtig en krachtig. De zalving van God was op Zijn leven. We hadden gehoopt dat in Hem de verlossing van Israël was, maar ze hadden Hem gekruisigd. We hadden gehoopt . . . nu is het dood." Nu is Hij opgestaan, en Hij zegt: "Over een paar dagen, makkers, zult u de belofte van de Vader ontvangen." "O, welke belofte? De belofte van de vestiging van het koninkrijk?" U ziet, het was legitiem dat ze zouden vragen. "Is dit Heer? Goed! Is dit de tijd? Wilt u nu uw koninkrijk oprichten? "Nee, het is niet aan u om die tijden te kennen die de Vader heeft aangewezen of die de Vader in Zijn eigen kracht heeft. Maar u zult kracht ontvangen wanneer de Heilige Geest op u komt."<br/>Nu, hier wordt de Griekse voorzetsel epi gebruikt om een nieuwe relatie aan te duiden die zij met de Heilige Geest zouden hebben. In het Evangelie volgens Johannes, hoofdstuk 14, zegt Jezus, omdat Hij belooft de Heilige Geest te zenden: “Ik zal u niet zonder troost achterlaten. Ik zal tot u komen, en ik zal tot de Vader bidden, en Hij zal u een andere trooster zenden, namelijk de Geest der waarheid, die de wereld niet kan ontvangen, omdat zij Hem niet ziet, noch Hem kent, maar gij kent Hem, want Hij woont bij u, en Hij zal in u zijn. Dezelfde Griekse voorstelling als die van ons, alleen ze spellen het "en" in plaats van "in". Tweevoudige relatie daar in Johannes: Hij is met u, maar Hij zal in u wonen. Maar nu zei Jezus dat u kracht zult ontvangen wanneer de Heilige Geest over u komt. De Griekse voorzetsel epi, die in verschillende teksten in het hele Nieuwe Testament wordt vertaald als "op" of "over" of ik vind het leuk, "overloopt."<br/>In het zevende hoofdstuk van het evangelie van Johannes: "Op de laatste dag, de grote dag van het feest, toen Jezus daar op de Tempelberg stond en tot het volk riep: 'Als iemand dorst heeft, laat hem tot Mij komen en drinken; en wie drinkt van het water dat Ik geef, uit zijn binnenste zullen er stromen van levend water vloeien.'" Johannes zei: "Hij sprak van de Geest, die nog niet gegeven was, die zij die in Hem geloven zouden ontvangen" (Joh 7:37-39 ). Wat sprak Hij van de Geest? Dat het zou zijn als een stroom van levend water die uitstroomt. Ik hou van: "Wanneer de Geest u overstroomt," over u, of over u, of overstroomt van u. Dus de drievoudige relatie: Hij is met u vóór uw bekering, Hij is degene die u laat beseffen dat u een zondaar bent, Hij is degene die naar Jezus Christus wijst als het antwoord als Hij de wereld van zonde, rechtvaardigheid en oordeel overtuigt. Op het moment dat u uw leven en hart opent voor Jezus Christus en Hem uitnodigt binnen te komen, komt de Heilige Geest en begint u te bewonen. Hij zal in u zijn. Weet gij niet, dat gij niet de uwe zijt, want gij zijt met een prijs gekocht; verheerlijkt dan God in uw lichaam en uw geest, die Zijn zijn; en weet gij niet, dat uw lichaam de tempel is van den Heiligen Geest, die in u is? Wordt niet dronken van wijn, waarin overvloed is, maar wordt vervuld, of wordt vervuld met de Geest" (1Co 6:19-20; Ef 5:18). Maar nu is hier een derde relatie. Dit is een bekrachtigende ervaring.<br/>Gij zult de dynamiek ontvangen, wanneer de Heilige Geest over u gekomen zal zijn; en gij zult getuigen van Mij zijn.<br/>En zo de dynamiek, om een getuige voor Jezus Christus te zijn. Het is interessant dat het woord getuige in het Grieks het woord martus is van waaruit we ons woord martelaar krijgen. En in het Grieks betekent het martelaar. Een getuige is iemand die niet alleen verkondigt wat hij gelooft, hij leeft wat hij gelooft, hij is wat hij gelooft, en hij gelooft het zo sterk, dat hij, indien nodig, zal sterven voor wat hij gelooft. Dat is hoe sterk zijn geloof is. Hij is een martus. Je kunt hem niet tegenhouden, hij is niet bang om te sterven voor wat hij gelooft.<br/>Herinnert u zich toen Paulus op weg was naar Jeruzalem en Agabus van Caesarea afkwam en de gordel van Paulus nam en zichzelf vastbindde en zei: "Zo zal de man die deze gordel bezit, gebonden worden wanneer hij in Jeruzalem aankomt." En de vrienden van Paulus begonnen te huilen, zeggende: "O, Paulus, ga niet, ga niet." En hij zei: "Wat bedoel je met deze tranen? Denk je dat je me zult afschrikken? Denk je dat ik bang ben dat ik gebonden ben? Ik ben klaar om te sterven." Hij was een martelaar. "Ik ben klaar om te sterven." Dat je voor je geloof werd gedood, maakte je niet tot een martelaar; omdat je een martelaar was, werd je gedood. Omdat je een getuige was, omdat je het zo sterk geloofde. Dus, het maakte je geen getuige, het bewees alleen wat je was. Je was de hele tijd getuige geweest. Als je geen Martus was geweest, zou je nooit naar je dood zijn gegaan. Je zou je hebben teruggetrokken; je zou hebben gezegd: "Whoa, whoa, wacht, wacht. Wacht even, laten we hier van koers veranderen. Ik denk dat ik een fout heb gemaakt." Dan zeg je: "Wel, hij was geen martus. Het stelen van een paard maakt je niet tot een paardendief; het bewijst alleen dat je dat was. Niemand steelt een paard tenzij hij een paardendief is. Het stelen ervan maakt je dus niet tot een paardendief, het bewijst alleen dat je al die tijd bent geweest. Het martelaarschap bewijst alleen dat je een getuige was, een martelaar. "En je zult getuigen zijn." En is het niet interessant dat de meesten van hen werden gemarteld? "Getuigen van Mij."<br/>Het getuigenis moest zowel in Jeruzalem als in heel Judea zijn (Handelingen 1:8).<br/>De getuigenis begon direct thuis. De moeilijkste plaats, nietwaar? Het is om direct thuis in Jeruzalem te beginnen, en dan het gebied rond Jeruzalem, het gebied van Judea. En dan was het om zich uit te breiden naar Samaria. En dan was het om uit te gaan naar de uiterste delen van de wereld. En terwijl we het boek Handelingen bestuderen, zullen we deze vooruitgang zien. Hoe de getuigenis begon in Jeruzalem. We zullen dat in het volgende hoofdstuk krijgen. En dan zullen we zien hoe het zich begon te verspreiden door Judea, en dan Filippus ging op naar Samaria, en tenslotte Paulus en Barnabas worden geroepen om te gaan naar de uithoeken van de wereld. En zo verspreidde het getuigenis zich door de zalving en de bekrachtiging van de Heilige Geest.<br/>En als Hij deze dingen gesproken had, toen zij Hem aanschouwden, werd Hij opgeheven; en een wolk ontving Hem uit hun ogen.<br/>Dit is de laatste belofte die Jezus aan Zijn discipelen deed. Dit is de laatste woorden vóór Zijn hemelvaart. Natuurlijk kwam Hij later en sprak met Paulus en anderen, maar vóór Zijn hemelvaart is dit Zijn laatste woord. En hierop, toen Hij deze dingen gesproken had, toen zij Hem aankeken, werd Hij opgeheven en een wolk ontving Hem voor hun ogen.<br/>En terwijl zij vastberaden naar de hemel keken terwijl Hij opging, zie, er stonden twee mannen bij hen in witte klederen (Handelingen 1:10).<br/>We nemen aan dat het engelen waren.<br/>En die zeiden: Gij mannen van Galilea, waarom staat gij op te kijken naar de hemel? Deze Jezus, Die van u opgenomen is in de hemel, zal alzo komen, gelijk gij Hem hebt zien opgaan in de hemel.<br/>Zij zagen Hem opstijgen in de hemel en zij zullen Hem aanschouwen wanneer Hij wederkomt. "Zie, de Heer komt met tienduizenden van Zijn heiligen, om oordeel te voltrekken op de aarde" (Jud 1:14-15). En dan: "Aan Hem die ons liefheeft en Zichzelf voor ons heeft gegeven en die ons tot onze God heeft gemaakt, koningen en priesters die met Hem op de aarde zullen regeren, zie, de Heer komt, en ieder oog zal Hem zien, en ook zij die Hem doorstoken hebben, zullen treuren" (Openb.1:5-7). Dus de komst van de Heer. Elk oog zal Hem zien. De Jehovah's Getuigen zeggen dat Hij al gekomen is, maar het was een geheime komst. Omdat alleen de discipelen Hem zagen gaan, waren het alleen de discipelen, van de Jehovah's Getuigen, die Hem zagen terugkeren. Maar Jezus zeide: Indien zij tot u zeggen: Hij is in het verborgene gekomen, en is in een verborgene kamer gegaan, gelooft het niet.<br/>"Dezezelfde Jezus, die van u naar de hemel is opgenomen, zal op dezelfde wijze komen als gij Hem naar de hemel hebt zien gaan."<br/>Nu is er een zeer interessant vers in 2 Johannes, vers Handelingen 1:7, "Want vele verleiders zijn in de wereld gekomen, die niet belijden dat Jezus Christus in het vlees is gekomen." Dat is helaas een slechte vertaling van het Grieks. Want dit deelwoord is in de tegenwoordige tijd en moet worden vertaald "komt in het vlees." Zij die zouden ontkennen dat Jezus Christus in het vlees komt. Wat zegt Johannes over hen? "Zij zijn een verleider en een antichrist. Ziet toe, dat wij niet verliezen, wat wij gedaan hebben, maar dat wij een volkomen loon ontvangen; want zo wie overtreedt, en niet blijft in de leer van Christus, heeft God niet. Wie in de leer van Christus blijft, die heeft zowel de Vader als de Zoon; en indien er iemand tot uw deur komt (op zaterdagmorgen) en deze leer niet brengt, ontvangt hem niet in uw huis, en neemt hem niet afscheid. Want wie afscheid van hem neemt, is een deelgenoot van zijn slechte daden" (2 Joh 1:7-11). Vraag hen één vraag: "Komt Jezus in het vlees?" Vraag hen alleen die vraag. En als ze nee zeggen, onthoud dan wat Johannes u heeft gewaarschuwd en wat Johannes u heeft gezegd. "Als iemand niet belijdt dat Jezus Christus in het vlees komt." Herinnert u zich toen Hij bij de discipelen was en zei: "Geef mij iets te eten?" Hij zei: "Weet u, geesten eten niet; raak mij aan. Ziet u? Ik ben het." Dus deze zelfde Jezus komt weer op dezelfde manier waarop zij Hem naar de hemel zagen gaan. En ik geloof voor één dat die komst zeer spoedig is.<br/>Toen keerden zij naar Jeruzalem terug van de Olijfberg, die van Jeruzalem een sabbatsreis is. En toen zij binnenkwamen, gingen zij naar een bovenverdieping, waar Petrus, en Jakobus, en Johannes, en Andreas, en Filippus, en Thomas, en Bartholomeüs, en Matteüs, en Jakobus, den zoon van Alfaeus, en Simon, de Zelote, en Judas, den broeder van Jakobus. En dit alles bleef in eendracht in gebed en smeking, met de vrouwen, en Maria, de moeder van Jezus, en met zijn broeders (Handelingen 1:12-14).<br/>Dit is de laatste vermelding van Maria, de moeder van Jezus. Op dit punt en vanaf dit punt, is er geen verdere vermelding van haar in de Handelingen van de Apostelen of in de brieven. Geen vermelding van haar dood of van haar wonderbaarlijke hemelvaart, zonder dood. Er staat niets in de Schrift, het is stil.<br/>Zijn broers zouden waarschijnlijk een verwijzing zijn naar Jakobus en Judas en naar die andere broers die zonen van Jozef en Maria waren.<br/>Er zijn sommigen die zeggen dat het dezelfde bovenzaal is waarin Jezus het Laatste Avondmaal had met Zijn discipelen. En toch zijn er anderen die deze bovenzaal vasthouden als een kamer in de tempelwijken waar de vroege kerk bijeenkwam. Maak je keuze.<br/>En in die dagen stond Petrus op in het midden der discipelen, en zeide: Mannen en broeders, deze Schrift moet vervuld zijn, die de Heilige Geest door den mond van David gesproken heeft over Judas, die een leidsman was tot hen, die Jezus grepen (Handelingen 1:15-16).<br/>Opnieuw staat Petrus nog steeds zijn zelfde onophoudelijke zelf, ze wachten in gebed en smeekbeden, en Petrus staat op en zegt: "Mannen, er is een geschrift dat vervuld moet worden." En je weet dat hij verder zal gaan, "Laten we het programma aan de gang krijgen; laten we loten en uitzoeken wie Judas' plaats gaat innemen." Ik heb het gevoel dat Petrus weer in het vlees was, en dat ongestoorde karakter manifesteerde dat van hem was. En ik denk dat de toekomstige geschiedenis van de kerk in het boek Handelingen dit aantoont. Ik ben geïnteresseerd in Petrus' begrip van de Schriften, hoe hij uit zoveel plaatsen in het Oude Testament citeert. Petrus geeft blijk van een zeer groot begrip van de Oudtestamentische geschriften, wat een punt in zijn voordeel is.<br/>Merk op dat Petrus aan de Heilige Geest de dingen toeschrijft die David schreef. Dus, "Alle Schrift is gegeven door inspiratie van God" ( 2Ti 3:16 ). Niet een deel van de Schriften. Want als je me vertelt dat een deel van de Schriften door inspiratie van God wordt gegeven, dan moet ik je vragen: "Welke delen zijn door inspiratie en welke delen zijn niet door inspiratie?" En dan ben je de autoriteit die me vertelt welk deel ik kan geloven en welk deel ik niet kan geloven... en het moment dat God niet langer het gezag is, maar jij het gezag bent, zit ik in de problemen. Pas op voor degenen die zeggen: "Wel, u kunt niet alle Schriften geloven." De Schriften zelf zeggen: "Alle Schriften zijn gegeven door de inspiratie van God." En hier, Lukas schrijft over wat Petrus zei, verklaart dat David in feite de woordvoerder was voor de Heilige Geest. De Heilige Geest sprak door de mond van David over Judas.<br/>Want hij was bij ons gerekend, hij had een deel van deze bediening verkregen; maar nu kocht hij een akker met de loon der ongerechtigheid, en viel op zijn rug (Handelingen 1:17-18),<br/>Hij kocht het veld, het veld van de pottenbakker, zoals Zacharias het elfde hoofdstuk verklaart.<br/>En hij viel op zijn hoofd en brak in het midden, en al zijn ingewanden stroomden uit (Hand.1:18).<br/>Er zijn mensen die een discrepantie in de Schriften vinden, want in een van de evangeliën wordt ons verteld dat toen Judas terugkwam en probeerde het geld terug te geven, ze zeiden: "Hé, het is jouw probleem. We kunnen het niet aannemen." "Het is bloedgeld." Toen gooide hij het daar op de vloer van de tempel en hij ging naar buiten en hing zichzelf op. Hier vertelt Petrus ons dat hij op zijn kop viel en net klopte. En er zijn mensen die zich een discrepantie voorstellen. Heel eenvoudig ging hij de boom in om zichzelf op te hangen, bond het touw om zijn hals en bond het aan zijn ledemaat en sprong. En de kracht van de val greep het touw of zijn hoofd, en hij viel in de canyon en net zoals hij het hier zei.<br/>Het was bekend bij alle inwoners van Jeruzalem, zodat het veld in hun eigen taal Akeldama wordt genoemd, dat wil zeggen: het veld van bloed. Want er staat geschreven in het boek der Psalmen: Laat zijn woonplaats woest worden, en laat niemand daarin wonen; en laat zijn bisschop een ander nemen (Hand.1:19-20).<br/>Nu citeert hij in werkelijkheid uit twee verschillende Psalmen hier. Uit Ps 69:25 ,heeft hij het samengevoegd met Ps 109:8 . En de twee samengevoegd vindt hij deze profetieën over Judas.<br/>Daarom van deze mannen (Handelingen 1:21)<br/>Nu, hier is waar ze iemand zoeken om Judas' plaats in te nemen om een apostel te zijn. Hier zijn de kwalificaties die ze in die tijd zochten.<br/>Daarom van deze mannen, die met ons geweest zijn al de tijd, dat de Heere Jezus in en uit onder ons is (Hand.1:21),<br/>Nu herinnert u zich dat er vele discipelen waren, vele discipelen waarvan Jezus tien koos om apostelen te zijn. En het woord apostel betekent "één die uitgezonden is." Of twaalf koos om apostelen te zijn, dus zond Hij de twaalf uit. Het aantal menselijke heerschappij. "We hebben er maar elf. We hebben er één nodig om de plaats van Judas in te nemen, maar we hebben er één nodig die al de hele tijd bij ons is geweest vanaf het begin met Jezus."<br/>Vanaf het moment dat hij door Johannes werd gedoopt, tot op de dag dat hij van ons werd opgenomen, moet iemand worden geordineerd om een getuige [van wat?] te zijn van zijn opstanding (Handelingen 1:22 ).<br/>Dus dit waren de vereisten die zij zochten. Iemand die de hele tijd rond was geweest. Van de doop van Johannes tot de hemelvaart. En iemand die de verrezen Heer zag, en zo kon dragen feit van de opstanding, hun getuigenis aan het feit.<br/>Paulus de apostel, die later beweerde dat hij een apostel was, zei: "Heb ik de opgestane Christus niet gezien?" Blijkbaar was dat een van de vereisten van het apostelschap. Iemand vroeg me: "Zijn er vandaag apostelen?" Nou, ik weet het niet. Ik denk niet dat er in dezelfde zin zijn als zij in het Nieuwe Testament waren. Er is zeker niemand die vandaag de dag kan getuigen van de opstanding als zij deden.<br/>En zij stelden twee aan, Jozef genaamd Barsabas, bijgenaamd Justus, en Matthias; en zij baden en zeiden: Gij, Heere, Die de harten van alle mensen kent, laat zien, of van deze twee, die Gij uitverkoren hebt,<br/>Ik denk dat we vaak deze fout maken om de Heer twee keuzes te geven, beide verkeerd. God beperken, zie je. We zijn zo geneigd om dit te doen. Het is duidelijk dat Paulus Gods keuze was. Petrus was onrustig, en hij sprong met het pistool en zei: "Hey, we moeten iets doen, weet je, we moeten God helpen. Weet je, er ontbreekt er een en we moeten hem vullen." En toch, "God, welke van deze twee wil je?" En God de twee keuzes geven.<br/>Opdat hij deel zou hebben aan deze bediening en dit apostelschap, waarvan Judas door de overtreding viel, opdat hij naar zijn eigen plaats zou gaan. En zo gaven zij hun lot uit (Handelingen 1:25-26);<br/>Een interessante manier waarop ze probeerden de wil van God te bepalen. Laten we dobbelstenen gooien, erachter komen wat Gods wil hier is. Het is interessant voor mij, de verschillende manieren die mensen hebben bedacht om de wil van God te onderscheiden. Nu, in de tijden van het Oude Testament hadden ze een interessante manier om naar de priester te komen, die de Heer voor hen zou vragen door de Urim en de Thummim, de "lichten en volmaaktheden". Ik weet zeker dat het niet de gekleurde bril was die Joseph Smith vond met de Gouden Tafelen; de magische bril, dat als je ze aandoet, je plotseling de hiërogliefen kon lezen.<br/>Er zijn mensen die zeggen dat de Urim en de Thummim eigenlijk een zwarte en een witte steen waren die in een zak op de borst van de priester werd gedragen. Ze zouden bidden en de Heer een bepaalde vraag stellen. Herinnert u zich dat David de Heer bepaalde vragen stelde: "Heer, zullen wij uittrekken tegen de Filistijnen?" Hij antwoordde: "Nee." Dus weer, de volgende dag, "Heer, zullen wij uittrekken tegen de Filistijnen?" Hij antwoordde: "Ja." "Wanneer zullen wij uittrekken?" Ze zouden specifieke vragen stellen, en de Heer zou hen door de Urim en de Thummin leiden. Ze zeggen dat de priester zou bidden, God zoeken, en dan een van de twee stenen zou bereiken en eruit trekken. Als het de witte steen was, was het een ja-antwoord. Als het een nee was, dan zou het de zwarte steen zijn die hij eruit zou trekken. Sommigen zeggen zelfs dat we de term blackballed krijgen van deze Urim en Thummim. Eigenlijk, terug in het origineel is het een nee stem tegen een bepaald project of idee. Wat de Urim en Thummim precies waren, weten we niet, maar tijdens de Oudtestamentische periode gebruikten ze een methode om loten te werpen om de wil van God te bepalen.<br/>Dus hier nemen de discipelen hetzelfde op als ze de dobbelstenen gooien om te zien welke van de twee medemensen God had gekozen om Judas Iskariot te vervangen.<br/>Het lot viel op Matthias; hij werd geteld met de elf (Handelingen 1:26).<br/>Wie in de wereld is Matthias? Niemand heeft ooit eerder of sindsdien van hem gehoord. Het zal interessant zijn om Matthias te ontmoeten en erachter te komen wie hij is en wat hij heeft gedaan. Ik denk dat het uit de daaropvolgende geschiedenis duidelijk is om aan te nemen dat God Paulus als apostel heeft gekozen. Nu is dit de laatste keer dat wij over hen lezen, dat wij de wil van God trachten te onderscheiden door loting of door een of ander toeval.<br/>Ik ken vandaag een medemens, die de wil van de Heer probeert te onderscheiden, zal bidden en de Heer een vraag stellen. Hij zal tien centen in zijn zak hebben, en terwijl hij bidt, zal hij de centen met zijn ogen gesloten nemen en ze op de tafel leggen, en als ze allemaal opkomen, is het een ja. Interessant, af en toe komen ze allemaal op hun kop, en dat is een vrij goede kans. Toch vinden we hier geen patroon voor nadat de Heilige Geest werd gegeven. Toen de Heilige Geest over de gemeente kwam, begon de Heilige Geest tot hen te spreken en hen te leiden, en de Heilige Geest zei: "Separateer Paulus en Barnabas voor mij voor de bediening waar ik hen geroepen heb" (Handelingen 13:2). En de Heilige Geest zond hen uit. Dus vinden we de gemeente directer geleid door de Heilige Geest. Toen de Heilige Geest kwam, werd deze dobbelsteen weggegooid om de wil van God te ontdekken.<br/>"<br/><br/>King James versie<br/><br/>Dit is de 1769 King James Version van de Heilige Bijbel (ook bekend als de Authorized Version). |

Yes that is correct, the Urbanears don't have a built in noise cancelling mic on the headphone itself but from what I can see there is a mic on the cable provided.<br/>1.

In fact, dynamic drivers work exactly the same as dynamic microphones but in reverse. Inside a dynamic driver there is a magnet, and when you plug in the headphones, you are sending a AC current through it which will turn the voice coil into a magnet. Depending on the direction of the current, the polarity of the magnet will change. Now since we know for a magnet, same charges repels and different charges attract, we know that the voice coil will move back and forth depending on it's polarity at the time. The voice coil is attached to the diaphragm which will then move back and forth creating a sound wave. The same occurs in reverse, if you move a coil through a magnet you produce a current instead. Since your voice is pushing the diaphragm, it is moving the voice coil back and forth generating the current you have observed.<br/><br/>100+ Head-Fier<br/><br/>Joined:<br/>Nov 7, 2011<br/><br/>Posts:<br/>134<br/><br/>Likes: 55<br/><br/>Exactly.

In feite werken dynamische drivers precies hetzelfde als dynamische microfoons, maar omgekeerd. In een dynamische driver zit een magneet en wanneer je de koptelefoon insteekt, stuur je er een AC-stroom doorheen die de stemspoel in een magneet verandert. Afhankelijk van de richting van de stroom verandert de polariteit van de magneet. Nu we weten voor een magneet, dezelfde ladingen afstoot en verschillende ladingen aantrekken, weten we dat de stemspoel heen en weer zal bewegen, afhankelijk van de polariteit op dat moment. De stemspoel is bevestigd aan het membraan dat vervolgens heen en weer beweegt en een geluidsgolf creëert. Hetzelfde gebeurt in omgekeerde richting, als je een spoel door een magneet beweegt, produceert je in plaats daarvan een stroom. Omdat je stem het diafragma duwt, beweegt het de stemspoel heen en weer en genereert de stroom die je hebt waargenomen.<br/><br/>Meer dan 100 Head-Fier<br/><br/>Toegetreden:<br/>7 nov 2011<br/><br/>Berichten:<br/>134<br/><br/>Vind ik leuks: 55<br/><br/>Precies.

Stalin's opposition within the party, including Bukharin, Yagoda and Rykov were purged in these show trials, as Stalin manipulatively forced them to confess to crimes of planning a coup and opposing the state, even if there was no proof. Gabor T Rittersporn said, "Many of the victims were sincerely devoted to the principles of Bolshevism." This amplifies proof that the Bolshevik ideals that had once been the roots of the Communist Party were being disarranged and destroyed by the Purges. The party was depleted and former members helplessly watched Stalin use the great purge as a tool to transform Russia from a one party state to an unchallenged dictatorship. Again, the purges were shattering the framework of the Communist Party, formed during the Bolshevik revolution. This agrees with the "Stalin the executioner" source as both show the manipulative character, that helped the dictator to enhance his grip on Russia's throat.<br/>The manipulative manner, with which Stalin incriminated his targeted opposition during the purges, in the eyes of everyday Russians, also had an implosive impact on Soviet Society. Stalin was able to collect support from the people through his use of propaganda and the media to help him develop a "cult of personality" and the image of a heroic and brave leader. Through this support Stalin implanted mistrust into the minds of the people, convincing them that traitors of the revolution and what he described as 'enemies of the people', were amongst them.

Gabor T Rittersporn zei: "Veel van de slachtoffers waren oprecht toegewijd aan de principes van het bolsjewisme." Dit versterkt het bewijs dat de bolsjewistische idealen die ooit de wortels van de Communistische Partij waren, werden ontwricht en vernietigd door de Zuiveringen. De partij was uitgeput en voormalige leden keken hulpeloos toe hoe Stalin de grote zuivering gebruikte als een instrument om Rusland te transformeren van een eenpartijstaat naar een onbetwiste dictatuur.

| Supercell is nerfing brawlers instead of nerfing star powers. I was at 750 last season with power 8 nita and it is very tough to go past that, like, star powers play a really dominant role. The matchmaking is also trash. When i play gem grab(around 600 trophies), there are often matchups where the enemy team has one more player than us who is maxed and it's not even that we have a lvl 9 to compete versus that. Sometimes there are even matchups where the enemy team is fully maxed and none of us are. this is why i dont play brawl stars seriously anymore. It's not even like there arent many players who are not maxed and around 600 trophies. It's annoying.<br/>Edit: I think supercell should have at least a basic mechanism that takes the average of levels of brawlers when setting up matches.<br/><br/>Except trophies don't really indicate your skill. They indicate the skill of the teammates you are placed with. And I'm fine with playing against higher level brawlers, but when one team is all level 10 and the other team isn't, clearly it's unbalanced.<br/><br/>I reccomend getting some good friends to play with, me and 2 friends got my friends power 1 tick to rank 28 by playing gem grab with a certain composition all day and we made it without a single one of us being maxed with our brawlers.<br/><br/>I Know how you feel I used to have brawlers in high trophies with low level and it's to difficult to go more further and everything I was saying to myself "I want to have star powers" really supercell needs to make balance to the star powers or at least make a better matchmaking system.<br/><br/>I kinda feel this. I ain't as good at the game as you, but I got Emz to 500 at power 1 and the matchmaking was horrible. Maxed out players everywhere! And it didn't help that the majority of my teammates had around 5-8k trophies... I had to resort to solo showdown last minute because I can either ambush unsuspecting players or simply play a little aggressive at the right times. But I really wish that it could be a bit easier for people who want to push brawlers to really high trophy ranges without having the luxury of star powers.<br/><br/>Altho spike is still good without curveball. Curveball was just a help for hitting your shots more often as spike. But even before curveball was released, spike was a really strong brawler, so he will remain the same now.<br/><br/>I agree that they should have nerfed ambush, but I think they are trying to balance both Snappy Sniping and Ambush, as they are both getting merged with this change. She was becoming a little powerful, but still not nerf-worthy<br/><br/>I'm not sure about this, but now that Darryl got a noticeable buff, looking at their new stats, it looks like Darryl might overshadow Bull, as not only he can always deal more damage than Bull, he won't die as early anymore, so their survivability will be similar without star power (although Bull's survivability is still noticeably better than Darryl's if he had Tough Guy). Not only that, Darryl's super can auto regenerate, meaning Darryl MIGHT be able to be played effectively both as a heavyweight AND an assassin at the same time (before he sucks as a heavyweight but decent as an assassin)<br/><br/>But hes overrated af. And you get trophies with him really easily. So im kinda ok with the nerf. I havent even played him since when I got him to 500 (around 5 months ago), so not that I care that much either.<br/><br/>Why doesn't Poco/Penny get a HP nerf, if they are Marksman/Healer respectively not a tank?<br/>Why isn't Rosa's tankyness nerfed, cough 70% damage reduction?<br/>Why is Tick allowed to have the highest range and the most free pokedamage in the entire game?<br/>Why doesn't Leon get a HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Be that as it may, it was Ambush that was OP, not base Piper. I would argue that Ambush is the best star power in the game (now even more so since the percentage of damage increase indirectly went up) and base Piper was a bottom-10 brawler.<br/><br/>What Supercell should do is revert both nerfs, reduce Ambush to 600, and reduce Snappy Sniping to 0.25 since it'd be indirectly buffed by the base damage buff.<br/><br/>Yea and I believe they went a bit too far with Rosa, because now she is basically the better bull now when it comes to tanking, which she has been for a while. Now, Darryl might as well be a smaller, more powerful bull<br/><br/>Why? I feel she needs a buff in almost everything except her star power. Her health and speed make her super a bit more difficult to use, because she can die pretty easily, and it is really difficult for her to trap faster brawlers like Crow. Her star power is a bit broken though... | Supercell is nerfing brawlers in plaats van nerfing star powers. Ik was op 750 vorig seizoen met power 8 nita en het is erg moeilijk om voorbij te gaan dat, zoals, sterrenkrachten een echt dominante rol spelen. De matchmaking is ook prullenbak. Wanneer ik gem grab (ongeveer 600 trofeeën) speel, zijn er vaak matchups waarbij het vijandelijke team een andere speler heeft dan wij die gemaximaliseerd is en het is niet eens dat we een lvl 9 hebben om te concurreren tegen dat. Soms zijn er zelfs matchups waarbij het vijandelijke team volledig is gemaximaliseerd en niemand van ons dat is. daarom speel ik niet meer serieus ruziesterren. Het is niet eens alsof er niet veel spelers zijn die niet gemaximaliseerd zijn en ongeveer 600 trofeeën. Het is vervelend.<br/>Bewerken: Ik denk dat supercell minstens een basismechanisme moet hebben dat het gemiddelde van de niveaus van brawlers neemt bij het opzetten van matches.<br/><br/>Behalve trofeeën geven niet echt je vaardigheid aan. Ze geven de vaardigheid aan van de teamgenoten waarmee je wordt geplaatst. En ik ben prima met het spelen tegen vechters op een hoger niveau, maar als het ene team allemaal niveau 10 is en het andere team dat niet is, is het duidelijk onevenwichtig.<br/><br/>Ik adviseer het krijgen van een aantal goede vrienden om mee te spelen, ik en 2 vrienden kregen mijn vrienden power 1 tick naar rang 28 door het spelen van edelsteen grijpen met een bepaalde compositie de hele dag en we maakten het zonder dat een van ons werd maxed met onze brawlers.<br/><br/>Ik weet hoe je voelt dat ik vroeger vechters had in hoge trofeeën met een laag niveau en het is te moeilijk om verder te gaan en alles wat ik tegen mezelf zei "Ik wil sterkrachten hebben" moet echt supercel zijn om het evenwicht te herstellen met de sterkrachten of op zijn minst een beter matchmakingsysteem te maken.<br/><br/>Ik voel dit. Ik ben niet zo goed in het spel als jij, maar ik kreeg Emz tot 500 op macht 1 en de matchmaking was verschrikkelijk. Maxed out spelers overal! En het hielp niet dat de meerderheid van mijn teamgenoten hadden rond 5-8k trofeeën... Ik moest op het laatste moment een solo showdown doen, omdat ik ofwel nietsvermoedende spelers kan hinderen of gewoon een beetje agressief kan spelen op de juiste tijden. Maar ik wou echt dat het een beetje makkelijker zou kunnen zijn voor mensen die vechters naar echt hoge trofeeën willen duwen zonder de luxe van sterkrachten te hebben.<br/><br/>Altho spike is nog steeds goed zonder curveball. Curveball was gewoon een hulpmiddel om je schoten vaker als spike te raken. Maar zelfs voordat curveball werd vrijgegeven, was spike een echt sterke brawler, dus hij zal nu hetzelfde blijven.<br/><br/>Ik ben het ermee eens dat ze een hinderlaag hadden moeten maken, maar ik denk dat ze proberen om zowel Snappy Sniping als Ambush in balans te brengen, omdat ze beiden worden samengevoegd met deze verandering. Ze werd een beetje krachtig, maar nog steeds niet zenuwwaardig<br/><br/>Ik weet het niet zeker, maar nu Darryl een merkbare buff heeft gekregen, kijkend naar hun nieuwe statistieken, lijkt het erop dat Darryl Bull zou kunnen overschaduwen, omdat hij niet alleen altijd meer schade kan toebrengen dan Bull, hij zal niet zo vroeg sterven, dus hun overlevingskansen zullen vergelijkbaar zijn zonder sterkracht (hoewel Bull's overlevingskansen nog steeds merkbaar beter zijn dan Darryl's). Niet alleen dat, Darryl's super kan automatisch regenereren, wat betekent dat Darryl MIGHT effectief kan worden gespeeld als een zwaargewicht EN een moordenaar op hetzelfde moment (voordat hij zuigt als een zwaargewicht, maar fatsoenlijk als een moordenaar)<br/><br/>Maar hij is overgewaardeerd af. En je krijgt trofeeën met hem heel gemakkelijk. Dus im kinda ok met de zenuw. Ik heb hem zelfs niet gespeeld sinds toen ik hem tot 500 (ongeveer 5 maanden geleden) kreeg, dus het kan me ook niet zoveel schelen.<br/><br/>Waarom krijgt Poco/Penny geen HP-nerv, als ze respectievelijk Marksman/Healer zijn en geen tank?<br/>Waarom is Rosa's tankiness niet zenuwachtig, hoest 70% schadevermindering?<br/>Waarom is Tick toegestaan om het hoogste bereik en de meest gratis pokedamage in het hele spel te hebben?<br/>Waarom krijgt Leon geen HP/Damage buff?<br/><br/>Hoe het ook zij, het was Ambush die OP was, niet basis Piper. Ik zou beweren dat Ambush de beste sterkracht in het spel is (nu nog meer omdat het percentage schadeverhoging indirect steeg) en basis Piper een bodem-10 brawler was.<br/><br/>Wat Supercell moet doen is beide zenuwen omkeren, Ambush verminderen tot 600, en Snappy Sniping verminderen tot 0,25 omdat het indirect zou worden opgeblazen door de basisschadebuff.<br/><br/>Ja en ik denk dat ze een beetje te ver gingen met Rosa, want nu is ze in principe de betere stier nu als het gaat om tanken, wat ze al een tijdje is.<br/><br/>Waarom? Ik heb het gevoel dat ze een buff nodig heeft in bijna alles behalve haar sterkracht. Haar gezondheid en snelheid maken haar super een beetje moeilijker te gebruiken, omdat ze vrij gemakkelijk kan sterven, en het is echt moeilijk voor haar om snellere vechters zoals Crow te vangen. Haar sterkracht is een beetje gebroken, hoewel... |

| Self-Employment Part 1<br/><br/>When you accept an employment in any organisation, you have to perform various jobs as per the requirements of your employer and you may get a fixed amount of income as salary. You may run a small retail shop, tailoring shop, restaurant, bakery and confectionery, beauty salon, etc. in your locality. You may get engaged in trading or manufacturing on a small scale or providing some service for a price. Such economic activities are known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Meaning of Self-Employment<br/><br/>Earning is necessary for a living. Our father, mother, brothers, sisters and others may be engaged in different economic activities through which they earn their livelihood. These persons are engaged in an economic activity which is termed as wage employment or paid employment. But there are many persons who engage themselves in an occupation or some business which they start and manage on their own. They put in their best effort and take all types of risks to pursue their careers successfully. The entire earning of their work goes to them. All of us have seen small grocery shops, tailoring shops, medical stores etc. in our locality. These are owned and managed by a person, with or without the help of some assistants. Their economic activities are termed as self-employment. So, when an individual engages in any economic activity and manages it on his own, it is known as self-employment.<br/><br/>Objectives<br/><br/>After studying this lesson, you will be able to:<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Image of Objectives<br/><br/>Characteristics of Self-Employment<br/><br/>It involves ownership and management of activities by a person although he/she may take the help of one or two persons to assist him/her. Thus, self-employment may provide employment to other persons as well.<br/><br/>The earning from self-employment is not fixed. It depends on the income one can earn by producing or buying and selling goods or providing services to others at a price.<br/><br/>In self-employment, the owner alone has to take the profit and bear the risk of loss. So, we find a direct link between the effort and reward in self-employment.<br/><br/>It requires some amount of capital investment, although it may be small.<br/><br/>In self-employment, a person is free to take decisions in respect of running his business profitably and avail of any opportunity that may come up for expansion of his business. It gives complete freedom to work as per one's own will and within the parameters of the prevailing laws.<br/><br/>Thus, self-employment may be defined as, an economic activity which one may perform on his own as a gainful occupation, and this may consist of producing and selling goods, buying and selling goods, or rendering services for a price. | Zelfstandigheid deel 1<br/><br/>Wanneer u een baan in een organisatie accepteert, moet u verschillende banen uitvoeren volgens de eisen van uw werkgever en u kunt een vast bedrag van het inkomen als salaris krijgen. U kunt een kleine winkel, kleermakerij, restaurant, bakker en banketbakkerij, schoonheidssalon, enz. in uw omgeving runnen. U kunt zich bezighouden met handel of productie op kleine schaal of het verstrekken van enige service voor een prijs. Zulke economische activiteiten staan bekend als zelfstandigen.<br/><br/>Betekenis van zelfwerkzaamheid<br/><br/>Verdienen is noodzakelijk voor het levensonderhoud. Onze vader, moeder, broers, zussen en anderen kunnen zich bezighouden met verschillende economische activiteiten waardoor ze hun levensonderhoud verdienen. Deze personen zijn bezig met een economische activiteit die loonarbeid of betaalde arbeid wordt genoemd, maar er zijn veel mensen die zich bezighouden met een beroep of een bedrijf dat ze zelf starten en beheren. Ze zetten hun best in en nemen alle soorten risico's om hun carrière succesvol na te streven. De volledige opbrengst van hun werk gaat naar hen. We hebben allemaal kleine supermarkten, kleermakers, medische winkels etc. in onze buurt gezien. Deze zijn eigendom van en worden beheerd door een persoon, met of zonder de hulp van sommige assistenten. Hun economische activiteiten worden zelfbeschikking genoemd. Wanneer een individu dus een economische activiteit uitoefent en deze zelfstandig beheert, staat het bekend als zelfbeschikking.<br/><br/>Doelstellingen<br/><br/>Na het bestuderen van deze les, zult u in staat zijn om:<br/><br/>Beeld van doelstellingen<br/><br/>Beeld van doelstellingen<br/><br/>Kenmerken van zelfwerkzaamheid<br/><br/>Het gaat om het bezit en het beheer van activiteiten door een persoon, hoewel hij/zij de hulp van een of twee personen kan gebruiken om hem/haar te helpen.<br/><br/>Het inkomen uit zelfstandige arbeid is niet vast, het hangt af van het inkomen dat men kan verdienen door goederen te produceren of te kopen en te verkopen of diensten te verlenen aan anderen tegen een prijs.<br/><br/>In de zelfstandigheid moet alleen de eigenaar de winst nemen en het risico van verlies dragen. Dus vinden we een direct verband tussen de inspanning en de beloning in de zelfstandigheid.<br/><br/>Het vereist een zekere hoeveelheid kapitaalinvestering, hoewel het klein kan zijn.<br/><br/>In zelfstandige arbeid is een persoon vrij om beslissingen te nemen met betrekking tot het runnen van zijn bedrijf winstgevend en maakt gebruik van elke gelegenheid die zich kan voordoen voor de uitbreiding van zijn bedrijf. Het geeft volledige vrijheid om te werken volgens de eigen wil en binnen de parameters van de heersende wetten.<br/><br/>Zelfstandigheid kan dus worden gedefinieerd als een economische activiteit die men op zichzelf als een winstgevend beroep kan verrichten, en dit kan bestaan uit het produceren en verkopen van goederen, het kopen en verkopen van goederen of het verlenen van diensten voor een prijs. |
