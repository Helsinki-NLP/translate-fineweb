| The Masterpiece: a Chain Poetry Challenge<br/><br/>John has been writing poetry since his school days. He was awarded the "Best Poet 2014 and 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet in a Japanese kimono, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>A Brief History of Collaborative, Collective, or Chain Poetry<br/><br/>Collaborative,collective, or chain poetry is an alternative and creative technique for writing poetry by more than one person. The principal aim of this type of poetry is to create poems through the collaboration of various authors/poets, trying to form a unified voice while still maintain their individual voices.<br/><br/>Examples of collaboration abound in Japanese poetry. Though the precise accounts and records of many such events are either lost or missing.<br/><br/>One of the most famous examples of collective poetry writing was the poem collection titled Ralentir Travaux by Surrealist French poets André Breton, Paul Éluard and René Char. These three poets collaborated to write the poems in this collection over just five days in 1930.<br/><br/>During the 1940s, Charles Henri Ford, an American poet, invented what he called the "chain poem", where each poet wrote a line and then sent the poem to another person (to continue) in another part of the world, by post.<br/><br/>In 2007 a collection of American collaborative poetry Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry was edited and published by Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton and David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Collaborative poetry writing has been used in schools and colleges to teach students teamwork and to discover ways in which they are connected.(source: Wikipedia)<br/><br/>Study of a Figure Outdoors: Woman with a Parasol, facing left, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain or Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Aim of This Article and How to Approach the Challenge<br/><br/>A few years back I wrote an article called "Poem Without an End" which included a Christmas poem I had written that lent itself to being added to. I was amazed by the response as at that stage I only had a few followers here. People wrote a stanza of poetry each in "comments" on the hub to follow on from the previous commenter's stanza. It worked out very well and at the end I compiled all the contributions into a single poem as part of the hub.<br/><br/>Similar challenges have been issued since, including one by Frank Atanacio called "Spirits Sat as Mourners" that was also very successful. The difference being that in that instance contributors wrote their own hubs for their stanza of poetry and placed a link on Frank's original hub.<br/><br/>For this particular challenge I don't expect everyone to spend valuable time writing separate hubs for one stanza of poetry (unless you really want to). The main problem being that to make it effective you would have to copy the previously written parts of the poem onto your hub and would probably be hit with "duplication" label.<br/><br/>So, that being the case, and also to save having to leave links everywhere, I just ask that anyone who wants to take part just write their stanza here in "comments." Check the last comment before yours that is contributing to the challenge and follow on. If I see more than one following from the same stanza I will use my poetic licence to work them in as I deem best.<br/><br/>At some stage when I feel there has been enough stanzas added I will probably call an end to the challenge and then compile them all together as the completed poem as part of the article (also giving credit to each contributor).<br/><br/>Flowered Riverbank, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>The Challenge!<br/><br/>Now comes the interesting part. If you join this chain poetry challenge you have to try to keep the style and voice of the poem as close as possible to the preceding verses, so that to uninformed readers it will appear that only one author has written the entire poem.<br/><br/>Sounds easy, you say? Well maybe it would be if the poem had a traditional style, rhyme or meter. But this one doesn't! The poem you will be adding to was started by an acquaintance of mine Andriealphus as a "chain poem challenge" elsewhere. At the time of writing I was the only other person who had accepted the challenge, and because I loved the subject I thought it would be a great challenge for my fellow writers and decided to use it here and see if the response would be better. (I know of a few poets here whose writing would suit this style)<br/><br/>Rules :<br/><br/>Follow on from the previous stanza in comments<br/><br/>Try to retain the voice and style of the poem<br/><br/>Keep your stanza/verse to approximately the same length as those before<br/><br/>Claude Monet was one of the most famous painters in the history of art and a leading figure in the Impressionist movement.<br/><br/>In 1883 Monet moved to Giverny. Here, he loved to paint outdoors in the gardens that he helped create. The water lilies found in the pond had a particular appeal, and he painted several series of them throughout the rest of his life; the Japanese-style bridge over the pond became the subject of several works, as well.<br/><br/>In 1912 Monet painted a series of 12 waterlily paintings commissioned by the Orangerie des Tuileries, a museum in Paris. He chose to make them on a very large scale, and to serve as a "haven of peaceful meditation." This project consumed much of Monet's later years. Monet once stated, "These landscapes of water and reflection have become an obsession for me. It is beyond my strength as an old man, and yet I want to render what I feel."<br/><br/>His health was now an obstacle, as well. Nearly blind, with both of his eyes seriously affected by cataracts, Monet finally agreed to undergo surgery for the ailment in 1923.<br/><br/>Monet's famous water lilies turned redder as his cataracts progressed. After getting corrective surgery he destroyed most of the "red lily" paintings, angry that no one really mentioned it to him. Ironically, these paintings were probably what made his impressionistic style so famous in that time -- artists started taking more risks with color and such during this point. (source: biography.com)<br/><br/>The Masterpiece<br/><br/>"The boy sitting behind you says you look like a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ask him, has he ever seen a Monet up close?<br/><br/>Close enough to see nothing but muddled strokes of weedy lakeshore?<br/><br/>Close enough to dip his fingers into the ridges<br/><br/>where oil paints hardened under an artist's gaze?<br/><br/>Close enough to breathe onto the blood lilies?<br/><br/>Ask him, why did he paint them red?" (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>He grinned like Carroll's cheshire cat.<br/><br/>"Through clouded and bloodshot eyes I imagine.<br/><br/>Be my waterlilies!" he says,<br/><br/>"Feel my breath and let my fingers delve,<br/><br/>become my masterpiece instead.<br/><br/>A brush has never touched a canvas as fine as your fair skin.<br/><br/>Let the masters weep in jealousy,<br/><br/>and Van Gogh slice his ear in envy at the beauty of your nakedness."(Jodah)<br/><br/>Self portrait with bandaged ear<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Responses<br/><br/>Now it's your turn. Please write your response in the comments below, remembering to check those immediately before yours for the last written stanza of the poem. If you do decide to write a separate hub for your stanza of verse, make sure you leave a link here in comments.<br/><br/>The Finished Masterpiece<br/><br/>All contributions have been received and I have put the finished poem together with only some slight edits.

And the beauty we can still enjoy today from all his work.<br/><br/>This is a great challenge! I am really looking forward to adding to this.<br/><br/>I first wanted to stop in and let you know that, up for sure. Shared too.<br/><br/>And thank you so much for all the challenges to help the rest of us, keep our mental energy flowing and giving it a work out! You are the best.<br/><br/>The information about LuLu and the free ISBN number is an answered prayer! So, smile my friend. You are a gift!<br/><br/>Hugs. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Marj. I think I may have all the verses that are going to come. I have been doing my best to arrange them as I think best with just a little editing. I will probably post the finished poem as a separate hub with a link on this one to it. My book is available on Lulu and iBooks...there's a link on one of the earlier comments. I'd really appreciate it if you were to purhase a copy. Bear in mind it's my first eBook so the formatting etc isn't perfect, but it's taken me seven revisions I think to get it where it is. It will all be easier next time. If you need help let me know.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on August 12, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John, you have certainly had some excellent responses to your challenge - I'm sure you'll fuse it altogether beautifully although I imagine a difficult task. I'm interested in your poetry books also - I really have to get my act together technologically - I'll try and check it all out...cheers -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, both books 'On the Wings of Eagles" and "I Laughed a Smile" have mostly the same content...except the former has one extra poem. Originally they were in different formats, one ePub, the other PDF but now they are both ePub. They are available through Lulu and iBooks, soon Barnes and Noble and Nook (not Amazon). I may try publishing another book through Amazon soon just to see how it compares. Thanks again.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thanks a lot, the info on publishing with Lulu will be quite useful as I'm thinking of publishing but I'm currently torn between Amazon and Lulu. I wanted to purchase one of your books, but I couldn't seem to find them on Amazon. However, I'll probably get it from Lulu. Wishing you every success, you deserve it.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hey Phyllis, thanks for ontributing. I like it, a perfect ending to the poem I think.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, I think I have sorted out the poem satisfactorily. Just waiting to see if there is any more to add. Publishing with Lulu wasn't bad and now that I've done it once it will be easier next time. Getting the formatting to look right in the eBook was the hardest, though you and just type it in a word document and Lulu automatically produces the contents page and converts the document to ePub or PDF you can only use certain fonts and have to make sure the chapter names or poem titles are in Heading 1. They also provide a free ISBN number if you want. Overall it was easier than expected however.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 11, 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, this is succinct and beautiful, I love it. Shyron's did an excellent job also, I thought I'd already commented on her verse, but I hadn't.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle Burns from High desert of Nevada. on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Wonderful hub, great idea, Jodah. Here is one from me. Short but sweet. Hope it is okay:<br/><br/>And this the beauty be<br/><br/>From Masters past we see<br/><br/>Impressed upon the boy<br/><br/>Bestowed on her with joy<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks John and Jo. You are kind. Jo, you have always been a brilliant poet. I, too, am looking forward to the end result after John does his magic to pull it all together.<br/><br/>I will share again to see if there are any more takers.<br/><br/>Blessings<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Faith, beautifully done, I find it incredible how someone with such limited vision can teach us so much about beauty, light and shadows. John, looking forward to reading the end result.<br/><br/>By the way, congtats on publishing your poems. How did you find the process of publishing with Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for your great submission Faith. No it's not too late, I'm still compiling the final poem so it should be up for all to see in a day or two.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper from southern USA on August 10, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John,<br/><br/>I apologize for my late submission here to your wonderful challenge. I am off from work a couple of day and decided to give this a go while my husband is resting from knee surgery. If it does not meet with your standards, please feel free to not use it in your final poem or edit as you deem necessary.<br/><br/>Blessings always<br/><br/>Here it goes:<br/><br/>Confessions to friend Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>Of light encapsulating both torment, joy<br/><br/>Fervent madness in analyzing colors<br/><br/>Consequential spontaneous creations<br/><br/>Season after season of obsession<br/><br/>Capturing different hues in a single moment<br/><br/>Attentive while strolling in Argenteuill<br/><br/>Brushwork bares masterpiece.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 09, 2015:<br/><br/>Just a shout out to see if anyone else still wants to contribute to this chain poem.

Thanks to all who have contributed.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you Genna. It appears Monet is a favourite arist of many here. I hope you'll take part in this challenge too :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Thank you for a great contribution Shyron. This is a very nice verse. Well done.<br/><br/>Genna East from Massachusetts, USA on August 02, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi John...<br/><br/>I started to read this wonderful challenge (Monet is one of my favorite artists), then came back to finish reading some of the beautiful contributions that give this painting a stunning voice through perception and the senses.

I'm so glad you like my contribution. This is a very good idea, I know you'll have fun putting it all together. Take care and my best to you.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks Deb, yes I am impressed by the standard of submissions. I'm looking forward to putting it all together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Yes Ann, it is good to see the poets among us take up the challenge with some great contributions so far. I just hope Imcan do it justice when it comes to putting it together.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Well done Jo. The word "sublime" comes to mind. I hoped all the poets would rise to the fore, and they have. Love it, thanks for contributing.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt from Stillwater, OK on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>I am excited to see what you end up with here. There are a number of fine poets rising to the challenge, so go to it!<br/><br/>Ann Carr from SW England on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Great one, Jo!<br/><br/>You've got everyone going, John! Rather you than me, putting all this together, but it's going to be a humdinger of a poem when it finally comes to an end - if it ever does! You've really started something.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>Ok, John here goes nothing! Following from Kim's. I hope it reads well.<br/><br/>And the boy began to walk away<br/><br/>But in his wake, I heard him say<br/><br/>"I took a trip to Orangerie<br/><br/>Where the ghost of Monet still abides<br/><br/>I sat right down and gazed awhile<br/><br/>Until I heard a soft voice cry.<br/><br/>"Have you ever seen a fluid dream?<br/><br/>Where light evolves into what it touch<br/><br/>Where serenity flows through cloudy veil<br/><br/>Where the magician's brush like lightening rush<br/><br/>Have you ever seen a sight sublime?<br/><br/>A child born of distorted illusion<br/><br/>This flowering pond that traps the light<br/><br/>That lift the heart and beckons the soul<br/><br/>An abstract pulchritude up close<br/><br/>Move back, behold; such tranquil delight."<br/><br/>I hope this is in line with what the others have done. Feel free to edit if needed.

Anyone is welcome to do more than one stanza. I may add another myself at some stage.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on August 01, 2015:<br/><br/>John, I've decided to have a go, but it's about 16 lines, can I do it in two stanzas following on from Kim's wonderful submission? You can always edit it later.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, sorry to hear you are under the weather at the moment. I am not in a hurry to close this challenge so I'll keep it open until you are back firing on all cylinders and are able to contribute. You are one of the hubbers I was looking forward to getting a response from as I thought it would suit. Thank you for your kind words, and get well soon.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues from Lincolnshire, U.K on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John I can't believe I almost missed your incredible challenged. This is something in which I would have loved to participate since Claude Monet is one of my all times favourite artist. Unfortunately, I must cry off. I'm a bit under the weather with a head full of cotton wool, or so it seems. If the challenge is still open when I get rid of this pesky flu I may give it a go, but I must say, the standard is exceptionally high. Maj took it to another level but all the submissions are brilliant. Kudos to you Andriealphus and the other writers who participated so far in this artistic and creative masterpiece.<br/><br/>My best always Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 31, 2015:<br/><br/>Hi again Maj, glad this poem inspired you, and yes it beats watching the cricket especially with the Aussie batsmen performing badly in this third test. It will be an interesting exercise for me to fuse all the stanzas together but should be good.<br/><br/>travmaj from australia on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>John, thank you, I'm most happy you like my offering. I found the poem intriguing and suddenly felt inspired to write my version in the same mode. I'm not sure I wrote a continuation from the stanza before (alwaysexploring) but I'm sure you will fuse it altogether when the time comes. Love all the responses. I haven't managed any creative writing for yonks, can't wait now to start over, just need some time. (beats watching the cricket too!!!) Cheers John, will be checking in -<br/><br/>John Hansen (author) from Gondwana Land on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Thanks for checking Dana. I am pleased with the quality of responses so far. I just have to wait and see how many more come in. The final,poem should be great.<br/><br/>Dana Tate from LOS ANGELES on July 30, 2015:<br/><br/>Just checking in to see how things are going, I can't wait for the finished product.

Hij werd bekroond met de "Best Poet 2014 and 2021" Hubby Awards.<br/><br/>Madame Monet in een Japanse kimono, 1875<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Een korte geschiedenis van collaboratieve, collectieve of ketenpoëzie<br/><br/>Collaboratieve, collectieve of keten poëzie is een alternatieve en creatieve techniek voor het schrijven van poëzie door meer dan één persoon. Het belangrijkste doel van dit soort poëzie is om gedichten te creëren door de samenwerking van verschillende auteurs / dichters, proberen om een verenigde stem te vormen, terwijl nog steeds het behoud van hun individuele stemmen.<br/><br/>Voorbeelden van samenwerking zijn er in overvloed in de Japanse poëzie. Hoewel de precieze verslagen en verslagen van veel van dergelijke gebeurtenissen verloren zijn gegaan of ontbreken.<br/><br/>Een van de beroemdste voorbeelden van collectief poëzie schrijven was de gedichtencollectie getiteld Ralentir Travaux door surrealistische Franse dichters André Breton, Paul Éluard en René Char. Deze drie dichters werkten samen om de gedichten in deze collectie te schrijven gedurende slechts vijf dagen in 1930.<br/><br/>Tijdens de jaren 1940, Charles Henri Ford, een Amerikaanse dichter, uitgevonden wat hij noemde de "keten gedicht", waarbij elke dichter schreef een regel en vervolgens stuurde het gedicht naar een andere persoon (om door te gaan) in een ander deel van de wereld, per post.<br/><br/>In 2007 werd een collectie van Amerikaanse collaboratieve poëzie Saints of Hysteria: A Half-Century of Collaborative American Poetry uitgegeven door Denise Duhamel, Maureen Seaton en David Trinidad.<br/><br/>Collaboratief poëzie schrijven is gebruikt in scholen en hogescholen om studenten teamwork te leren en manieren te ontdekken waarop ze verbonden zijn.<br/><br/>Studie van een figuur Outdoors: Vrouw met een parasol, naar links, 1886<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Publiek domein of publiek domein], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Het doel van dit artikel en hoe de uitdaging te benaderen<br/><br/>Een paar jaar geleden schreef ik een artikel genaamd "Gedicht zonder einde" dat een kerstgedicht bevatte dat ik had geschreven dat zichzelf leende om eraan te worden toegevoegd. Ik was verbaasd door de reactie omdat ik op dat moment hier slechts een paar volgers had. Mensen schreven elk een poëzie stanza in "opmerkingen" op de hub om te volgen van de vorige commentator's stanza. Het werkte heel goed en aan het einde heb ik alle bijdragen in een enkel gedicht samengesteld als onderdeel van de hub.<br/><br/>Soortgelijke uitdagingen zijn sindsdien uitgegeven, waaronder een door Frank Atanacio genaamd "Spirits Sat as Mourners" die ook zeer succesvol was. Het verschil is dat in dat geval medewerkers hun eigen hubs voor hun poëzie stanza en plaatste een link op Frank's oorspronkelijke hub.<br/><br/>Voor deze bijzondere uitdaging verwacht ik niet dat iedereen kostbare tijd besteedt aan het schrijven van afzonderlijke hubs voor één poëzie stanza (tenzij je dat echt wilt). Het belangrijkste probleem is dat om het effectief te maken, je de eerder geschreven delen van het gedicht op je hub moet kopiëren en waarschijnlijk met het label "duplicatie" zou worden geslagen.<br/><br/>Dus, dat is het geval, en ook om te besparen dat je overal links moet achterlaten, vraag ik gewoon dat iedereen die wil deelnemen gewoon zijn stanza hier in "opmerkingen" schrijft. Controleer de laatste opmerking voor de jouwe die bijdraagt aan de uitdaging en volg. Als ik meer dan één volgeling van dezelfde stanza zie, zal ik mijn poëtische licentie gebruiken om ze in te werken zoals ik dat het beste acht.<br/><br/>Op een gegeven moment dat ik het gevoel heb dat er genoeg stanza's zijn toegevoegd, zal ik waarschijnlijk een einde maken aan de uitdaging en ze vervolgens allemaal samenstellen als het voltooide gedicht als onderdeel van het artikel (ook credit geven aan elke bijdrager).<br/><br/>Gebloemde rivieroever, Argenteuil<br/><br/>Claude Monet [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>De uitdaging!<br/><br/>Nu komt het interessante deel. Als je deelneemt aan deze keten poëzie uitdaging moet je proberen de stijl en stem van het gedicht zo dicht mogelijk bij de voorgaande verzen te houden, zodat het voor niet-geïnformeerde lezers lijkt dat slechts één auteur het hele gedicht heeft geschreven.<br/><br/>Klinkt makkelijk, zeg je? Misschien zou het zijn als het gedicht een traditionele stijl, rijm of meter had. Maar dit is het niet! Het gedicht waar je aan toevoegt werd gestart door een kennis van mijn Andriealphus als een "kettinggedicht uitdaging" elders. Op het moment van schrijven was ik de enige andere persoon die de uitdaging had aanvaard, en omdat ik van het onderwerp hield, dacht ik dat het een grote uitdaging zou zijn voor mijn collega-schrijvers en besloot ik het hier te gebruiken om te zien of het antwoord beter zou zijn. (Ik ken hier een paar dichters wiens schrijven zou passen bij deze stijl)<br/><br/>Regels :<br/><br/>Volg verder van de vorige stanza in reacties<br/><br/>Probeer de stem en stijl van het gedicht te behouden<br/><br/>Houd je stanza/verse op ongeveer dezelfde lengte als voorheen<br/><br/>Claude Monet was een van de beroemdste schilders in de kunstgeschiedenis en een leidende figuur in de impressionistische beweging.<br/><br/>In 1883 verhuisde Monet naar Giverny. Hier schilderde hij graag buiten in de tuinen die hij hielp creëren. De waterlelies in de vijver hadden een bijzondere aantrekkingskracht, en hij schilderde verschillende series van hen gedurende de rest van zijn leven; de Japanse stijl brug over de vijver werd het onderwerp van verschillende werken, ook.<br/><br/>In 1912 schilderde Monet een serie van 12 waterlelie schilderijen in opdracht van de Orangerie des Tuileries, een museum in Parijs. Hij koos ervoor om ze op zeer grote schaal te maken, en om te dienen als een "haven van vreedzame meditatie". Dit project verbruikte veel van Monet's latere jaren. Monet verklaarde eens: "Deze landschappen van water en reflectie zijn voor mij een obsessie geworden. Het is buiten mijn kracht als een oude man, en toch wil ik geven wat ik voel."<br/><br/>Zijn gezondheid was nu ook een obstakel. Bijna blind, met beide ogen ernstig aangetast door cataracten, Monet uiteindelijk ingestemd met een operatie voor de ziekte in 1923.<br/><br/>Monet's beroemde waterlelies werd rooder naarmate zijn staar vorderde. Nadat hij een corrigerende operatie had ondergaan, vernietigde hij de meeste van de "rode lelie" -schilderijen, boos dat niemand het hem echt vertelde. Ironisch genoeg waren deze schilderijen waarschijnlijk wat zijn impressionistische stijl in die tijd zo beroemd maakte - kunstenaars begonnen meer risico's te nemen met kleur en dergelijke tijdens dit punt.<br/><br/>Het meesterwerk<br/><br/>"De jongen die achter je zit zegt dat je eruit ziet als een meesterwerk.<br/><br/>Vraag hem, heeft hij ooit een Monet van dichtbij gezien?<br/><br/>Dicht genoeg om niets anders te zien dan verwarde vlekken van onkruidige oevers van het meer?<br/><br/>Dicht genoeg om zijn vingers in de kammen te dompelen<br/><br/>waar olieverf verhardt onder de blik van een kunstenaar?<br/><br/>Dicht genoeg om op de bloedlelies te ademen?<br/><br/>Vraag hem, waarom heeft hij ze rood geverfd?” (Andriealphus)<br/><br/>Hij grinnikte als Carroll's cheshire kat.<br/><br/>"Door vertroebelde en bloederige ogen stel ik me voor.<br/><br/>Wees mijn waterlelies!" zegt hij,<br/><br/>"Voel mijn adem en laat mijn vingers duiken,<br/><br/>Word in plaats daarvan mijn meesterwerk.<br/><br/>Een borstel heeft nog nooit een canvas zo fijn aangeraakt als je mooie huid.<br/><br/>Laat de meesters huilen in jaloezie,<br/><br/>En Van Gogh snijdt zijn oor in afgunst op de schoonheid van je naaktheid.<br/><br/>Zelfportret met bandage oor<br/><br/>Vincent van Gogh [Public domain], via Wikimedia Commons<br/><br/>Beantwoorden<br/><br/>Nu is het jouw beurt.

Ik kijk er echt naar uit om hieraan toe te voegen.<br/><br/>Ik wilde eerst even stilstaan en je dat laten weten.<br/><br/>En heel erg bedankt voor alle uitdagingen om de rest van ons te helpen, onze mentale energie te laten stromen en het uit te laten werken!

Je bent een geschenk!<br/><br/>Knuffels. :-)<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) uit Gondwana Land op 12 augustus 2015:<br/><br/>Hallo weer Marj. Ik denk dat ik misschien alle verzen heb die komen gaan. Ik heb mijn best gedaan om ze te regelen zoals ik denk dat ze het beste zijn met slechts een beetje bewerking. Ik zal waarschijnlijk het voltooide gedicht plaatsen als een aparte hub met een link hierop. Mijn boek is beschikbaar op Lulu en iBooks... er is een link op een van de eerdere opmerkingen. Ik zou het echt waarderen als je een exemplaar zou purhazen. Houd in gedachten dat het mijn eerste eBook is, dus de opmaak etc is niet perfect, maar het heeft me zeven revisies genomen denk ik om het te krijgen waar het is. Het zal allemaal gemakkelijker de volgende keer. Als je hulp nodig hebt laat het me weten.<br/><br/>travmaj uit australië op 12 augustus 2015:<br/><br/>Hoi John, je hebt zeker een aantal uitstekende reacties gehad op je uitdaging - ik ben er zeker van dat je het helemaal mooi zult smelten, hoewel ik me een moeilijke taak voorstel. Ik ben ook geïnteresseerd in uw gedichtenboeken - ik moet echt mijn act technologisch bij elkaar krijgen - ik zal proberen om het allemaal uit te checken... cheers -<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) uit Gondwana Land op 11 augustus 2015:<br/><br/>Hi Jo, beide boeken 'On the Wings of Eagles' en "I Laughed a Smile" hebben meestal dezelfde inhoud... behalve het eerste heeft een extra gedicht. Oorspronkelijk waren ze in verschillende formaten, de ene ePub, de andere PDF maar nu zijn ze beide ePub. Ze zijn beschikbaar via Lulu en iBooks, binnenkort Barnes en Noble en Nook (niet Amazon). Ik kan proberen een ander boek te publiceren via Amazon binnenkort gewoon om te zien hoe het vergelijkt. Nogmaals bedankt.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues uit Lincolnshire, UK op 11 augustus 2015:<br/><br/>John, heel erg bedankt, de info over het publiceren met Lulu zal heel nuttig zijn als ik aan het publiceren denk, maar ik ben momenteel verscheurd tussen Amazon en Lulu. Ik wilde een van je boeken kopen, maar ik kon ze niet lijken te vinden op Amazon. Maar ik zal het waarschijnlijk van Lulu krijgen, en ik wens je veel succes, je verdient het.<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) uit Gondwana Land op 11 augustus 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, bedankt voor het bijdragen. Ik vind het leuk, een perfect einde aan het gedicht dat ik denk.<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) uit Gondwana Land op 11 augustus 2015:<br/><br/>Bedankt, Faith.<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) uit Gondwana Land op 11 augustus 2015:<br/><br/>Hallo Jo, ik denk dat ik het gedicht bevredigend heb gesorteerd. Gewoon wachten om te zien of er nog meer toe te voegen is. Publiceren met Lulu was niet slecht en nu ik het eenmaal heb gedaan, zal het de volgende keer gemakkelijker zijn. Het krijgen van de opmaak om goed te kijken in het eBook was de moeilijkste, hoewel u en typ het gewoon in een woorddocument en Lulu automatisch produceert de inhoudspagina en converteert het document naar ePub of PDF kunt u alleen bepaalde lettertypen gebruiken en moet ervoor zorgen dat de hoofdstuknamen of gedicht titels zijn in Hoofdstuk 1. Ze bieden ook een gratis ISBN-nummer als je wilt. Over het algemeen was het echter gemakkelijker dan verwacht.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues uit Lincolnshire, UK op 11 augustus 2015:<br/><br/>Phyllis, dit is beknopt en mooi, ik vind het geweldig. Shyron's deed ook uitstekend werk, ik dacht dat ik al commentaar had op haar vers, maar ik had het niet gedaan.<br/><br/>Phyllis Doyle brandt uit de Hoge woestijn van Nevada. op 10 augustus 2015:<br/><br/>Prachtige hub, geweldig idee, Jodah.

John, kijken uit naar het lezen van het eindresultaat.<br/><br/>Trouwens, congtats op het publiceren van uw gedichten. Hoe vond je het proces van het publiceren met Lulu?<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) uit Gondwana Land op 10 augustus 2015:<br/><br/>Nee, het is niet te laat, ik ben nog steeds het laatste gedicht aan het samenstellen, dus het zou voor iedereen in een dag of twee moeten zijn om te zien.<br/><br/>Faith Reaper uit het zuiden van de VS op 10 augustus 2015:<br/><br/>Hallo, John.<br/><br/>Ik verontschuldig me voor mijn late voorlegging hier aan uw prachtige uitdaging. Ik ben een paar dagen van het werk af en heb besloten om dit eens te laten gaan terwijl mijn man rust van kniechirurgie. Als het niet voldoet aan uw normen, aarzel dan niet om het te gebruiken in uw laatste gedicht of te bewerken als u het nodig acht.<br/><br/>Zegeningen altijd<br/><br/>Hier gaat het:<br/><br/>Bekentenissen aan vriend Georges Clemenceau<br/><br/>Van licht dat beide kwelling, vreugde inkapselt<br/><br/>Vurige waanzin bij het analyseren van kleuren<br/><br/>Consequentiële spontane creaties<br/><br/>Seizoen na seizoen van obsessie<br/><br/>Verschillende tinten in één moment vastleggen<br/><br/>Attent tijdens een wandeling in Argenteuill<br/><br/>Borstelwerk bars meesterwerk.<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) uit Gondwana Land op 09 augustus 2015:<br/><br/>Gewoon een schreeuw om te zien of iemand anders nog wil bijdragen aan dit kettinggedicht. Ik ben begonnen met het samenstellen van de stanzas, maar zal het nog een paar dagen open laten voor het geval iemand anders van plan is om mee te doen. Bedankt aan iedereen die heeft bijgedragen.<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) uit Gondwana Land op 02 augustus 2015:<br/><br/>Dank u Genna. Het lijkt Monet is een favoriete lijst van velen hier. Ik hoop dat je deelneemt aan deze uitdaging ook :)<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) uit Gondwana Land op 02 augustus 2015:<br/><br/>Bedankt voor een geweldige bijdrage Shyron. Dit is een heel mooi vers. Goed gedaan.<br/><br/>Genna East uit Massachusetts, USA op 02 augustus 2015:<br/><br/>Hallo, John.<br/><br/>Ik begon deze prachtige uitdaging te lezen (Monet is een van mijn favoriete artiesten), toen kwam ik terug om een aantal van de prachtige bijdragen te lezen die dit schilderij een prachtige stem geven door perceptie en de zintuigen.

Ik ben zo blij dat je mijn bijdrage leuk vindt. Dit is een heel goed idee, ik weet dat je het leuk zult vinden om het allemaal samen te stellen. Zorg goed voor jezelf en mijn beste voor je.<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) uit Gondwana Land op 01 augustus 2015:<br/><br/>Bedankt Deb, ja, ik ben onder de indruk van de standaard van inzendingen. Ik kijk ernaar uit om het allemaal samen te stellen.<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) uit Gondwana Land op 01 augustus 2015:<br/><br/>Ja Ann, het is goed om te zien dat de dichters onder ons de uitdaging aangaan met een aantal grote bijdragen tot nu toe. Ik hoop alleen dat Imcan het recht doet als het gaat om het samenstellen.<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) uit Gondwana Land op 01 augustus 2015:<br/><br/>Goed gedaan Jo. Het woord "sublime" komt in gedachten. Ik hoopte dat alle dichters naar voren zouden komen, en ze hebben het. Love it, bedankt voor het bijdragen.<br/><br/>Deb Hirt uit Stillwater, OK op 01 augustus 2015:<br/><br/>Ik ben blij om te zien waar je mee eindigt. Er zijn een aantal fijne dichters die opstaan voor de uitdaging, dus ga er naartoe!<br/><br/>Ann Carr uit SW England op 01 augustus 2015:<br/><br/>Geweldig, Jo!<br/><br/>In plaats van mij, zet je dit allemaal samen, maar het wordt een humdinger van een gedicht als het eindelijk ten einde komt - als het ooit eindigt! Je bent echt iets begonnen.<br/><br/>Ann<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues uit Lincolnshire, UK op 01 augustus 2015:<br/><br/>Oké, John hier gaat niets! Na Kim's. Ik hoop dat het goed leest.<br/><br/>En de jongen begon weg te lopen<br/><br/>Maar in zijn kielzog hoorde ik hem zeggen:<br/><br/>"Ik maakte een reis naar Orangerie<br/><br/>Waar de geest van Monet nog steeds blijft<br/><br/>Ik ging rechtop zitten en keek een tijdje<br/><br/>Tot ik een zachte stem hoorde schreeuwen.<br/><br/>"Heb je ooit een vloeiende droom gezien?<br/><br/>Waar licht evolueert in wat het aanraakt<br/><br/>Waar sereniteit door een bewolkte sluier stroomt<br/><br/>Waar het penseel van de tovenaar als bliksemstoot<br/><br/>Heb je ooit een subliem zicht gezien?<br/><br/>Een kind geboren uit een vervormde illusie<br/><br/>Deze bloeiende vijver die het licht vangt<br/><br/>Dat het hart opheft en de ziel wenkt<br/><br/>Een abstracte pulchritude van dichtbij<br/><br/>Ga terug, zie, zo’n stille vreugde.”<br/><br/>Ik hoop dat dit in lijn is met wat de anderen hebben gedaan. Voel je vrij om te bewerken als dat nodig is. Mijn beste...<br/><br/>- Jo.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues uit Lincolnshire, UK op 01 augustus 2015:<br/><br/>Oké, oké.<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) uit Gondwana Land op 01 augustus 2015:<br/><br/>Ja Jo, doe het alsjeblieft. Iedereen is welkom om meer dan één stanza te doen. Ik kan op een gegeven moment een andere toevoegen.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues uit Lincolnshire, UK op 01 augustus 2015:<br/><br/>John, ik heb besloten om te gaan, maar het is ongeveer 16 regels, kan ik het doen in twee stanzas na Kim's prachtige inzending? Je kunt het altijd later bewerken.<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) uit Gondwana Land op 31 juli 2015:<br/><br/>Hallo Jo, sorry om te horen dat je op dit moment onder het weer bent. Ik ben niet in een haast om deze uitdaging te sluiten, dus ik zal het open houden totdat je terug op alle cilinders schiet en in staat bent om bij te dragen. Je bent een van de hubbers waar ik naar uitkeek om een reactie te krijgen van zoals ik dacht dat het zou passen. Bedankt voor je vriendelijke woorden, en snel gezond worden.<br/><br/>Jo Alexis-Hagues uit Lincolnshire, UK op 31 juli 2015:<br/><br/>Wow! John Ik kan niet geloven dat ik je ongelooflijke uitdaging bijna heb gemist. Dit is iets waar ik graag aan had willen deelnemen, omdat Claude Monet een van mijn favoriete artiesten is. Helaas moet ik huilen. Ik ben een beetje onder het weer met een kop vol katoenwol, of zo lijkt het. Als de uitdaging nog steeds open is als ik van deze vervelende griep afkom, kan ik het eens proberen, maar ik moet zeggen, de standaard is uitzonderlijk hoog. Maj nam het naar een ander niveau, maar alle inzendingen zijn briljant. Kudos aan u Andriealphus en de andere schrijvers die tot nu toe hebben deelgenomen aan dit artistieke en creatieve meesterwerk.<br/><br/>Mijn beste altijd Jo.<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) uit Gondwana Land op 31 juli 2015:<br/><br/>Hallo weer Maj, blij dat dit gedicht je inspireerde, en ja het slaat het kijken naar de cricket vooral met de Aussie batsmen slecht presteren in deze derde test. Het zal een interessante oefening voor mij om alle stanzas samen te smelten, maar moet goed zijn.<br/><br/>travmaj uit Australië op 30 juli 2015:<br/><br/>John, dank je, ik ben het meest blij dat je mijn aanbod. Ik vond het gedicht intrigerend en plotseling voelde me geïnspireerd om mijn versie te schrijven in dezelfde modus. Ik weet niet zeker of ik een vervolg van de stanza eerder schreef (altijd verkennend), maar ik weet zeker dat je het helemaal zal smelten wanneer de tijd komt. Love alle reacties. Ik heb nog geen creatief schrijven voor yonks, kan niet wachten om nu opnieuw te beginnen, heb gewoon wat tijd nodig. (beats watching the cricket too!!!) Cheers John, zal inchecken -<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) uit Gondwana Land op 30 juli 2015:<br/><br/>Bedankt voor het controleren van Dana. Ik ben blij met de kwaliteit van de reacties tot nu toe. Ik moet gewoon wachten en zien hoeveel meer er binnenkomen. De finale, gedicht zou geweldig moeten zijn.<br/><br/>Dana Tate uit LOS ANGELES op 30 juli 2015:<br/><br/>Gewoon inchecken om te zien hoe het gaat, ik kan niet wachten op het afgewerkte product. Ik woonde een poëzieles bij en we deden dit ook, het was echt leuk.<br/><br/>ocfireflies uit North Carolina op 29 juli 2015:<br/><br/>John.<br/><br/>Dank je wel voor het bieden van het platform voor zonder dat het gemakkelijk is om naar beneden te vallen.<br/><br/>; ) Kim<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) uit Gondwana Land op 29 juli 2015:<br/><br/>Dank je Devika, ik heb je al een tijdje niet meer gezien, ik hoop dat alles in orde is.<br/><br/>John Hansen (auteur) uit Gondwana Land op 29 juli 2015:<br/><br/>Mooi werk Kim.

| First of all EEQT itself needs to be further developed in order to provide a theoretical and computational answer to the needs of modern quantum engineering<br/>and technology. We need to include classical systems with infinite<br/>numbers of degrees of freedom - like electromagnetic and/or gravitational<br/>field. We also need to include infinite quantum systems so as<br/>to understand and simulate Bose gas and its phase transitions. But, there<br/>are also steps that must be taken far beyond the paradigm of EEQT.<br/>As we have emphasized so many times: quantum theory has yet<br/>to be understood in terms of a "non-linear classical theory." But what we mean by a "classical theory" is something much more advanced and more<br/>general than clasical mechanics or classical field theory. By a "classical theory" we mean first of all, a theory that is not based<br/>on probabilities from the start; a theory in which probabilities appear at a<br/>later stage, derived from the theory; derived perhaps, in a necessary way. Such a theory must not only specify the mathematical objects and their relations but also make "predictions".<br/>A classical theory is, in particular, a theory in which discrete events can happen, events that are "objective." They may be events that affect mainly the physical stratum, but they may be also "mental<br/>events," changes of states of "consciousness;" whatever they are, even if they<br/>are concerned with branchings of universes, - they DO HAPPEN.<br/>Such a theory, encompassing the quantum theory as we know it today,<br/>does not yet exist, but we can envisage its possible shape. Nothing serves better than an example, so let us give here an example of how<br/>such a theory can be construed.<br/>Imagine a theory developed a'la Einstein's unified field theory, but<br/>with variable metric signature, possibly with a complex causal web, multiple<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (see also [41]) bridges,<br/>time loops, nondifferrentiability, fractal structure, all of that additionally complicated by variable dimensionality of space and of "time" (cf [42]. Imagine such a theory to be able to accomodate all the four fundamental<br/>forces known to us, but it also involves an extra field, which is different<br/>from physical fields, and which is non-local in the sense that it does not<br/>survive taking a macro-average-limit when causal space-time<br/>structure of Einstein's general relativity is recovered. This extra field<br/>would be a place for "thought forms" and our theory would couple these<br/>thought forms to more "physical" levels of reality. The very concept of<br/>"time" would arise only in one particular limiting structure. Nothing<br/>prevents a theory of such a type to have mathematical structures rich enough to accomodate consciousness and mind. Due to its complexity,<br/>density of time-loops, bubble-like causal structure, making predictions<br/>in such theory is possible only by applying probability -<br/>as it is the case with systems evolving according to deterministic<br/>but chaotic dynamics. Quantum wave function would emerge in such a<br/>theory as an effective way of predicting. That type of explanation<br/>of quantum indeterminism was postulated long ago by I. J. Good. In<br/>[3] he speculated that<br/>quantum indeterminism can be understood if we admit that individual quantum events that actually happen here and now have future<br/>advanced causes as well has past retarded causes.<br/>A glimpse of such a thought<br/>may have occured to Alan Turing when he wrote his famous, already quoted sentence: "prediction must be linear, description must be nonlinear."<br/>A theory going partially in this direction is being developed by L. Nottale<br/>[43] who states the observation, attributed to Feynman, that "the typical paths of quantum mechanical particles are continuous non-differentiable." Then he continues his development of fractal<br/>space-time ideas to conclude with: "The quantum behavior becomes, in this theory,<br/>a manifestation of the fractal geometry of space-time, in the same way gravitation is, in Einstein's theory of general (motion-)relativity, a manifestation of the curvature of space-time.<br/>Another step in this direction comes from the work of Russian scientists - which started with the most original ideas of N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>and A. Sakharov [45], and is being developed in Moscow, the Urals and Siberia, see e.g. [46, 47, 48]. | Allereerst moet EEQT zelf verder worden ontwikkeld om een theoretisch en computationeel antwoord te bieden op de behoeften van moderne kwantumtechniek en -technologie. We moeten klassieke systemen met oneindig veel vrijheidsgraden opnemen, zoals elektromagnetisch en/of zwaartekrachtsveld. We moeten ook oneindige kwantumsystemen opnemen om Bose-gas en zijn faseovergangen te begrijpen en te simuleren. Maar er zijn ook stappen die ver buiten het paradigma van EEQT moeten worden genomen.<br/>Zoals we zo vaak hebben benadrukt: kwantumtheorie moet nog worden begrepen in termen van een "niet-lineaire klassieke theorie." Maar wat we bedoelen met een ‘klassieke theorie’ is iets veel geavanceerder en algemener dan de klassieke mechanica of de klassieke veldtheorie. Met een ‘klassieke theorie’ bedoelen we in de eerste plaats een theorie die niet vanaf het begin op waarschijnlijkheden is gebaseerd; een theorie waarin waarschijnlijkheden in een later stadium verschijnen, afgeleid van de theorie; misschien op een noodzakelijke manier afgeleid. Een dergelijke theorie moet niet alleen de wiskundige objecten en hun relaties specificeren, maar ook "voorspellingen" doen.<br/>Een klassieke theorie is in het bijzonder een theorie waarin discrete gebeurtenissen kunnen plaatsvinden, gebeurtenissen die "objectief" zijn. Het kunnen gebeurtenissen zijn die voornamelijk de fysische stratum beïnvloeden, maar het kunnen ook ‘geestelijke gebeurtenissen’ zijn, veranderingen in staten van ‘bewustzijn’; wat ze ook zijn, zelfs als ze betrekking hebben op vertakkingen van universa – ze GEBEUREN.<br/>Een dergelijke theorie, die de kwantumtheorie omvat zoals we die vandaag kennen, bestaat nog niet, maar we kunnen de mogelijke vorm ervan bedenken. Niets dient beter dan een voorbeeld, dus laten we hier een voorbeeld geven van hoe een dergelijke theorie kan worden geïnterpreteerd.<br/>Stelt u zich een theorie voor die Einstein's verenigde veldtheorie ontwikkelde, maar met variabele metrische handtekening, mogelijk met een complex causaal web, veelvoudige<br/>Einstein-Rosen [40] (zie ook [41]) bruggen, tijdlussen, niet-differentiabiliteit, fractale structuur, dit alles bovendien gecompliceerd door variabele dimensionaliteit van de ruimte en van "tijd" (cf [42]. Stel je een dergelijke theorie voor om alle vier de fundamentele krachten die ons bekend zijn, te kunnen accommoderen, maar het omvat ook een extra veld, dat anders is dan fysieke velden, en dat niet lokaal is in de zin dat het niet overleeft het nemen van een macro-gemiddelde limiet wanneer de causale ruimte-tijdstructuur van Einstein's algemene relativiteit wordt hersteld. Dit extra veld zou een plaats zijn voor "gedachtenvormen" en onze theorie zou deze gedachtevormen koppelen aan meer "fysieke" niveaus van werkelijkheid.<br/>"tijd" zou slechts in een bepaalde beperkende structuur ontstaan. Niets belet een theorie van dit type om wiskundige structuren rijk genoeg te hebben om bewustzijn en geest te accommoderen. Vanwege de complexiteit, dichtheid van tijdlussen, bubbel-achtige causale structuur, het maken van voorspellingen in een dergelijke theorie is alleen mogelijk door het toepassen van waarschijnlijkheid -<br/>zoals het geval is met systemen die evolueren volgens deterministische maar chaotische dynamiek. De kwantumgolffunctie zou in zo'n theorie naar voren komen als een effectieve manier om te voorspellen. Dat soort verklaring van kwantumindeterminisme werd lang geleden gepostuleerd door I. J. Good. In<br/>Hij speculeerde dat kwantumindeterminisme kan worden begrepen als we toegeven dat individuele kwantumgebeurtenissen die hier daadwerkelijk plaatsvinden en nu toekomstige geavanceerde oorzaken hebben, ook vertraagde oorzaken hebben.<br/>Een glimp van een dergelijke gedachte kan voor Alan Turing zijn opgekomen toen hij zijn beroemde, reeds geciteerde zin schreef: "voorspelling moet lineair zijn, beschrijving moet niet-lineair zijn."<br/>Een theorie die gedeeltelijk in deze richting gaat, wordt ontwikkeld door L. Nottale.<br/>[43] die stelt de observatie, toegeschreven aan Feynman, dat "de typische paden van kwantum mechanische deeltjes zijn continu niet-differentiabel." Vervolgens vervolgt hij zijn ontwikkeling van fractale ruimte-tijd-ideeën om af te sluiten met: "Het kwantumgedrag wordt in deze theorie een manifestatie van de fractale geometrie van de ruimte-tijd, op dezelfde manier is de zwaartekracht in Einsteins theorie van de algemene (bewegings-)relativiteit een manifestatie van de kromming van de ruimte-tijd.<br/>Een andere stap in deze richting komt van het werk van Russische wetenschappers - die begon met de meest originele ideeën van N.A. Kozyrev [44]<br/>en A. Sacharov [45], en wordt ontwikkeld in Moskou, de Oeral en Siberië, zie bijvoorbeeld [46, 47, 48]. |
| Best Nutrition And Exercise For Lose Weight<br/><br/>How is breakfast really healthy?<br/><br/>In the morning like an emperor, at noon like a king, in the evening like a beggar – goes a well-known proverb. A study by the medical organization Endocrine Society confirms the key message behind the saying: It shows that breakfast plays a more important role than is often assumed. In the morning, the human body actually has more than twice as high a metabolic activity as at other times of the day: A large breakfast not only keeps you full for a long time, blood sugar and insulin levels also rise slowly. The appetite for sweets is regulated, we eat snacks less often during the day. Therefore, breakfast should not be skipped even during a diet.<br/><br/>Of course, having a big breakfast doesn't mean that we should have several croissants with nut nougat cream and sweet breakfast pancakes in the morning. Breakfast is healthy best when it is high in protein and fiber, as well as providing vitamins and minerals. Whole grain bread or muesli, oat flakes, fruits and nuts are energy suppliers that are good for you and keep you full for a long time.<br/><br/>The fact that a large breakfast is better than a large dinner does not necessarily mean that breakfast is essential for losing weight. A meta-analysis carried out in 2019 showed, that the total daily energy intake of people who eat breakfast is on average higher, than that of those who do not have breakfast. The latter were on average just under half a kilo lighter. So, according to the results of this major study, you don't necessarily have to eat breakfast if you want to lose weight.<br/><br/>Lose weight with the right diet – that's how easy it is to put healthy on your plate<br/><br/>Eating healthy in no way means less taste. Fresh vegetables, fish or meat as protein sources and other healthy ingredients conjure up taste in the pot and a smile on your lips – ideally also when you step on the scales. A US study has shown that people who cook their own food and consciously deal with what they eat have a body mass index in the normal range. Restaurant visits or fast food, on the other hand, quickly lure you into the sugar trap: Often there is no indication of how much sugar is in salad dressings, how much fat the potatoes were fried in or whether the meat was not treated.<br/><br/>A healthy lunch consists of three parts – the largest part is fruits or vegetables and should cover half of the plate. A quarter of the meal should consist of protein, i.e. fish, meat or tofu. The remaining quarter consists of carbohydrates and is ideally made from whole grain products. Important: Don't eat at your desk in the office, but stimulate your metabolism and ideally take a short walk before or after lunch.<br/><br/>When should you eat to lose weight?<br/><br/>In the evening, you should focus on light meals that are rather low in carbohydrates. These are the least likely to cause insulin to skyrocket, which is good for our body. Vegetables, dairy products and nuts, for example, are well suited for this.<br/><br/>You should also be careful not to have dinner too late. It is best to have eaten until 7 p.m. – then the body can relax and prepare for the night. Sufficient sleep is important for healthy weight loss. A US study found that people who slept about eight hours a night had better fat deposits. So good night! Allow yourself more than six hours of sleep so that you can start the next day fit and refreshed.<br/><br/>Losing weight without exercise – is it really possible?<br/><br/>It would be so easy, if the dream weight could be achieved simply by lowering the calorie intake. But you probably know the wisdom that diet is only one side of the coin and exercise is the other. So nothing helps: Put on your sportswear and off you go!<br/><br/>Anyone who, in addition to the sports program such as jogging, walking or swimming, also lets the elevator go alone and takes the stairs, takes a little detour or uses the bike instead of the car, is doing wellis also called something good. Even simple walking is good for health. | Beste Voeding En Oefening Voor Weight Loss<br/><br/>Hoe is het ontbijt echt gezond?<br/><br/>'s Morgens als een keizer, 's middags als een koning, 's avonds als een bedelaar - gaat een bekend spreekwoord. Een studie van de medische organisatie Endocrine Society bevestigt de sleutelboodschap achter het gezegde: Het laat zien dat het ontbijt een belangrijkere rol speelt dan vaak wordt aangenomen. In de ochtend heeft het menselijk lichaam eigenlijk meer dan twee keer zo hoge metabole activiteit als op andere momenten van de dag: een groot ontbijt houdt je niet alleen lang vol, ook de bloedsuiker- en insulinespiegels stijgen langzaam. De eetlust voor snoep wordt gereguleerd, we eten overdag minder vaak snacks. Daarom moet het ontbijt zelfs tijdens een dieet niet worden overgeslagen.<br/><br/>Natuurlijk betekent het hebben van een groot ontbijt niet dat we 's ochtends verschillende croissants met nootnootroom en zoete ontbijtpannenkoeken moeten hebben. Ontbijt is het gezondst wanneer het rijk is aan eiwitten en vezels, evenals het verstrekken van vitaminen en mineralen.Volkorenbrood of muesli, havervlokken, fruit en noten zijn energieleveranciers die goed voor je zijn en je lang vol houden.<br/><br/>Het feit dat een groot ontbijt beter is dan een groot diner betekent niet noodzakelijkerwijs dat het ontbijt essentieel is om af te vallen. Een meta-analyse uitgevoerd in 2019 toonde aan dat de totale dagelijkse energie-inname van mensen die ontbijten gemiddeld hoger is dan die van degenen die niet ontbijten. De laatste waren gemiddeld iets minder dan een half kilo lichter. Dus, volgens de resultaten van deze grote studie, je hoeft niet per se te ontbijten als je wilt afvallen.<br/><br/>Afvallen met het juiste dieet - zo gemakkelijk is het om gezond op je bord te zetten<br/><br/>Gezond eten betekent op geen enkele manier minder smaak. Verse groenten, vis of vlees als eiwitbronnen en andere gezonde ingrediënten toveren smaak in de pot en een glimlach op je lippen – idealiter ook als je op de weegschaal stapt. Een Amerikaanse studie heeft aangetoond dat mensen die hun eigen voedsel koken en bewust omgaan met wat ze eten, een body mass index hebben in het normale bereik. Restaurantbezoeken of fastfood, aan de andere kant, lokken je snel in de suikerval: Vaak is er geen indicatie van hoeveel suiker er in saladedressings zit, hoeveel vet de aardappelen werden gebakken of of het vlees niet werd behandeld.<br/><br/>Een gezonde lunch bestaat uit drie delen – het grootste deel is fruit of groenten en moet de helft van het bord bedekken. Een kwart van de maaltijd moet bestaan uit eiwitten, dat wil zeggen vis, vlees of tofu. Het resterende kwartaal bestaat uit koolhydraten en is ideaal gemaakt van volkorenproducten. Belangrijk: Eet niet aan je bureau op kantoor, maar stimuleer je stofwisseling en neem idealiter een korte wandeling voor of na de lunch.<br/><br/>Wanneer moet je eten om gewicht te verliezen?<br/><br/>'S Avonds moet je je richten op lichte maaltijden die vrij laag in koolhydraten zijn. Deze zijn het minst waarschijnlijk insuline veroorzaken om te skyrockten, wat goed is voor ons lichaam. Groenten, zuivelproducten en noten zijn hier bijvoorbeeld goed voor.<br/><br/>Je moet ook voorzichtig zijn om niet te laat te eten. Het is het beste om tot 19:00 uur te hebben gegeten – dan kan het lichaam ontspannen en zich voorbereiden op de nacht. Voldoende slaap is belangrijk voor gezond gewichtsverlies. Een Amerikaanse studie toonde aan dat mensen die ongeveer acht uur per nacht sliepen betere vetafzettingen hadden. Dus goede nacht! Sta jezelf meer dan zes uur slaap toe, zodat je de volgende dag fit en verfrist kunt beginnen.<br/><br/>Afvallen zonder lichaamsbeweging – is dat echt mogelijk?<br/><br/>Het zou zo gemakkelijk zijn, als het droomgewicht eenvoudig zou kunnen worden bereikt door de calorie-inname te verlagen. Maar je weet waarschijnlijk de wijsheid dat dieet slechts de ene kant van de munt is en lichaamsbeweging de andere is. Dus niets helpt: Trek je sportkleding aan en ga je gang!<br/><br/>Iedereen die, naast het sportprogramma zoals joggen, wandelen of zwemmen, ook de lift alleen laat gaan en de trap neemt, een omweg neemt of de fiets gebruikt in plaats van de auto, doet wellis ook wel iets goeds genoemd. Zelfs eenvoudig lopen is goed voor de gezondheid. |
| Why We Open Sourced the Anvil App Server<br/><br/>Why Open Source?<br/><br/>A little while ago, we open-sourced the Anvil App Server. The community reaction has been great, even a little overwhelming (yes, every reply to that announcement really did land in my inbox!). We've already incorporated a bunch of that feedback into our version 1.2 release. But we keep getting asked, " Why did you open-source such a core part of your product? "<br/><br/>Why do this at all?<br/><br/>Anvil is a tool that makes it as simple as possible to build a web app. We do that by enabling you to build the whole application in one language, Python.<br/><br/>Simple hosting is part of that.<br/><br/>The web platform is broken , and Anvil is our attempt to fix it. And, because there is so much complexity in deploying a web app, a cloud-hosted service was the best way to provide the simplicity we want. That way, you can build your app in the Anvil Editor, and make it live on the Internet with one click.<br/><br/>But we kept hearing from people who said, "that's great, but…"<br/><br/>"…but I need to run this on an offshore platform without reliable internet access"<br/><br/>"…but I want to package my app into an IoT device I sell"<br/><br/>or simply, "…but if I'm putting my eggs in this basket, how can I be sure I can still run my app in ten years' time?"<br/><br/>These are all good points! A cloud service isn't the right solution for everyone. If we want to serve these users, there's got to be some way for them to get their apps out of Anvil and run them locally, under their own complete control.<br/><br/>Open Source: Escape hatch, not an ejector seat<br/><br/>We believe in escape hatches, not ejector seats. At conferences, we sometimes get asked, "can I export this as a Flask+JS app?". Sure, it would be possible – we could generate a server package, compile the client-side Python to Javascript, and spit out a classic web app. But it would have serious drawbacks, because:<br/><br/>Not a comfy ride.<br/><br/>Code generation is an ejector seat. Generated code is better than nothing – at least you can edit it! But the moment you edit that code, you lose all the benefits of the system that generated it. If you're using Anvil because of its drag-and-drop editor and Python in the browser, why should our locally-hosted users have to use vim and Javascript?<br/><br/>So we did it the right way: we open-sourced Anvil's runtime engine. It's the same code that serves your app in our hosted service, and it represents your app the same way. You can edit your code with a text editor, run it, then git push it back into our online IDE. It's not an ejector seat: there's no explosive transition. It's an escape hatch: you can climb out, and climb right back in.<br/><br/>What about our business model?<br/><br/>Anvil was never meant to be one of those enterprise low-code systems that charge you $20/mo for each person who uses your app. Anvil is a developer tool. The apps you develop are yours. Enabling you to run them on a Raspberry Pi is cool, but it doesn't change our business model.<br/><br/>We're doing what we always were: We make and sell a development tool that makes it drastically simpler to build web applications. We provide hosting for Anvil apps. We offer the entire development-and-hosting platform on-site for enterprise customers. And, of course, we offer a free plan so that everyone can use Anvil for hobby or educational purposes – or to start building something and see how it goes.<br/><br/>We've open-sourced the Anvil App Server for the (relatively small) number of people who need it, and to provide the ultimate insurance policy. Sure, you can build an app with vim and host it yourself, without even registering an account with us (we've got docs to show you how!). But the Anvil Editor is the world's easiest way to build a web app, and our hosted service is the easiest way to deploy it – so that's what we expect most of our users to continue doing. And you can build with confidence, knowing that the open-source code is right there if you need it.<br/><br/>Try it yourself<br/><br/>If our development philosophy resonates with you, why not try Anvil yourself? | Waarom we de Anvil App Server hebben geopend<br/><br/>Waarom open source?<br/><br/>Een tijdje geleden hebben we de Anvil App Server open-sourced. De communityreactie was geweldig, zelfs een beetje overweldigend (ja, elk antwoord op die aankondiging kwam echt in mijn inbox terecht!). We hebben al een heleboel van die feedback opgenomen in onze versie 1.2 release. Maar we worden steeds gevraagd: "Waarom heb je zo'n kerndeel van je product open-sourced?"<br/><br/>Waarom doe je dit?<br/><br/>Anvil is een tool die het zo eenvoudig mogelijk maakt om een web-app te bouwen. We doen dat door u in staat te stellen de hele applicatie in één taal, Python, te bouwen.<br/><br/>Eenvoudige hosting maakt daar deel van uit.<br/><br/>Het webplatform is kapot , en Anvil is onze poging om het op te lossen. En omdat er zoveel complexiteit is in het implementeren van een webapp, was een cloud-gehoste service de beste manier om de eenvoud te bieden die we willen. Op die manier kunt u uw app bouwen in de Anvil Editor en deze met één klik live op het internet maken.<br/><br/>Maar we hoorden steeds weer van mensen die zeiden: "Dat is geweldig, maar..."<br/><br/>"...maar ik moet dit uitvoeren op een offshore-platform zonder betrouwbare internettoegang"<br/><br/>"...maar ik wil mijn app verpakken in een IoT-apparaat dat ik verkoop"<br/><br/>of gewoon, "...maar als ik mijn eieren in deze mand stop, hoe kan ik er dan zeker van zijn dat ik over tien jaar nog steeds mijn app kan draaien?"<br/><br/>Dit zijn allemaal goede punten! Een cloudservice is niet voor iedereen de juiste oplossing. Als we deze gebruikers willen bedienen, moet er een manier zijn voor hen om hun apps uit Anvil te halen en ze lokaal uit te voeren, onder hun eigen volledige controle.<br/><br/>Open Source: Escape luik, geen ejector stoel<br/><br/>Wij geloven in ontsnappingsluiken, niet in ejectorstoelen. Op conferenties wordt ons soms gevraagd: "Kan ik dit exporteren als een Flask+JS app?". Tuurlijk, het zou mogelijk zijn – we zouden een serverpakket kunnen genereren, de client-side Python naar Javascript kunnen compileren en een klassieke webapp uitspuwen. Maar het zou ernstige nadelen hebben, omdat:<br/><br/>Geen comfortabele rit.<br/><br/>Het genereren van code is een ejector seat. Generated code is beter dan niets – in ieder geval kunt u het bewerken! Maar het moment dat u die code bewerkt, verliest u alle voordelen van het systeem dat het heeft gegenereerd. Als je Anvil gebruikt vanwege de drag-and-drop editor en Python in de browser, waarom zouden onze lokaal gehoste gebruikers dan vim en Javascript moeten gebruiken?<br/><br/>Dus we deden het op de juiste manier: we open-sourced Anvil's runtime engine. Het is dezelfde code die uw app serveert in onze gehoste service, en het vertegenwoordigt uw app op dezelfde manier. U kunt uw code bewerken met een teksteditor, deze uitvoeren en vervolgens terug in onze online IDE duwen. Het is geen ejector seat: er is geen explosieve overgang. Het is een ontsnappingsluik: je kunt eruit klimmen, en meteen terug klimmen.<br/><br/>Hoe zit het met ons business model?<br/><br/>Anvil was nooit bedoeld als een van die enterprise low-code systemen die u $20 / mo in rekening brengen voor elke persoon die uw app gebruikt. Anvil is een ontwikkelaar tool. De apps die u ontwikkelt zijn van jou. Je in staat stellen om ze op een Raspberry Pi te draaien is cool, maar het verandert ons bedrijfsmodel niet.<br/><br/>We doen wat we altijd al waren: we maken en verkopen een ontwikkeltool die het bouwen van webapplicaties drastisch eenvoudiger maakt. We bieden hosting voor Anvil-apps. We bieden het hele ontwikkel-en-hostingplatform op locatie voor zakelijke klanten. En natuurlijk bieden we een gratis abonnement aan, zodat iedereen Anvil kan gebruiken voor hobby- of educatieve doeleinden – of om iets te gaan bouwen en te zien hoe het gaat.<br/><br/>We hebben de Anvil App Server open-sourced voor het (relatief kleine) aantal mensen dat het nodig heeft, en om de ultieme verzekering te bieden. Zeker, je kunt een app bouwen met vim en het zelf hosten, zonder zelfs een account bij ons te registreren (we hebben docs om je te laten zien hoe!). Maar de Anvil Editor is 's werelds gemakkelijkste manier om een webapp te bouwen, en onze gehoste service is de gemakkelijkste manier om het te implementeren - dus dat is wat we verwachten dat de meeste van onze gebruikers blijven doen. En je kunt met vertrouwen bouwen, wetende dat de open-source code er is als je het nodig hebt.<br/><br/>Probeer het zelf<br/><br/>Als onze ontwikkelingsfilosofie bij u resoneert, waarom probeer je Anvil dan niet zelf? |
