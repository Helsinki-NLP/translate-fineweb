| Forty-nine years ago today, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Nearly a century ago, the 15th Amendment to the Constitution stated, "The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color or previous condition of servitude." And nearly a century before that, our nation's founding fathers set in motion the great experiment of American democracy by declaring that "all men are created equal."<br/><br/>The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was a belated acknowledgment that even in America, our foundational ideals carry little weight if not protected by the rule of law. That's why Section 2 of the 15th Amendment granted Congress the "power to enforce this article by appropriate legislation."<br/><br/>And indeed, the codified language of the Voting Rights Act was able to achieve what the Reconstruction-era Congress and Thomas Jefferson could not. The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act—and the civil rights movement from which they emerged—served as the catalyst for a dramatic increase in the opportunity for black Americans to participate in the democratic process.<br/><br/>For example, only 6.7 percent of eligible black Mississippians were registered to vote as of 1962; by 1969 that figure had reached 66.5 percent. Today, Mississippi has more black elected officials than any other state.<br/><br/>The protections put in place by the Voting Rights Act were long overdue when they were passed, representative of the arduous struggle with which they were achieved. But unthinkably, these protections are now under assault, jeopardizing the progress our nation worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>Last year, in the case of Shelby County v. Holder, the U.S. Supreme Court gutted a key component of the Voting Rights Act that enabled prior federal review to ensure nondiscrimination before any new voting law went into effect.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Sadly, the response of Republican leaders has been to do nothing. Sen. Ted Cruz and Gov. Rick Perry went out of their way to praise the Supreme Court's decision. Sen. Rand Paul dismissed the continued necessity of the Voting Rights Act by noting, "We have an African-American president."<br/><br/>While the election of President Barack Obama was indeed a historic milestone, it is dangerous to think that it absolves us from remaining vigilant against the lingering consequences of our nation's past. The haste with which states have moved to enact voting restrictions is confirmation that the protections put in place by Section 4 are still necessary.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Republican governors have signed strict photo-identification restrictions into law as the solution to a virtually nonexistent problem of voter impersonation, disproportionately hurting women, young people, working families and the African-American community. It's disingenuous for Republicans like Paul to seek the votes of these communities when they believe "there's nothing wrong with" putting restrictions in place that make it harder for these constituencies to vote.<br/><br/>Republicans have also sought to restrict early-voting periods, including the Sunday before Election Day, when African-American churches have had great success with Souls to the Polls programs.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>These restrictions represent a callous effort by Republicans to make voting harder, based on narrow, short-term political calculations that Republicans can win elections by shrinking the size of the electorate.<br/><br/>Democrats have a very different mission when it comes to voting: to ensure that every eligible voter can register, that every registered voter can vote and that every vote is accurately counted.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>The Democratic National Committee's Voter Expansion Project reflects our belief that greater voter participation strengthens our nation and our democracy. We'll continue to use our unmatched institutional knowledge to protect voting rights against legislation and tactics that would attempt to suppress the vote. And because the best defense is a good offense, we're also working to expand the vote by deploying our technology and data resources to register new voters.<br/><br/>On this anniversary, one of the best ways we can honor those who struggled—and in some cases gave their very lives—for the legislation's passage is for Republicans in Congress to join Democrats in passing the Voting Rights Amendment Act to restore the promise of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat, represents Florida's 23rd Congressional District in the United States Congress. Since 2011, she has served as chair of the Democratic National Committee. Follow her on Twitter.<br/><br/>The Root aims to foster and advance conversations about issues relevant to the black Diaspora by presenting a variety of opinions from all perspectives, whether or not those opinions are shared by our editorial staff. | Negenenveertig jaar geleden ondertekende president Lyndon B. Johnson de Voting Rights Act van 1965.<br/><br/>Advertentie<br/><br/>Bijna een eeuw geleden, het 15e amendement op de Grondwet verklaarde: "Het recht van de burgers van de Verenigde Staten om te stemmen zal niet worden geweigerd of ingekort door de Verenigde Staten of door een staat wegens ras, kleur of eerdere staat van dienstbaarheid." En bijna een eeuw daarvoor hebben de grondleggers van onze natie het grote experiment van de Amerikaanse democratie in gang gezet door te verklaren dat “alle mensen gelijk zijn geschapen”.<br/><br/>De Voting Rights Act van 1965 was een vertraagde erkenning dat zelfs in Amerika onze fundamentele idealen weinig gewicht hebben als ze niet door de rechtsstaat worden beschermd. Daarom verleende Sectie 2 van het 15e Amendement het Congres de "macht om dit artikel af te dwingen door passende wetgeving."<br/><br/>En inderdaad, de gecodificeerde taal van de Voting Rights Act was in staat om te bereiken wat het Reconstruction-tijdperk Congres en Thomas Jefferson niet konden bereiken. De Civil Rights Act van 1964 en de Voting Rights Act – en de burgerrechtenbeweging waaruit ze voortkwamen – dienden als de katalysator voor een dramatische toename van de kans voor zwarte Amerikanen om deel te nemen aan het democratische proces.<br/><br/>Slechts 6,7 procent van de in aanmerking komende zwarte Mississippianen was in 1962 geregistreerd om te stemmen. In 1969 was dat cijfer 66,5 procent. Tegenwoordig heeft Mississippi meer zwarte gekozen ambtenaren dan welke andere staat dan ook.<br/><br/>De beschermingen die door de Voting Rights Act werden ingevoerd, waren al lang achterhaald toen ze werden aangenomen, als vertegenwoordiger van de zware strijd waarmee ze werden bereikt. Maar ondenkbaar, deze beschermingen worden nu aangevallen, waardoor de vooruitgang wordt bedreigd die onze natie zo hard heeft gewerkt om te bereiken.<br/><br/>Vorig jaar, in de zaak van Shelby County v. Holder, deed het Amerikaanse Hooggerechtshof een belangrijk onderdeel van de Voting Rights Act dat voorafgaande federale herziening mogelijk maakte om non-discriminatie te garanderen voordat een nieuwe stemwet in werking trad.<br/><br/>Advertentie<br/><br/>Helaas is de reactie van de Republikeinse leiders om niets te doen. Sen. Ted Cruz en Gov. Rick Perry gingen uit hun weg om de beslissing van het Hooggerechtshof te prijzen. Senator Rand Paul verwierp de voortdurende noodzaak van de Voting Rights Act door op te merken: "We hebben een Afro-Amerikaanse president."<br/><br/>Hoewel de verkiezing van president Barack Obama inderdaad een historische mijlpaal was, is het gevaarlijk om te denken dat het ons ervan weerhoudt waakzaam te blijven tegen de blijvende gevolgen van het verleden van onze natie.

| Q&A: Vatican safeguarding expert Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 June 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Image: Australian Jesuits.<br/><br/>The President of the Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University in Rome, and a member of the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, Fr Hans Zollner SJ, was in Australia in 2018 to speak to Catholic ministry leaders and survivors.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh from Jesuit Communications sat down with him during the visit to explore how the Church is responding to the abuse crisis internationally, and what can be learned from our experiences in Australia.<br/><br/>MM: This is your third trip to Australia. You've visited quite a few other countries to see how the Church is responding to abuse around the world. Can you give us some idea of what the global picture looks like?<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: My understanding, after having visited about 50 countries on five or six continents, is that the Church is really starting to move over the last couple of years on the issue of doing justice to victims, of listening to them, and doing whatever can be done in terms of safeguarding.<br/><br/>I was with the Jesuit Provincials from all over Africa at the end of April, and the President of the Jesuit Assistancy of Africa and Madagascar is very much committed and dedicated to this. He has put up a thorough action plan for formation and for introducing guidelines all over the place. It's a very considerate and very deliberate effort to do whatever can be done to be proactively engaged as Jesuits in Africa — in a continent where until a few years ago all of this was a foreign language.<br/><br/>One of the challenges of trying to develop this global approach is that you're dealing with so many cultures, and so many different understandings. How do you bring this together and try to provide training and support religious communities tackling these issues?<br/><br/>This is one of the major questions we have. I think what I can do is stimulate discussion, stimulate reflection, and prepare people as much as possible so that they can do the groundwork.<br/><br/>The Centre for Child Protection at the Gregorian University does not pretend to have the response to every question. Not only because we don't know the specific contexts — we might know a few of them, but we're talking about thousands of cultures, we're talking about hundreds of languages, we're talking about very diverse legal backgrounds. It varies even sometimes within one country, such as Australia where you have states within the Commonwealth of Australia that have different laws than other states.<br/><br/>I am somebody who tries to elicit and stimulate discussion and reflection. I'm also very happy to listen to people.<br/><br/>You mentioned the need to listen and support victims in being heard. We've obviously had the Royal Commission here in Australia, but what are some of the other ways that you've seen that the voices of victims are being supported around the world?<br/><br/>In France there is one diocese that has established what they call 'The Listening Space'. There, victims can come forward and they can express themselves. The bishop is present. It's an open space in which people who have been hurt tremendously are free at least to express what they want to ask from the Church leadership etc.<br/><br/>There are other places in the USA or in other countries where victims have been invited by dioceses, by Provinces, by the leadership of the Church, to come forward. I have to say that overall I think there is a good will, and there are more people like bishops and provincials who listen to victims than we know. But there is no one model of giving victims not only the space to express themselves and be listened to, but also to engage actively in Church development.<br/><br/>In terms of setting up spaces for support for victims, what are some of the things you've seen that could really help — and that we could be considering here in Australia?<br/><br/>One of the major points that many victims bring up is, 'Can't we have, within parish settings, within schools settings, a regular conversation going on that includes survivors of abuse as regular members of a committee, a commission, a sounding board, a feedback group or something like that?' So that this voice is not only brought in on a specific occasion, or where a person feels like he or she is at a point to be able to speak out about it, but [is heard] on a regular basis — build that voice into the system.<br/><br/>That will help all of us. It will help survivors and victims because they will feel welcome and appreciated in the specific experience, and in the specific life challenges, that they went through. Secondly it will help the community at large, because we can at least make ourselves more and more sensitive to what the concerns and specific needs of survivors are — that can also talk to the needs of young people.<br/><br/>M: We have strong groups of survivors here in Australia who have been able to support each other through that process. But what you're saying is that we need some way of supporting those groups, and supporting those people, through our own institutions as well?<br/><br/>And I think we need to be creative. It will work for one school and one parish and one diocese in one way, and for others in a different way. Because the survivors with whom I am in constant contact, they have quite similar requests, and similar experiences in regard to being welcomed in the Church or not — feeling thrown out or dismissed. But they have also among themselves quite different expectations. So I have learned that you have also to be very forthcoming in accepting the differences in what this specific group, or this specific survivor, wants, requests and needs.<br/><br/>M: Survivors talk about wanting to have their stories heard and acknowledged. We've had the Royal Commission here in Australia, which provided an independent process where victims could come forward. Is there a need for something like that in terms of a truth, justice and reconciliation process for the Church internationally?<br/><br/>H: Yes, I think there is a need for that internationally. But I think first every local church needs to do its own homework. I don't see it happening very soon that some such council or commission would be established to look into this area for the whole Church. The Church has a membership of 1.3 billion people, and is present in 190 countries, with all kinds of differences in expectations concerning psychological, spiritual and financial support.<br/><br/>There is one thing that I have come across consistently in communicating with, working with and listening to victims, and that is that they want to be listened to. So if there was the feeling that victims were constantly being listened to — in Rome and elsewhere — I think that would give a great relief to many victims.<br/><br/>I think [Pope Francis'] concern, especially with regard to your question, is that the local churches do whatever they can so that victims will be listened to in that particular country. I have a list of people who want to speak to the Holy Father directly, and physically it is impossible. I was there in 2014 to translate for two German survivors who were chosen with two Irish and two English survivors when he received the six of them at home. He took the whole morning listening to them one after the other. For each one, he was there for 40 to 45 minutes. Were he to do this for every survivor he couldn't sleep anymore.<br/><br/>His example is modelling for the whole Catholic Church the way victims and survivors are received, welcomed and listened to. I think if the bishops and the provincials in this world, in all countries, followed his example, many survivors would be really appreciative of that.<br/><br/>Archbishop Diarmud Martin was recently quoted just before the World Meeting of Families, about the Pontifical Commission, saying that it's too small as it's currently set up to achieve what it needs to achieve. What's your take on that? Does the Church need to be putting more resources into how it's overseeing those issues?<br/><br/>At the moment we are 16 members from basically all continents, and the major language groups. We represent a variety of disciplines and professions, and the purpose of the commission — as the statutes that have just been promulgated state — is to provide counsel to the Holy Father.<br/><br/>A common misunderstanding about the commission is first that we deal with cases of allegations. That is not the case. We have no juridical or administrative power in regards to cases, because when it comes to allegations of abuse the tribunals and procedure are set.<br/><br/>A second misunderstanding is that we promote, directly, things on the ground. Our first and foremost goal is that we advise the Holy Father on issues.<br/><br/>So from my point of view, yes, we need to invest more. But we need to invest more on the local level, and we need to make sure that the proposals from the Pontifical Commission are forwarded to the Holy Father — which normally the President does — and then there is a follow-up process that reflects what we have given as our advice.<br/><br/>In Australia, Catholic Professional Standards Limited is overseeing the Church's response and providing guidelines and support for ensuring all the institutions in the Church are child-safe institutions. Is there a need for some kind of organisational support from Rome for those bishops and dioceses that are struggling to form these institutions and provide safeguarding in those dioceses?<br/><br/>I think ultimately the commission will develop in that line. They are now in the process of hiring experts in those areas.<br/><br/>I think the Church needs to understand that the local churches can learn from each other mutually. And my understanding has always been — and I think the Holy Father has reminded us — that the Church will not function as a centralised company. It does not work like that, effectively. Every bishop, every bishops conference, has, to some extent, its life on its own. What we need to learn more is to open channels of mutual communication.<br/><br/>There are a number of things that people blame for abuse in the Church. As a priest and a psychologist, and as someone who has met and worked with survivors, what are your thoughts on that issue?<br/><br/>I think the question of where does abuse come from is the most important one, and the Pope has addressed that in his letter to the people of God published on 20 August. He says in the first paragraph, and repeats it over and over again, that the question of sexual abuse is always linked — or almost always linked — not only to the question of abuse of power, but also to the abuse of conscience.<br/><br/>So the real fundamental question of abuse is much more complex than just [the question of] sexuality — be it heterosexual or homosexual. It's a power issue, and there we have to really work on the question of how do we understand priesthood, how to we understand bishophood, how do we understand and live out our ministries? What are the boundaries?<br/><br/>That's why I'm very happy that the Jesuit Province in Australia is establishing a Code of Conduct. Because we don't talk only about sexual abuse of minors. We talk about sexual abuse of adults, and we talk about abuse in other ways — like abuse of conscience, where you dictate to someone what you think, or you pretend to know by God, and you can tell another person, 'You need to do that', against the conscience of that person.<br/><br/>Many people think celibacy produces abuse. As I always say, celibacy as such is not cause for abusing — otherwise how do we explain that 99.9 per cent of all abusers do not live a celibate life, and how do we explain that 95 or 96 per cent of all priests do not abuse minors? But, celibacy, or a vow of chastity, that is not really integrated, that is not really lived out properly — yes, that produces a problem. Sometimes people take to drinking, sometime they take to gambling, and sometimes they take to sexual misconduct, with adults and with minors.<br/><br/>The real question about this is how do we deal with the notion of religious spiritual power with which priests and bishops are invested? How can theology help us to understand, and maybe how can sociology, psychology, or business administration help us to define the limits of power, and the necessity of keeping your boundaries | V&A: Vaticaanbeschermingsdeskundige Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>13 juni 2021<br/><br/>Fr Hans Zollner SJ. Afbeelding: Australische jezuïeten.<br/><br/>De voorzitter van het Centrum voor Kinderbescherming aan de Gregoriaanse Universiteit in Rome en een lid van de Pauselijke Commissie voor de Bescherming van Minderjarigen, Fr. Hans Zollner SJ, was in 2018 in Australië om te spreken met katholieke ministerieleiders en overlevenden.<br/><br/>Michael McVeigh van Jesuit Communications ging tijdens het bezoek met hem zitten om te onderzoeken hoe de Kerk internationaal reageert op de misbruikcrisis en wat er kan worden geleerd uit onze ervaringen in Australië.<br/><br/>MM: Dit is je derde reis naar Australië. Je hebt heel wat andere landen bezocht om te zien hoe de Kerk reageert op misbruik over de hele wereld. Kun je ons een idee geven van hoe het wereldbeeld eruit ziet?<br/><br/>de heer Hans Zollner SJ<br/><br/>HZ: Mijn begrip, na ongeveer 50 landen op vijf of zes continenten te hebben bezocht, is dat de Kerk de afgelopen jaren echt begint te bewegen over het recht doen aan de slachtoffers, naar hen te luisteren en alles te doen wat kan worden gedaan in termen van bescherming.<br/><br/>Eind april was ik bij de jezuïetenprovincialen uit heel Afrika en de voorzitter van de jezuïetenassistentie van Afrika en Madagaskar is hier zeer toegewijd aan. Hij heeft een gedegen actieplan opgesteld voor opleiding en voor de invoering van richtlijnen overal ter wereld. Het is een zeer attente en zeer opzettelijke inspanning om alles te doen wat kan worden gedaan om proactief betrokken te zijn als jezuïeten in Afrika - in een continent waar dit tot een paar jaar geleden allemaal een vreemde taal was.<br/><br/>Een van de uitdagingen van het proberen om deze wereldwijde aanpak te ontwikkelen is dat je te maken hebt met zoveel culturen en zoveel verschillende begrippen. Hoe brengt u dit samen en probeert u religieuze gemeenschappen op te leiden en te ondersteunen bij het aanpakken van deze problemen?<br/><br/>Dit is een van de belangrijkste vragen die we hebben. Ik denk dat ik de discussie kan stimuleren, de reflectie kan stimuleren en mensen zoveel mogelijk kan voorbereiden zodat ze de basis kunnen leggen.<br/><br/>Het Centrum voor Kinderbescherming van de Gregoriaanse Universiteit doet niet alsof het antwoord op elke vraag heeft. Niet alleen omdat we de specifieke contexten niet kennen - we kennen er misschien een paar, maar we hebben het over duizenden culturen, we hebben het over honderden talen, we hebben het over zeer uiteenlopende juridische achtergronden. Het verschilt zelfs soms binnen een land, zoals Australië waar u staten binnen het Gemenebest van Australië die andere wetten dan andere staten hebben.<br/><br/>Ik ben iemand die probeert discussie en reflectie op te wekken en te stimuleren. Ik ben ook erg blij om naar mensen te luisteren.<br/><br/>We hebben duidelijk de Koninklijke Commissie hier in Australië gehad, maar wat zijn enkele andere manieren waarop je hebt gezien dat de stemmen van slachtoffers over de hele wereld worden gesteund?<br/><br/>In Frankrijk is er één bisdom dat heeft opgericht wat zij 'The Listening Space' noemen. Daar kunnen slachtoffers naar voren komen en zich uiten. De bisschop is aanwezig. Het is een open ruimte waarin mensen die enorm gewond zijn geraakt, op zijn minst vrij zijn om uit te drukken wat ze willen vragen van de kerkleiding enz.<br/><br/>Er zijn andere plaatsen in de Verenigde Staten of in andere landen waar slachtoffers zijn uitgenodigd door diocesen, door provincies, door het leiderschap van de Kerk, om naar voren te komen. Ik moet zeggen dat over het algemeen denk ik dat er een goede wil is, en er zijn meer mensen zoals bisschoppen en provincialen die naar slachtoffers luisteren dan we weten. Maar er is geen enkel model om slachtoffers niet alleen de ruimte te geven om zich uit te drukken en naar hen te luisteren, maar ook om actief deel te nemen aan de ontwikkeling van de Kerk.<br/><br/>Wat zijn enkele van de dingen die je hebt gezien die echt kunnen helpen - en die we hier in Australië zouden kunnen overwegen?<br/><br/>Een van de belangrijkste punten die veel slachtoffers naar voren brengen, is: 'Kunnen we niet, binnen parochieinstellingen, binnen scholeninstellingen, een regelmatig gesprek voeren dat overlevenden van misbruik omvat als regelmatige leden van een commissie, een commissie, een klankbord, een feedbackgroep of iets dergelijks?' Zodat deze stem niet alleen bij een specifieke gelegenheid wordt binnengebracht, of waar een persoon het gevoel heeft dat hij of zij zich op een punt bevindt om erover te kunnen spreken, maar [wordt gehoord] op een regelmatige basis - bouw die stem in het systeem.<br/><br/>Dat zal ons allemaal helpen. Het zal overlevenden en slachtoffers helpen omdat ze zich welkom voelen en gewaardeerd in de specifieke ervaring en in de specifieke levensuitdagingen die ze hebben doorgemaakt. Ten tweede zal het de gemeenschap in het algemeen helpen, want we kunnen ons op zijn minst meer en meer bewust maken van wat de zorgen en de specifieke behoeften van de overlevenden zijn - die ook kunnen spreken over de behoeften van jongeren.<br/><br/>M: We hebben sterke groepen overlevenden hier in Australië die elkaar door dit proces hebben kunnen ondersteunen. Maar wat je zegt is dat we een manier nodig hebben om die groepen te ondersteunen, en die mensen te ondersteunen, ook via onze eigen instellingen?<br/><br/>En ik denk dat we creatief moeten zijn. Het zal werken voor een school en een parochie en een bisdom op de ene manier, en voor anderen op de andere manier. Omdat de overlevenden met wie ik in constant contact sta, heel vergelijkbare verzoeken en soortgelijke ervaringen hebben met betrekking tot het al dan niet ontvangen worden in de Kerk – het gevoel weggegooid of afgewezen te worden. Maar ze hebben ook heel andere verwachtingen onder elkaar, dus ik heb geleerd dat je ook heel snel de verschillen moet accepteren in wat deze specifieke groep, of deze specifieke overlevende, wil, vraagt en nodig heeft.<br/><br/>M: Overlevenden praten over het willen hebben van hun verhalen gehoord en erkend. We hebben de Koninklijke Commissie hier in Australië gehad, die een onafhankelijk proces bood waar slachtoffers naar voren konden komen. Is zoiets nodig in termen van een proces van waarheid, rechtvaardigheid en verzoening voor de Kerk op internationaal niveau?<br/><br/>H: Ja, ik denk dat dat internationaal nodig is, maar ik denk dat elke lokale kerk eerst haar eigen huiswerk moet doen. Ik zie het niet snel gebeuren dat een dergelijke raad of commissie zou worden opgericht om dit gebied voor de hele Kerk te onderzoeken. De Kerk heeft een lidmaatschap van 1,3 miljard mensen en is aanwezig in 190 landen, met allerlei verschillen in verwachtingen met betrekking tot psychologische, spirituele en financiële ondersteuning.<br/><br/>Er is één ding dat ik consequent tegenkom in het communiceren met, werken met en luisteren naar slachtoffers, en dat is dat ze willen worden gehoord. Als er dus het gevoel zou zijn dat er voortdurend naar slachtoffers werd geluisterd - in Rome en elders - dan denk ik dat dat veel slachtoffers een grote opluchting zou geven.<br/><br/>Ik denk dat de bezorgdheid van paus Franciscus, vooral met betrekking tot uw vraag, is dat de plaatselijke kerken alles doen wat ze kunnen om ervoor te zorgen dat de slachtoffers in dat specifieke land worden gehoord. Ik heb een lijst met mensen die rechtstreeks met de Heilige Vader willen spreken, en fysiek is het onmogelijk. Ik was er in 2014 om te vertalen voor twee Duitse overlevenden die met twee Ieren en twee Engelse overlevenden werden gekozen toen hij de zes van hen thuis ontving. Hij nam de hele ochtend om naar hen te luisteren, de een na de ander. Voor iedereen was hij er 40 tot 45 minuten, als hij dit zou doen voor elke overlevende die hij niet meer kon slapen.<br/><br/>Zijn voorbeeld is het model voor de hele katholieke kerk van de manier waarop slachtoffers en overlevenden worden ontvangen, verwelkomd en geluisterd. Ik denk dat als de bisschoppen en de provincialen in deze wereld, in alle landen, zijn voorbeeld volgden, veel overlevenden daar echt dankbaar voor zouden zijn.<br/><br/>Aartsbisschop Diarmud Martin werd kort voor de Wereldbijeenkomst van de Families geciteerd over de Pauselijke Commissie en zei dat het te klein is zoals het momenteel is opgezet om te bereiken wat het moet bereiken. Wat is uw mening daarover? Moet de Kerk meer middelen inzetten op de manier waarop zij toezicht houdt op deze kwesties?<br/><br/>Op dit moment zijn we 16 leden uit vrijwel alle continenten, en de belangrijkste taalgroepen. Wij vertegenwoordigen een verscheidenheid van disciplines en beroepen, en het doel van de commissie - zoals de statuten die zojuist zijn afgekondigd staat - is om advies te geven aan de Heilige Vader.<br/><br/>Een algemeen misverstand over de commissie is allereerst dat we ons bezighouden met gevallen van beschuldigingen, en dat is niet het geval. Wij hebben geen juridische of bestuurlijke bevoegdheid wat betreft zaken, want als het gaat om beschuldigingen van misbruik zijn de rechtbanken en procedures vastgesteld.<br/><br/>Een tweede misverstand is dat we dingen direct op de grond promoten. Ons eerste en belangrijkste doel is dat we de Heilige Vader adviseren over zaken.<br/><br/>Vanuit mijn oogpunt, ja, moeten we meer investeren. Maar we moeten meer investeren op lokaal niveau, en we moeten ervoor zorgen dat de voorstellen van de Pauselijke Commissie worden doorgestuurd naar de Heilige Vader - wat normaal gesproken de Voorzitter doet - en dan is er een vervolgproces dat weerspiegelt wat we als advies hebben gegeven.<br/><br/>In Australië houdt Catholic Professional Standards Limited toezicht op de reactie van de kerk en biedt richtlijnen en ondersteuning om ervoor te zorgen dat alle instellingen in de kerk kindveilige instellingen zijn. Is er behoefte aan een vorm van organisatorische steun vanuit Rome voor die bisschoppen en dioceses die worstelen om deze instellingen te vormen en bescherming te bieden in die dioceses?<br/><br/>Ik denk dat de Commissie zich uiteindelijk in die richting zal ontwikkelen en dat zij nu bezig is met het inhuren van deskundigen op deze gebieden.<br/><br/>Ik denk dat de Kerk moet begrijpen dat de lokale kerken van elkaar kunnen leren. En mijn begrip is altijd geweest - en ik denk dat de Heilige Vader ons eraan heeft herinnerd - dat de Kerk niet zal functioneren als een gecentraliseerde samenleving. Zo werkt het niet, effectief. Elke bisschop, elke bisschopsconferentie, heeft tot op zekere hoogte zijn leven op zichzelf. Wat we meer moeten leren, is om kanalen van wederzijdse communicatie te openen.<br/><br/>Er zijn een aantal dingen die mensen beschuldigen van misbruik in de kerk. Als een priester en een psycholoog, en als iemand die heeft ontmoet en gewerkt met overlevenden, wat zijn uw gedachten over die kwestie?<br/><br/>Ik denk dat de vraag waar misbruik vandaan komt, de belangrijkste is, en de paus heeft dat aangesproken in zijn brief aan het volk van God die op 20 augustus is gepubliceerd. Hij zegt in de eerste paragraaf, en herhaalt het steeds opnieuw, dat de kwestie van seksueel misbruik altijd verbonden is – of bijna altijd verbonden is – niet alleen met de kwestie van machtsmisbruik, maar ook met het misbruik van het geweten.<br/><br/>Dus de werkelijke fundamentele kwestie van misbruik is veel complexer dan alleen [de kwestie van] seksualiteit - of het nu heteroseksueel of homoseksueel is. Het is een machtskwestie, en daar moeten we echt werken aan de vraag hoe we het priesterschap begrijpen, hoe we het bisdom begrijpen, hoe we onze ministeries begrijpen en leven, wat zijn de grenzen?<br/><br/>Daarom ben ik erg blij dat de jezuïetenprovincie in Australië een gedragscode opstelt, omdat we het niet alleen over seksueel misbruik van minderjarigen hebben. We praten over seksueel misbruik van volwassenen, en we praten over misbruik op andere manieren - zoals misbruik van geweten, waar je iemand dicteert wat je denkt, of je doet alsof je het van God weet, en je kunt een andere persoon vertellen: 'Je moet dat doen', tegen het geweten van die persoon.<br/><br/>Veel mensen denken dat het celibaat misbruik veroorzaakt. Zoals ik altijd zeg, is het celibaat als zodanig geen aanleiding tot misbruik - anders hoe verklaren we dat 99,9 procent van alle misbruikers geen celibaat leven, en hoe verklaren we dat 95 of 96 procent van alle priesters geen minderjarigen misbruikt? Maar het celibaat, of een gelofte van kuisheid, dat niet echt geïntegreerd is, dat niet echt goed wordt beleefd – ja, dat produceert een probleem. Soms nemen mensen om te drinken, soms nemen ze om te gokken, en soms nemen ze om seksueel wangedrag, met volwassenen en met minderjarigen.<br/><br/>De echte vraag hierover is hoe gaan we om met de notie van religieuze geestelijke macht waarmee priesters en bisschoppen zijn geïnvesteerd? Hoe kan theologie ons helpen begrijpen, en misschien hoe kan sociologie, psychologie of bedrijfsadministratie ons helpen de grenzen van macht te definiëren, en de noodzaak om je grenzen te behouden |
| I'm not surprised by this mismatch. In fact, I'd even go so far as to say this isn't something that will ever change, nor should we get all steamed up about changing it. In 10 years, we'll still have bleeding edge, complex items in the biggest concerns list, and the things we're finally getting around to understanding will be the major parts of our spending.<br/><br/>Now, Gunnar and Andy both have excellent points, specifically about IT teams seeing IT problems and solving them with IT solutions; in fact, I'm positive their points hold merit.<br/><br/>But I think there are other ideas that trump those (I did comment on their blogs about it, and later decided I should just blog here). Those top 3 concerns are bleedingly new such that:<br/><br/>we fear new things because we don't understand them, or don't understand them because they're new.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to have solid approaches to handling them.<br/><br/>they're too new for us to know if we should be worried or not! we tend to default to paranoid/worried, which is good!<br/><br/>too new to have obvious budget items assigned to them. Can I buy a box or some software that provide "cloud security" or "social media security?"<br/><br/>they're so new the business doesn't even know how to use them or what they want out of them. Let alone how we can secure them while still meeting or at least not stomping all over business needs. If the business doesn't even know how to use them yet, I'm not sure security is in any position to guide that usage securely.<br/><br/>It also should be mentioned that these new things are being largely pushed via consumerland and into the business, with IT as a sort of, "Oh yeah," thought. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth are all IT responses to typically IT issues. Of course there is a difference there. They're also very subjective issues, as opposed to very objective items like firewalls, known malicious bits, behaviors, signatures, ports. Business presents very complex issues that are often involving people (which we can't patch) and that often don't fit nicely into blanket rules. Even if we turned away from technical solutions and devoted our time into solving these problems, they are still not going to be neatly solved. Likewise, when push comes to shove, can you have and meet goals with firewalls? Can you show improvement? All of this flows from the rather subjective non-technical aspect of those issues. Sort of the difference between a child's report card and the feedback you get from a parent-teacher conference. If you have a child, which one would you be most inclined to disagree with or not necessarily believe? (The answer is the subjective one!)<br/><br/>It could be said this is the natural progression of security and technology: from shoring up the technical controls to moving up the stack towards behavior and people. Sure, these 3 top concerns can be said to punch through firewalls and network segments, but that's the nature of those things (social media "punching" through a firewall is far different than me punching through an SSH connection to bridge my home network; social media is akin to the *way* I use my SSH connection after the hold is already punched because it is needed; i.e. social media is the way port 80 is used.)<br/><br/>Basically, all indications point to not being surprised by this dichotomy. And I don't think this is some further indication that IT/security is doing it wrong, or isn't aligned properly with business, or has a technical dark-server-room background. I'm not saying we're doing things right or we're properly aligned, but the above isn't a good argument to support the theory of those deficiencies.<br/><br/>Now for a really big jump. I'd liken the current increase in mobile computing to be as big as the introduction of computers into the business and later the PC/internet into business. Now, I wasn't around when the former happened, nor was I in the industry when the personal computer revolution swept into business, but I would bet that is the closest comparison so far. I may even say the same for social media. These are damned new and they're big changes beyond just bringing in Macs or new software or some new business process. | Ik ben niet verbaasd over deze mismatch. In feite zou ik zelfs zo ver gaan om te zeggen dat dit niet iets is dat ooit zal veranderen, noch zouden we allemaal moeten opstaan om het te veranderen. Over 10 jaar zullen we nog steeds bloedende rand hebben, complexe items op de lijst van grootste zorgen, en de dingen die we eindelijk begrijpen, zullen de belangrijkste delen van onze uitgaven zijn.<br/><br/>Nu hebben Gunnar en Andy allebei uitstekende punten, met name over IT-teams die IT-problemen zien en deze oplossen met IT-oplossingen; in feite ben ik positief over hun punten.<br/><br/>Maar ik denk dat er andere ideeën zijn die die trompen (ik heb commentaar gegeven op hun blogs erover, en later besloot ik hier te bloggen). Die top 3 zorgen zijn bloedend nieuw dat:<br/><br/>We zijn bang voor nieuwe dingen omdat we ze niet begrijpen, of we begrijpen ze niet omdat ze nieuw zijn.<br/><br/>Ze zijn te nieuw voor ons om solide benaderingen te hebben om ze te behandelen.<br/><br/>ze zijn te nieuw voor ons om te weten of we ons zorgen moeten maken of niet! we hebben de neiging om in gebreke te blijven paranoïde / bezorgd, wat goed is!<br/><br/>Kan ik een doos of software kopen die "cloudbeveiliging" of "social mediabeveiliging" biedt?<br/><br/>Ze zijn zo nieuw dat het bedrijf niet eens weet hoe ze te gebruiken of wat ze van hen willen. Laat staan hoe we ze kunnen beveiligen terwijl ze nog voldoen aan of in ieder geval niet stampen over zakelijke behoeften. Als het bedrijf nog niet eens weet hoe je ze moet gebruiken, weet ik niet zeker of de beveiliging in een positie is om dat gebruik veilig te begeleiden.<br/><br/>Het is ook vermeldenswaard dat deze nieuwe dingen grotendeels via consumerland en in het bedrijfsleven worden geduwd, met IT als een soort "Oh ja", dacht. Firewalls, AV, AM, Auth zijn allemaal IT-reacties op typisch IT-problemen. Natuurlijk is er een verschil. Het zijn ook zeer subjectieve kwesties, in tegenstelling tot zeer objectieve items zoals firewalls, bekende kwaadaardige bits, gedrag, handtekeningen, poorten. Business presenteert zeer complexe kwesties die vaak mensen betreffen (die we niet kunnen patchen) en die vaak niet goed passen in blanke regels. Zelfs als we ons afwenden van technische oplossingen en onze tijd besteden aan het oplossen van deze problemen, zullen ze nog steeds niet netjes worden opgelost. Evenzo, als push komt om te duwen, kunt u doelen hebben en bereiken met firewalls? Kunt u verbetering laten zien? Dit alles vloeit voort uit het nogal subjectieve niet-technische aspect van die kwesties. Soort van het verschil tussen de rapportkaart van een kind en de feedback die je krijgt van een ouder-leraar conferentie. Als je een kind hebt, welke zou je het meest geneigd zijn om het oneens te zijn met of niet noodzakelijkerwijs te geloven? (Het antwoord is het subjectieve!)<br/><br/>Je zou kunnen zeggen dat dit de natuurlijke vooruitgang van veiligheid en technologie is: van het opschorten van de technische controles tot het verplaatsen van de stapel naar gedrag en mensen. Tuurlijk, deze top 3 zorgen kunnen worden gezegd om te punch door firewalls en netwerksegmenten, maar dat is de aard van die dingen (social media "punching" door een firewall is veel anders dan ik punching door een SSH-verbinding om mijn thuisnetwerk te overbruggen; sociale media is vergelijkbaar met de * manier * Ik gebruik mijn SSH-verbinding nadat de hold al is geponst omdat het nodig is; dwz.<br/><br/>Kortom, alle aanwijzingen wijzen erop dat je niet verrast bent door deze dichotomie. En ik denk niet dat dit een verdere indicatie is dat IT / beveiliging het verkeerd doet, of niet goed is afgestemd op het bedrijfsleven, of een technische dark-server-ruimte achtergrond heeft. Ik zeg niet dat we dingen goed doen of goed op elkaar afstemmen, maar het bovenstaande is geen goed argument om de theorie van die tekortkomingen te ondersteunen.<br/><br/>Nu voor een echt grote sprong. Ik zou de huidige toename van mobiele computing vergelijken met de introductie van computers in het bedrijfsleven en later de pc / internet in het bedrijfsleven. Nu, ik was niet in de buurt toen de eerste gebeurde, noch was ik in de industrie toen de personal computer revolutie in het bedrijfsleven kwam, maar ik zou wedden dat dat de dichtste vergelijking tot nu toe is. Ik kan zelfs hetzelfde zeggen voor sociale media. Deze zijn verdomd nieuw en ze zijn grote veranderingen die verder gaan dan alleen Macs of nieuwe software of een nieuw bedrijfsproces. |
