| Bacopa<br/><br/>19 Nov 2015<br/>Posted by Doxiderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is a perennial plant that thrives in marshy subtropical and tropical regions around the globe. The highly regarded herb is a key ingredient in Doxiderol, a nutritional supplement that enhances cognitive function. Bacopa was chosen for its ability to protect the brain and increase acetylcholine, a biochemical messenger that enables the nervous system to relay information.<br/><br/>Ayurvedic practitioners first described the therapeutic properties of bacopa in 300 BC. The physicians recorded bacopa's abilities to enhance intelligence and memory. Nearly 2,500 years later, a growing body of modern research confirms the cognitive benefits of bacopa recorded in the Ayurvedic text.<br/><br/>In 1987, researchers in India evaluated the effects of bacopa on the intellectual function of school-aged children. During the four-week study, they administered bacopa to 40 children who were 6 to 8 years old. The scientists determined that bacopa increased perception and memory. The children were able to solve maze exercises quicker and more accurately after receiving bacopa. Many parents in India routinely use bacopa to enhance their children's intellectual development.<br/><br/>A 12-week study published in the August 2001 issue of Psychopharmacology investigated the effects of bacopa on cognitive function. Scientists randomly assigned the healthy volunteers, aged 18 to 65, to receive bacopa or an inactive substance. They also used a double-blind configuration for the study to conceal the identities of the products. Researchers use this design to ensure that the test results are valid because it eliminates bias by the researchers and participants. The bacopa group experienced a significant improvement in the speed at which they were able to process visual information. The participants also learned faster and stored new memories more efficiently.<br/><br/>In 2007, a Texas A&M College of Medicine laboratory study revealed one of the mechanisms responsible for bacopa's ability to promote brain health. According to the scientists, bacopa uses polyphenols to prevent oxidative stress and the damage that it causes to healthy brain cells. Bacopa also reduces harmful deposits of a substance known as beta-amyloid, which is the primary component of the plaque in the brains of patients with Alzheimer's disease.<br/><br/>A double-blind study published in the July 2008 issue of the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evaluated the effect of bacopa on elderly patients. The study confirmed that bacopa increased cognitive performance while reducing stress. According to the authors, the benefits achieved in this study confirmed the results of earlier research.<br/><br/>A 90-day study published in the December 2008 issue of Phytotherapy Research confirms the cognitive benefits that were previously demonstrated in other bacopa studies. Bacopa significantly improved the ability of the participants to temporarily store and use information required for completing a complex task. The double-blind study also demonstrated that bacopa reduced the time required to process visual information.<br/><br/>In addition to enhancing nerve signal transmission, the scientists theorize that bacopa increases cognitive function by reducing anxiety. Numerous studies indicate that anxiety interferes with the ability to perform tasks that require higher-level cognitive functions, such as learning and memorization. Stress disrupts biochemical messengers and healthy nerve signal transmission. Bacopa alleviates stress and restores a sense of calm by increasing acetylcholine levels, which reduces your heart rate and enables you to take deeper breaths.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is a great way to obtain the benefits of bacopa. This holistic supplement also contains other natural ingredients that promote brain health and support your ability to focus and concentrate on complex task as well as memorize information. | Bacopa<br/><br/>19 nov 2015<br/>Geplaatst door Doxyderol<br/><br/>Bacopa is een meerjarige plant die gedijt in moerassige subtropische en tropische gebieden over de hele wereld. Het hoog aangeschreven kruid is een belangrijk ingrediënt in Doxyderol, een voedingssupplement dat de cognitieve functie verbetert. Bacopa werd gekozen om zijn vermogen om de hersenen te beschermen en acetylcholine te verhogen, een biochemische boodschapper die het zenuwstelsel in staat stelt om informatie door te geven.<br/><br/>Ayurvedische beoefenaars beschreef voor het eerst de therapeutische eigenschappen van bacopa in 300 voor Christus. De artsen registreerden de capaciteiten van bacopa om intelligentie en geheugen te verbeteren. Bijna 2500 jaar later bevestigt een groeiend aantal moderne onderzoeken de cognitieve voordelen van bacopa die zijn vastgelegd in de Ayurvedische tekst.<br/><br/>In 1987 evalueerden onderzoekers in India de effecten van bacopa op de intellectuele functie van schoolgaande kinderen. Tijdens de vier weken durende studie gaven ze bacopa aan 40 kinderen van 6 tot 8 jaar oud. De wetenschappers stelden vast dat bacopa de perceptie en het geheugen verhoogde. De kinderen waren in staat om doolhofoefeningen sneller en nauwkeuriger op te lossen na het ontvangen van bacopa. Veel ouders in India gebruiken bacopa routinematig om de intellectuele ontwikkeling van hun kinderen te verbeteren.<br/><br/>Een 12-weekse studie gepubliceerd in het augustus 2001 nummer van Psychofarmacology onderzocht de effecten van bacopa op de cognitieve functie. Wetenschappers willekeurig toegewezen gezonde vrijwilligers, in de leeftijd van 18 tot 65, om bacopa of een inactieve stof te ontvangen. Ze gebruikten ook een dubbelblinde configuratie voor de studie om de identiteit van de producten te verbergen. Onderzoekers gebruiken dit ontwerp om ervoor te zorgen dat de testresultaten geldig zijn, omdat het bias door de onderzoekers en deelnemers elimineert. De bacopa groep ondervond een significante verbetering in de snelheid waarmee ze visuele informatie konden verwerken. De deelnemers leerden ook sneller en opgeslagen nieuwe herinneringen efficiënter.<br/><br/>In 2007 onthulde een laboratoriumstudie van het Texas A&M College of Medicine een van de mechanismen die verantwoordelijk zijn voor het vermogen van bacopa om de gezondheid van de hersenen te bevorderen. Volgens de wetenschappers gebruikt bacopa polyfenolen om oxidatieve stress en de schade die het veroorzaakt aan gezonde hersencellen te voorkomen. Bacopa vermindert ook schadelijke afzettingen van een stof die bekend staat als bèta-amyloïde, wat het primaire bestanddeel is van de plaque in de hersenen van patiënten met de ziekte van Alzheimer.<br/><br/>Een dubbelblinde studie gepubliceerd in het juli 2008 nummer van het Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine evalueerde het effect van bacopa op oudere patiënten. De studie bevestigde dat bacopa verhoogde cognitieve prestaties terwijl het verminderen van stress. Volgens de auteurs bevestigden de voordelen die in deze studie werden bereikt, de resultaten van eerder onderzoek.<br/><br/>Een 90-daagse studie gepubliceerd in het december 2008 nummer van Phytotherapy Research bevestigt de cognitieve voordelen die eerder werden aangetoond in andere bacopa studies. Bacopa verbeterde aanzienlijk het vermogen van de deelnemers om informatie die nodig is voor het voltooien van een complexe taak tijdelijk op te slaan en te gebruiken. De dubbelblinde studie toonde ook aan dat bacopa de tijd die nodig is om visuele informatie te verwerken, verminderde.<br/><br/>Naast het verbeteren van zenuwsignaaloverdracht, theoretiseren de wetenschappers dat bacopa de cognitieve functie verhoogt door angst te verminderen. Talrijke studies geven aan dat angst interfereert met het vermogen om taken uit te voeren die hogere cognitieve functies vereisen, zoals leren en onthouden. Stress verstoort biochemische boodschappers en gezonde zenuwsignaaltransmissie. Bacopa verlicht stress en herstelt een gevoel van rust door het verhogen van acetylcholine niveaus, die uw hartslag verlaagt en u in staat stelt om dieper adem te halen.<br/><br/>Doxiderol is een geweldige manier om de voordelen van bacopa te verkrijgen. Dit holistische supplement bevat ook andere natuurlijke ingrediënten die de gezondheid van de hersenen bevorderen en uw vermogen ondersteunen om zich te concentreren op complexe taken en informatie te onthouden. |

She can also sense demonic auras as well as evil auras. When she was born and growing, however, her powers were sealed and she was much less powerful. Since the defeat of the one sealing her powers, Kagome has reached her full potential.<br/><br/>PURIFICATION By making a physical connection, Kagome has the ability to purify both poison and darkness from a subject (living and inanimate). To do so, she projects her spiritual powers through her hand.<br/><br/>SPIRITUAL BARRIERS With her full potential, Kagome has the ability to create a barrier around herself and expand it around others. It is a dome-shaped barrier that can destroy weak demons that make contact with the barrier.<br/><br/>IMPROVED EYESIGHT<br/>Kagome has the ability to see things that are often invisible to the human eye: ghosts, spirits, divine and evil auras.<br/><br/>ABILITIES WITH WEAPONS<br/>Kagome has the ability to use a bow and arrow. She has been self trained, and after years of practice, her arrow rarely misses its mark. Alongside this, Kagome has the ability to infuse her arrows with powers. She can infuse an arrows with her spiritual powers which allows them to penetrate demonic forces, destroy spells, and purify objects. She can infuse her bow with her powers and deflect enemy attacks. She has the ability to infuse her arrows with purifying energy to purify poison as well as powerful, long distant demonic attacks. And, finally, she has the ability to bypass others with her arrow: If her target happens to be behind a barrier or a hostage, the arrow can teleport and hit only her target<br/><br/>The rest of her abilities have become rather unimportant as they are related to time travel (through the Bone Eater's Well), the Shikon Jewel, or her previous incarnation.<br/><br/>the canon<br/><br/>Kagome has been pulled a few days after her high school graduation, however, before the Bone Eater's Well has opened again to allow her to return to the past permanently.<br/><br/>freestyle<br/><br/>memories<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>The sound of her name was a soft whisper in the back of her mind, like a call muffled by the wind. It was the sound of a distant memory, a voice that she had started to forget but desperately clung to all the same. It was her mother's voice, twisted in the sorrow of her lost daughter. Afterall, Kagome banished without a trace. She vividly remembered those moments, the way the day had begun, what she had for breakfast and the last thing she had said to her mother. It was haunting, those memories, because it was like any other time she had slipped between worlds. She had woken, listless, because she had no purpose outside of school. She could find a job, and was scheduled for an interview that day. Her heart hadn't been in it, but it was what she needed to do.<br/><br/>She remembered the feeling of dread, sucking it up and giving herself a pep talk that she could do this. That she could progress in the life that she was meant to now that things had been settled in the past. Of course, she had the lingering feeling that she no longer belonged in her own time or her own life. Not with everything that she had left behind.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of the wood beneath her fingers, the way her hand had curled into the handle to slide the door open. She remembered that she paused, turning to her mother with a bright and vibrant smile as she shook herself from her stupor. "I'm taking off." She remembered how strong her voice sounded, the smile on her mother's lips as her eyes shone with pride. Her mother bade her farewell, which didn't seem any different than before but somehow the weight of the words settled in heavier on Kagome's shoulders the more she reflected.<br/><br/>Briefly, the thoughts flickered forward, wondering if her mother worried over her, missed her like she did. Kagome could openly admit that her mother's strength, her support for the fact that her daughter slipped through time so frequently. There were times when she thought herself weak for not having the woman to lean on.<br/><br/>However, she remembered that she did muster up a meager amount of strength.She could remember the shift in the air, the temperature notably different than what she had expected, blinking at the sudden and unfamiliar surroundings. It was not her family's shrine. And when she turned to go back, to slip through the door she had come through, she was met with unfamiliar and cold metal beneath her fingertips and an interior that was not the entrance of her house. A man stood before her, behind a counter, who stared at her with eyes as wide as her own.<br/><br/>She didn't panic, at least. Being torn through time and placed in impossible situations at least built your willpower as far as strange happenings went. Because it wasn't every day that someone found themselves dragged into the past by a demon, intent on ripping a powerful jewel from their body that they didn't even know was there. And then there was the fact that she had shattered said powerful jewel into who knows how many pieces and was tasked on finding them. Such things were not normal, and she had needed to square up and roll with it once she realized that was her reality. It had seemed so simple, just gather the shards and fix the jewel.<br/><br/>But it hadn't been easy, there were many demons after the shards and the jewel itself. And one particularly powerful demon with a wish that he was determined to see fulfilled. To this day, she had never learned his wish but knew it had never been granted even once he had the blasted thing completed. He had ruined so many lives for the sake of nothing. Ruined so many lives for such a futile task. Naraku had been the most difficult foe, and the one who had been the center of everything that had gone wrong in all of her friend's lives.<br/><br/>But, it was that unpredicability, that necessity to roll with what was happening and the willpower that she had gained from her adventure that she remembered drawing upon to come up with a story that fit in the moment that didn't seem too whimsical or far fetched. She needed to be believed, she needed to survive.<br/><br/>Afterall, she faced worse than a man in a camera store. She had lied through her teeth to save her life before.<br/><br/>"I was looking for a job." In the end, it wasn't a complete lie. After all, she had set out of her house with the intent of attending a job interview. Her state of dress would at least attest to that much. It was one of the easier fibs she had ever told.<br/><br/>And, for some reason, that crazy man hired her.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolled over in her bed as she pushed back the distant memories, refusing to acknowledge that she was really awake. She clawed at the last glimpses of sleep, begging it to return and to take her back into its embrace. She closed her eyes, willing sleep to come and was only met with memories. The echoes of a song sang in the distance of her memories, a song that had often tormented her, given the same name as her. The voice that sang was no longer reminiscent of her mother, but the voices of children who she had often played with growing up. They called back the memories, even though it had been years since she started this live, even though she was happy in this life, the call of these memories was too loud.<br/><br/>Suddenly, she was falling back into them and sleep evaded her again. She was watching herself in her family's embrace while Inuyasha was pulled back into the well, looking as startled as she had felt. The memories of that moment, those feelings, were still so strong. The feeling of heartbreak and sorrow welled up again though it had been so long since she had felt like she had been ripped away from everything that mattered to her.<br/><br/>Of course her family mattered, and she was happy to be in their arms again. She could never fully, truly describe how she had felt in those days. She still couldn't explain the way she felt split in two, with warring desires to be in both her past and present. She remembered the futile attempts to jump through the well, fingers clawing at the ground in a desperate plea to let her return. The first month home, she didn't sleep so much as she cried.<br/><br/>Elysion had garnished a similar reaction, though it was not so fierce because she didn't know exactly where she had slipped through nor did she know where she could worm her way back. Her explorations were subtle between working her job and trying to settle herself into this life. She had no intentions of staying, no intentions of lingering longer than she needed. And while she didn't try as fiercely as she had when she tried to return to the past, her passion was tenfold because she had no ties to this world. Because she was truly alone… With no hope of anyone to reach her.<br/><br/>In her irrational moments, she thought the Jewel had pulled her back and found a new hell for her to reside in. A new hell that would force her to make a wish, but she remembered very clearly that she had wished it gone forever. That didn't stop her dreams, the times when she woke up in the night sobbing. And those memories of her past were the hardest to deal with, the hardest to forget. Her heart began to race in a panic as she turned in her bed again, her breath became a struggle as she fought against a panic attack induced by her wandering mind this late into the night.<br/><br/>She hated feeling so weak, so afraid.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome finally pulled herself from bed, her room lit with a pale light that was enough to guide her to the bathroom. She stood before the mirror, the sink running while she stared at her reflection. Raven colored hair covered her face and she felt as bad as she looked. Her first morning in Elysion was similar to this, only she was in worse shape.<br/><br/>She had found a place to sleep, managing to work out a deal with the owner of the building to allow her to stay a small period of time without paying. Perhaps it had been Miroku's influence that allowed her to strike such deals, as the monk was known for his way in charming (or scamming) people into giving them more than enough for the work they had done. The monk had always been that way, since they had first met. He would claim the dwelling of a lord to be haunted when it was not or, claim that they were subject to an attack when they would not be. He would sell his wards and charms for such high prices. It worked practically every time and she wondered why people had been so willing to trust him.<br/><br/>Perhaps it was his smile, or the fact that he was a monk that the people of the past were so willing to crumble. He never preyed on the weak, at least. He always did what was right and he was a symbol of strength to her at times when he would push through everything in order to do what was right. He pushed through the fact that he was dying, that he was cursed, and tried to do something about it rather than wallowing in his fate. He had pushed himself to the limit in the time leading up to their final fight. And she had been glad that they had defeated Naraku before he could become subject to the same fate as his father, and his father before him.<br/><br/>As far as her own charms went, however, she was more fair than her friend and made the deal reasonable. She doubted that anyone in this world would pay a hefty price for an exorcism or banishing demons. They were too technologically advanced for that. But she was clever enough, and smart enough, to make a good deal.<br/><br/>But now, Kagome was in a better place though the look on her face looked the same. Haunted, tired, drained...<br/><br/>A quick glance at a clock on the wall told her that she could try to sleep longer. But she opted out of that, not wanting to face the flashbacks again. She took a shower instead, using the cold water to chase away her demons, to fill her lungs with a sharp intake of breath and force herself awake.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>It didn't work.<br/><br/>Not in the way she was wanting. The cold water certainly forced the air into her lungs, forced her mind to wake and muscles to seize. A bitter laugh was pulled from her lips as she tilted her head back and found herself remembering more. Today, she wasn't going to escape them so easily. She wasn't going to recover so simply, to recover just because she willed it.<br/><br/>Sometimes, there's no avoiding the thoughts you wanted to. Even when you were certain that you were past them.<br/><br/>Sango would have been a great help in this situation. The demon slayer was her best friend, she would even go as far as to call her the sister that she never had. An older sister who was wise, always had her side when trouble arose. Particularly boy trouble, when such things were rather trivial but it was fun to have a crush and for her friend to be mad on her behalf when Inuyasha made her sad. After all, it had been often that the half-demon would run to his dead lover's side and break her heart more than once.<br/><br/>But, Sango also inspired her in other ways. After all the woman had faced, she had always been so strong, so sure... Even in the times that she had doubted herself, she always pulled through. She admired that she had the ability to survive after losing her whole family -- the reminder of this often pushed Kagome to survive, because she lost everyone to this world -- and then having her brother become a pawn of Naraku. It wasn't easy, couldn't have been something to that just anyone could face and still go forward with. She still smiled, even with that pain and those reminders... She was often so bright, even in the darker times.<br/><br/>And right now, she wanted to lean into the older woman's side, to take comfort in the fact that she was there and she was supportive. She felt that Sango would somehow pull through this, and offer some words of strength and understanding. It was times like these that made these spells worse, the constant reminder that she was without her family.<br/><br/>"I don't want to be alone." She cried aloud in her solitude, the sound of the shower drowning out the plea.<br/><br/>She wasn't afraid to admit it.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Another hour had slipped by before she had realized it. Her skin was cold from the water and it felt like ice ran through her veins. She hadn't realized she had begun to shiver until her hand reached to turn off the water and end her shower. Kagome didn't seek her own gaze in the mirror again, instead, she wrapped herself in towels and trudged out of the bathroom, up the stairs and into her kitchen. She started on making a light breakfast, idly reading through her notes for the day as the food cooked.<br/><br/>Her career was really taking off these last years. Her photos were featured in many galleries, her name started to frequent many lips for those who were interested in photography.<br/><br/>The job she had asked for on a whim had sparked it all. She had been far more lucky than she had expected to be in this world. Never lucky enough to slip back through the cracks into her own world, but lucky enough to do well. As she turned back to the stove, she remembered the time she had finally given up on returning home. It was about two years into her life here, as she had started to venture into photography as more than just a hobby but something she could make a name for herself with.<br/><br/>That day had been particularly pleasant, the sun was high in the sky and she had found herself taking some photos of the natural scenery. A little boy had hidden in one of the plants, and she had caught a picture of the moment his face had settled into a cheerful, mischievous grin the moment before he had jumped out to startle his prey. It reminded her of Shippou, the little kitsune she had, essentially, adopted. He, too, had been torn from his family when they had first met. His father killed and he was determined to avenge him. While young, he did seem so mature in their first encounters.<br/><br/>Maybe it had been the influence of Inuyasha that allowed the kit to act like a kid again, to be young and whimsical at times while others he was more mature. He offered comfort to her in his own way, and she tried to care for him as she would her own though she had been so young then as well. However, her youth did not stop her from understanding how to tend to him or care for him like her child. Her heart swelled when he smiled, when he had been so happy for his gift of crayons and took the time to make art. She was so proud of each drawing that he had finished that she knew that this was how a mother would feel in such a situation.<br/><br/>The pain that had ripped through her was too much, too sudden. She missed him and wanted to see how much he had grown since she had been gone. She had missed so much...<br/><br/>To spare herself any further pain, any false hopes… She gave up. And focused on bettering herself.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Breakfast tasted bland, boring, and inspired. Only after she had finished did she realized she had forgotten to any sort of spices or flavor to the food. It was too late now to remember that much, as her mind was too busy remembering other details of her life that clearly had become more important than her food.<br/><br/>"Sit!"<br/><br/>Of course, nothing happened when she had angrily yelled at one particularly frustrating client that reminded her of the half-demon. He was being particularly stubborn and rude, wanting a photo taken his way rather than letting it work out naturally. You could try to force wild animals to behave how you wanted. But, rarely did anyone succeed with force. Inuyasha wasn't as bad, however. Inuyasha had learned before she had been forced away from him. He had become gentler, more understanding, more mature though there were times he was still childish and cocky.<br/><br/>She remember how red her cheeks had burned, but how she stood her ground and fired him. She told him she refused to work for anyone or with anyone who wanted to twist something beyond it's nature, beyond it's own desires.<br/><br/>She should have compared the man to Naraku rather than Inuyasha. Though her client did not have such extreme intentions. At least the feeling afterwards was a pleasant memory. The freedom of knowing that she had come so far that she could refuse work that she didn't want to do, to be her own person that was independent of others. She could say that she made it at that point. Even though she heard rumors days later with words meant to slander her.<br/><br/>She defended herself righteously, like she did towards the end of her journey. After all, she was the only one who could protect herself in this world.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Morning light began to creep into her home, reminding her again of the passage of time. Again, she considered the list of things she had to do and debated on where to start. Or, if she should even start at all. With how the day began, she didn't know if she could consider that a great idea. It was doubtful that she would be successful with how lost in herself she was becoming.<br/><br/>She didn't want to mess up her latest work. Because she had done that on a few occasions before. It wasn't pleasant to try and recover from a complete disaster.<br/><br/>Kagome remembered the feeling of her expensive, brand new, camera slipping from her hands. She wasn't prepared to support it, because she had just removed it from her bag. Part of her screamed on the inside. A dramatic, over-the-top, full on scream that she frequently did when she was much, much younger. When she was struggling to make it through middle school while hopping between times. The other part of her had remained frozen in place while her lense completely shattered and the rest of the camera had broken along with it.<br/><br/>Seeing Inuyasha's brother, a full demon, standing before her was the last thing she expected when she had made her way out for her photos. He stood as proud as ever, as tall as ever, as imposing as she remembered. He didn't look fazed at all to be in an entirely different world, though she was never the best at reading his mind. His name on her lips was so potent, that she could remember the tiniest feelings as she did. Her lips were chapped, her mouth felt dry, and the bubbling feeling of anxiety in her stomach made her feel sick.<br/><br/>She didn't want her hopes to be up.<br/><br/>But, she wanted him to be there, even if they were not friends. They were allies, if anything, since they had fought side by side. And something was better than absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>And Kagome had the sense enough not to throw herself at him, to wrap her arms around him in relief that knowing she was not alone. Her camera no longer mattered when she approached him. She remembered that nothing else mattered for days as she spent time with him, not speaking of their world but speaking (or, she was speaking and he simply acknowledged that fact).<br/><br/>When, exactly, she fell for him though… Kagome couldn't recall. It was a subtle thing, just like he was. But she knew the feeling was there. And he let her know that she was not alone in the fact that she had fallen, that feelings had somehow blossomed.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>A feeling of weightlessness overtook her and suddenly her eyes opened while her mind desperately clawed for the last thing she was doing. She didn't recall when she had fallen asleep on her couch, but she knew the last place she had been was on the far too comfortable cushions. She didn't struggle, however, or fight the weightlessness as she was in familiar arms. Her head tilted against Sesshoumaru's chest, taking comfort in the fact that he was here and she wasn't alone.<br/><br/>"Welcome back." His response was a soft hum in acknowledgement. He didn't need to speak much for her to understand his intent, or the rest of what he had to say.<br/><br/>He carried her back to her bed, settled her into it with ease. Her eyes met his and she smiled easily because no more memories drifted back, no more recollections teased at her. No, whenever he was near, she never fell back into those thoughts. He had helped, and the years had helped. Today was just… One of those days.<br/><br/>"Sleep." He commanded with ease, her eyes rolled at him but she did not fight because she was tired. Her hand clung tightly to him, while she felt his opposite hand press to her forehead in assessment of her wellbeing.<br/><br/>"I'm okay," she said, her words firm with her promise.<br/><br/>She was okay. She was alive. And she was happy.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>shipper<br/><br/>summary<br/><br/>Kagome, at one point in her life, was a rather regular teenage girl until she was attacked by a demon inside her family's well house. The demon dragged her down into the well, which magically transported her about 500 years into the past. There, she learned that a sacred jewel was encased inside her body as she was the reincarnation of a priestess that had died 50 years prior to the time she was dragged into. The jewel was ripped from her body and the demon that dragged her through time was defeated by the half-demon that she freed who was pinned to the tree. Kagome befriended the half-demon, Inuyasha, in time and traveled with him to restore the jewel that she, herself, shattered. Though it was not so straightforward and easy to do as many demons and humans sought the jewel for their own purposes. She befriended a young kitsune demon, a monk, and a demon slayer who all traveled with her to restore the jewel.<br/><br/>Her group, however, was not the one to complete the jewel. Instead, an evil half-demon who manipulated the majority of the major events in most of her companion's lives. When he finally collected all the pieces of the jewel and made his wish on the tainted object, Kagome was drawn into the jewel itself with the intent of her making a selfish wish to keep her trapped inside forever, keeping the jewel alive. It was the stubbornness of Inuyasha that managed to save her from the darkness. In the end, she returned to her natural time, finished high school as was expect from a girl of her timeline. Though days later, Kagome ended up in Elysion. She has been in this world for five years, and has long since given up on returning home. She's settled happily into her new life.<br/><br/>platonic<br/><br/>It's rather easy for Kagome to make new friends, she hasn't changed much from her youth. She is a cheerful young woman who is empathetic and welcoming to most of all in her life. In her youth, she befriended demons when most would fear them. Even demons that used to eat humans, she has befriended and she changed their ways (she'd like to think). This being said, it's really easy to become her friend as long as someone is able to shown that they are willing to be redeemed, or show that they are not completely evil. She feels greatly for everyone she meets, so it's hard for her not to be drawn to others in a desire to be friends.<br/><br/>antagonistic<br/><br/>The only way to earn Kagome's wrath is to be so deplorable, so evil, and so far beyond redemption that she can't see any good in you. And she can see the good in pretty much everyone and everything. Honestly, with whom she has faced? A half-demon that pitted two lovers against each other, that cursed the entire male line of one of her friends, and then had her best friend's brother kill their family… Yeah, I don't see her hating anyone without them really, really working for it. Feel free to give it a shot, though.<br/><br/>romantic<br/><br/>When in love, Kagome is a strong support, always staying there even when things may be rough. However, Kagome is not looking for love, wasn't looking for love when she arrived so any past relationships don't exist. This isn't to say that someone hasn't fallen in love with her. She can definitely be the subject of someone's unrequited love, she'll probably be oblivious about it, though. Finally, Kagome is currently engaged to Sesshoumaru, surprisingly. I'm totally open to potential AU things, though. <3<br/><br/>fandom hell<br/><br/>age ancient<br/><br/>species space queen<br/><br/>occupation dying<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>pro<br/>she/her est 62woo i suck at plot replies. but ok anyway!!! neptune is very friendly and has that 'cool' persona, he's really fun to be around, and he's SUPER good to work with. like he's super patient and he'll do anything she asks of him--he's really easy to work with, definitely in comparison to other models. so i love the idea of them being all work oriented friends at first and then turning into something more. neptune definitely tries to surround himself with people, because he loves having friends, and kagome is pretty much his type too? like she's sweet and she's a strong woman, and he is actually better friends with women than he is with men, idk why, he just loves being surrounded by female friends who knows. i love my guys being super good friends and protecting their girl friends honestly. but oh M A N i love pseduo-family type relationships and neptune is an only child, so he hasn't had any like, familial relationships like that. so her looking out for him all big sister like would make him be like ????? cause he's confused but also he actually really likes that LOL! they're both good kids, i think they'd be really fun ^^<br/><br/>fandom fire emblem: fates<br/><br/>age ninteen<br/><br/>species Part human / part dragon<br/><br/>occupation representative guardian<br/><br/>prefers she/her<br/><br/>awards<br/><br/>yonder<br/>she/her aest 20 posts<br/><br/>I haven't seen Inuyasha at all but... from what I've read Kagome seems to be one of those people who might be able to help Corrin out with her emotional state.

Frankly she hasn't worked through everything yet since she was essentially at the head of a full-scale war.

You know, she's also a singer/performer at a local theater so I can imagine Kagome going there to scope things out and then catching Elsa backstage or something--and then the friendship could blossom from there!

Ze kan zowel demonische aura's als kwade aura's voelen. Toen ze werd geboren en opgroeide, werden haar krachten echter verzegeld en was ze veel minder krachtig. Sinds de nederlaag van degene die haar krachten verzegeld, heeft Kagome haar volledige potentieel bereikt.<br/><br/>REINIGING Door een fysieke verbinding te maken, heeft Kagome het vermogen om zowel vergif als duisternis van een onderwerp (levend en levenloos) te zuiveren. Om dit te doen, projecteert ze haar spirituele krachten door haar hand.<br/><br/>Met haar volledige potentieel heeft Kagome de mogelijkheid om een barrière rond zichzelf te creëren en deze uit te breiden rond anderen. Het is een koepelvormige barrière die zwakke demonen kan vernietigen die contact maken met de barrière.<br/><br/>VERBETERD OOGZICHT<br/>Kagome heeft het vermogen om dingen te zien die vaak onzichtbaar zijn voor het menselijk oog: geesten, geesten, goddelijke en kwade aura's.<br/><br/>ABILITEITEN MET WERKZAAMHEDEN<br/>Kagome heeft de mogelijkheid om een boog en pijl te gebruiken. Ze is zelf getraind, en na jaren van oefenen, mist haar pijl zelden haar stempel. Daarnaast heeft Kagome de mogelijkheid om haar pijlen met krachten te doordringen. Ze kan een pijl doordringen met haar spirituele krachten waardoor ze demonische krachten kunnen doordringen, spreuken kunnen vernietigen en objecten kunnen zuiveren. Ze kan haar boog doordringen met haar krachten en vijandelijke aanvallen afbuigen. Ze heeft de mogelijkheid om haar pijlen te doordringen met zuiverende energie om gif te zuiveren, evenals krachtige, verre demonische aanvallen. En ten slotte heeft ze de mogelijkheid om anderen met haar pijl te omzeilen: Als haar doelwit zich achter een barrière of een gijzelaar bevindt, kan de pijl alleen haar doelwit teleporteren en raken<br/><br/>De rest van haar vaardigheden zijn vrij onbelangrijk geworden omdat ze gerelateerd zijn aan tijdreizen (door de Bone Eater's Well), de Shikon Jewel, of haar vorige incarnatie.<br/><br/>Het kanon<br/><br/>Kagome is echter een paar dagen na haar middelbare school afstuderen getrokken, voordat de Bone Eater's Well opnieuw is geopend om haar in staat te stellen permanent terug te keren naar het verleden.<br/><br/>Freestyle<br/><br/>Herinneringen<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Het geluid van haar naam was een zachte fluistering in haar achterhoofd, als een door de wind gedempte roep. Het was het geluid van een verre herinnering, een stem die ze begon te vergeten, maar wanhopig vasthield aan alles. Het was de stem van haar moeder, verdraaid in het verdriet van haar verloren dochter. Kagome verbannen zonder een spoor. Ze herinnerde zich levendig die momenten, de manier waarop de dag was begonnen, wat ze had voor het ontbijt en het laatste wat ze tegen haar moeder had gezegd. Het was spookachtig, die herinneringen, want het was net als elke andere keer dat ze tussen werelden was uitgegleden. Ze was wakker geworden, listig, omdat ze buiten school geen doel had. Ze kon een baan vinden en was die dag gepland voor een interview. Haar hart zat er niet in, maar het was wat ze moest doen.<br/><br/>Ze herinnerde zich het gevoel van angst, zuigde het op en gaf zichzelf een pep talk dat ze dit kon doen. Dat ze vooruitgang kon boeken in het leven dat ze was bedoeld voor nu dat dingen in het verleden waren geregeld. Natuurlijk had ze het blijvende gevoel dat ze niet meer thuishoorde in haar eigen tijd of haar eigen leven. Niet met alles wat ze had achtergelaten.<br/><br/>Kagome herinnerde zich het gevoel van het hout onder haar vingers, de manier waarop haar hand in het handvat gekruld was om de deur open te schuiven. Ze herinnerde zich dat ze stopte en zich met een heldere en levendige glimlach naar haar moeder wendde toen ze zichzelf schudde van haar verbijstering. Ze herinnerde zich hoe luid haar stem klonk, de glimlach op de lippen van haar moeder terwijl haar ogen van trots schitterden. Haar moeder bad haar afscheid, wat niet anders leek dan voorheen, maar op de een of andere manier het gewicht van de woorden die zwaarder op Kagome's schouders zaten, hoe meer ze weerspiegelde.<br/><br/>In het kort flikkerden de gedachten naar voren, zich afvragend of haar moeder zich zorgen maakte over haar, haar miste zoals zij deed. Kagome kon openlijk toegeven dat de kracht van haar moeder, haar steun voor het feit dat haar dochter zo vaak door de tijd glipte. Er waren momenten dat ze dacht dat ze zwak was omdat ze de vrouw niet had om op te leunen.<br/><br/>Ze herinnerde zich echter dat ze een magere hoeveelheid kracht verzamelde. Ze kon zich de verschuiving in de lucht herinneren, de temperatuur opmerkelijk anders dan ze had verwacht, knipperend in de plotselinge en onbekende omgeving. Het was niet het heiligdom van haar familie. En toen ze zich omdraaide om terug te gaan, om door de deur te glijden die ze had doorlopen, werd ze onder haar vingertoppen ontmoet met onbekend en koud metaal en een interieur dat niet de ingang van haar huis was. Een man stond voor haar, achter een toonbank, die haar aankeek met ogen zo breed als die van haar.<br/><br/>Ze raakte tenminste niet in paniek omdat ze door de tijd werd verscheurd en in onmogelijke situaties werd geplaatst, op zijn minst je wilskracht opbouwde tot zover vreemde gebeurtenissen gingen. Omdat het niet elke dag was dat iemand zichzelf door een demon in het verleden sleurde, met de bedoeling om een krachtig juweel uit hun lichaam te rukken waarvan ze niet eens wisten dat het er was. En dan was er het feit dat ze dat krachtige juweeltje had verbrijzeld in wie weet hoeveel stukken en werd opgedragen om ze te vinden. Dergelijke dingen waren niet normaal, en ze had moeten rechtop staan en rollen met het zodra ze zich realiseerde dat dat haar realiteit was. Het leek zo eenvoudig, verzamel gewoon de scherven en maak het juweel vast.<br/><br/>Maar het was niet gemakkelijk geweest, er waren veel demonen achter de scherven en het juweel zelf. En een bijzonder krachtige demon met een wens die hij vastbesloten was te zien vervuld. Tot op de dag van vandaag had ze zijn wens nooit geleerd, maar ze wist dat het nooit was toegekend, zelfs niet nadat hij het geblazen ding had voltooid. Hij had zoveel levens voor niets geruïneerd. Hij had zoveel levens geruïneerd voor zo'n nutteloze taak. Naraku was de moeilijkste vijand geweest, en degene die het middelpunt was geweest van alles wat in het leven van haar vriend verkeerd was gegaan.<br/><br/>Maar het was die onvoorspelbaarheid, die noodzaak om te rollen met wat er gebeurde en de wilskracht die ze had opgedaan uit haar avontuur dat ze zich herinnerde te tekenen om een verhaal te bedenken dat paste in het moment dat niet te grillig of ver weg leek. Ze moest geloofd worden, ze moest overleven.<br/><br/>Immers, ze werd erger geconfronteerd dan een man in een camerawinkel. Ze had eerder door haar tanden gelogen om haar leven te redden.<br/><br/>"Ik was op zoek naar een baan." Uiteindelijk was het geen complete leugen. Immers, ze was uit haar huis gegaan met de bedoeling om een sollicitatiegesprek bij te wonen. Haar staat van kleding zou op zijn minst getuigen van dat veel. Het was een van de gemakkelijkere fibs die ze ooit had verteld.<br/><br/>En om de een of andere reden heeft die gekke man haar ingehuurd.<br/><br/>かごめ<br/><br/>Kagomed rolde over in haar bed terwijl ze de verre herinneringen terug duwde en weigerde te erkennen dat ze echt wakker was. Ze klauwde bij de laatste glimpen van slaap, smeekte haar om terug te keren en haar terug te nemen in haar omhelzing. Ze sloot haar ogen, wilde slapen om te komen en werd alleen geconfronteerd met herinneringen. De echo's van een lied zong in de verte van haar herinneringen, een lied dat haar vaak had gekweld, gegeven dezelfde naam als haar. De stem die ze zong deed niet meer denken aan haar moeder, maar aan de stemmen van kinderen die ze vaak had gespeeld met opgroeien. Ze riepen de herinneringen terug, ook al was het jaren geleden dat ze dit live begon, ook al was ze gelukkig in dit leven, de oproep van deze herinneringen was te luid.<br/><br/>Plotseling viel ze terug in hen en de slaap ontkwam haar weer. Ze keek naar zichzelf in de omhelzing van haar familie, terwijl Inuyasha werd teruggetrokken in de put, kijkend zo geschrokken als ze had gevoeld. De herinneringen aan dat moment, die gevoelens, waren nog steeds zo sterk. Het gevoel van hartzeer en verdriet werd weer opgewelld, hoewel het zo lang geleden was dat ze het gevoel had dat ze was weggerukt van alles wat voor haar belangrijk was.<br/><br/>Natuurlijk was haar familie belangrijk, en ze was blij om weer in hun armen te zijn. Ze kon nooit volledig, echt beschrijven hoe ze zich in die dagen had gevoeld. Ze kon nog steeds niet uitleggen hoe ze zich in tweeën verdeeld voelde, met oorlogszuchtige verlangens om in zowel haar verleden als heden te zijn. Ze herinnerde zich de vergeefse pogingen om door de put te springen, met vingers die aan de grond klapten in een wanhopige smeekbede om haar terug te laten keren. De eerste maand thuis, ze sliep niet zo veel als ze huilde.<br/><br/>Elysion had een soortgelijke reactie gegarneerd, hoewel het niet zo hevig was omdat ze niet precies wist waar ze doorheen was gegleden, noch wist ze waar ze haar weg terug kon wormen. Haar verkenningen waren subtiel tussen het werken van haar werk en het proberen om zich te vestigen in dit leven. Ze had geen intenties om te blijven, geen intenties om langer te blijven dan ze nodig had. En hoewel ze niet zo hard probeerde als toen ze probeerde terug te keren naar het verleden, was haar passie tienvoudig omdat ze geen banden met deze wereld had. Omdat ze echt alleen was... met geen hoop dat iemand haar zou bereiken.<br/><br/>In haar irrationele momenten dacht ze dat het juweel haar had teruggetrokken en een nieuwe hel had gevonden om in te wonen. Een nieuwe hel die haar zou dwingen een wens te doen, maar ze herinnerde zich heel duidelijk dat ze het voor altijd had gewenst. Dat hield haar dromen niet tegen, de tijden dat ze 's nachts wakker werd, en die herinneringen aan haar verleden waren het moeilijkst om mee om te gaan, het moeilijkst om te vergeten. Haar hart begon te racen in paniek toen ze weer in haar bed draaide, haar adem werd een strijd terwijl ze vocht tegen een paniekaanval geïnduceerd door haar dwalende geest deze late nacht.<br/><br/>Ze haatte het om zich zo zwak, zo bang te voelen.<br/><br/>籠の中の鳥は<br/><br/>Kagome trok zich eindelijk uit bed, haar kamer verlicht met een bleek licht dat genoeg was om haar naar de badkamer te leiden. Ze stond voor de spiegel, de gootsteen liep terwijl ze naar haar reflectie staarde. Ravenkleurig haar bedekte haar gezicht en ze voelde zich net zo slecht als ze eruit zag. Haar eerste ochtend in Elysion was vergelijkbaar met dit, alleen was ze in slechtere vorm.<br/><br/>Ze had een plek gevonden om te slapen, in staat om een deal uit te werken met de eigenaar van het gebouw om haar toe te staan om een kleine periode van tijd te blijven zonder te betalen. Misschien was het de invloed van Miroku die haar in staat stelde om dergelijke deals te sluiten, omdat de monnik bekend stond om zijn manier in charmante (of scamming) mensen om hen meer dan genoeg te geven voor het werk dat ze hadden gedaan. De monnik was altijd zo geweest, sinds zij elkaar voor het eerst hadden ontmoet. Hij zou beweren dat de woning van een heer achtervolgd zou worden als het niet zo was, of hij zou beweren dat ze onderworpen waren aan een aanval als ze dat niet zouden zijn. Hij zou zijn afdelingen en bedels verkopen voor zulke hoge prijzen. Het werkte vrijwel elke keer en ze vroeg zich af waarom mensen zo bereid waren hem te vertrouwen.<br/><br/>Misschien was het zijn glimlach, of het feit dat hij een monnik was die de mensen uit het verleden zo bereid waren te verbrokkelen. Hij deed altijd wat juist was en hij was een symbool van kracht voor haar op momenten dat hij alles door zou duwen om te doen wat juist was. Hij duwde door het feit dat hij aan het sterven was, dat hij vervloekt was, en probeerde er iets aan te doen in plaats van in zijn lot te kruipen. Hij had zichzelf tot het uiterste geduwd in de tijd voorafgaand aan hun laatste strijd. En ze was blij dat ze Naraku hadden verslagen voordat hij hetzelfde lot kon ondergaan als zijn vader, en zijn vader voor hem.<br/><br/>Wat haar eigen charmes betreft, was ze echter eerlijker dan haar vriendin en maakte ze de deal redelijk. Ze betwijfelde of iedereen in deze wereld een forse prijs zou betalen voor een exorcisme of het verbannen van demonen. Ze waren daarvoor te technologisch geavanceerd. Maar ze was slim genoeg, en slim genoeg, om een goede deal te maken.<br/><br/>Maar nu was Kagome op een betere plek, hoewel de blik op haar gezicht er hetzelfde uitzag.<br/><br/>Een snelle blik op een klok op de muur vertelde haar dat ze kon proberen om langer te slapen, maar ze koos er niet voor om de flashbacks niet meer onder ogen te zien. In plaats daarvan nam ze een douche en gebruikte het koude water om haar demonen weg te jagen, om haar longen te vullen met een scherpe ademhaling en zichzelf wakker te maken.<br/><br/>いついつ出やる<br/><br/>Het werkte niet.<br/><br/>Het koude water dwong zeker de lucht in haar longen, dwong haar geest om wakker te worden en de spieren om te grijpen. Een bittere lach werd uit haar lippen getrokken toen ze haar hoofd naar achteren kantelde en zich meer herinnerde. Vandaag zou ze niet zo gemakkelijk ontsnappen, ze zou niet zo eenvoudig herstellen, om te herstellen alleen omdat ze het wilde.<br/><br/>Soms is er geen manier om de gedachten te vermijden die je wilde, zelfs niet als je er zeker van was dat je voorbij was.<br/><br/>Sango zou een grote hulp zijn geweest in deze situatie. De demon killer was haar beste vriend, ze zou zelfs zo ver gaan om haar de zus te noemen die ze nooit had. Een oudere zus die wijs was, had altijd haar kant wanneer problemen opkwamen. Vooral jongen problemen, toen dergelijke dingen waren nogal triviaal, maar het was leuk om een crush te hebben en voor haar vriend om boos te zijn namens haar toen Inuyasha maakte haar verdrietig. Immers, het was vaak dat de halve demon naar de kant van zijn dode minnaar rende en haar hart meer dan eens brak.<br/><br/>Maar Sango inspireerde haar ook op andere manieren. Na alles wat de vrouw had meegemaakt, was ze altijd zo sterk geweest, zo zeker... Zelfs in de tijden dat ze aan zichzelf had getwijfeld, trok ze altijd door. Ze bewonderde dat ze het vermogen had om te overleven nadat ze haar hele familie had verloren - de herinnering aan dit duwde Kagome vaak om te overleven, omdat ze iedereen aan deze wereld verloor - en vervolgens haar broer een pion van Naraku liet worden. Het was niet gemakkelijk, het kon niet iets zijn waar iedereen mee kon omgaan en nog steeds mee door kon gaan. Ze glimlachte nog steeds, zelfs met die pijn en die herinneringen... Ze was vaak zo helder, zelfs in de donkerste tijden.<br/><br/>En op dit moment wilde ze in de kant van de oudere vrouw leunen, om troost te krijgen in het feit dat ze er was en ze was ondersteunend. Ze voelde dat Sango hier op de een of andere manier doorheen zou trekken, en enkele woorden van kracht en begrip zou aanbieden. Het waren tijden als deze die deze spreuken verergerden, de constante herinnering dat ze zonder haar familie was.<br/><br/>"Ik wil niet alleen zijn." Ze schreeuwde luid in haar eenzaamheid, het geluid van de douche verdrinkt het pleidooi.<br/><br/>Ze was niet bang om het toe te geven.<br/><br/>夜明けの晩に<br/><br/>Nog een uur was voorbijgegaan voordat ze het had beseft. Haar huid was koud van het water en het voelde alsof ijs door haar aderen liep. Ze had zich niet gerealiseerd dat ze was begonnen te trillen totdat haar hand reikte om het water uit te schakelen en haar douche te beëindigen. Kagome zocht niet opnieuw haar eigen blik in de spiegel, in plaats daarvan gewikkelde ze zich in handdoeken en trok uit de badkamer, de trap op en in haar keuken. Ze begon met het maken van een licht ontbijt, lui lezen door haar aantekeningen voor de dag als het eten gekookt.<br/><br/>Haar carrière begon echt de laatste jaren. Haar foto's waren te zien in vele galeries, haar naam begon veel lippen te frequenteren voor degenen die geïnteresseerd waren in fotografie.<br/><br/>De baan die ze op een grillige manier had gevraagd, had het allemaal veroorzaakt. Ze was veel gelukkiger geweest dan ze had verwacht in deze wereld te zijn. Nooit geluk genoeg om terug te glippen door de scheuren in haar eigen wereld, maar geluk genoeg om het goed te doen. Toen ze naar het fornuis terugkeerde, herinnerde ze zich de tijd dat ze eindelijk was opgegeven bij haar terugkeer naar huis. Het was ongeveer twee jaar in haar leven hier, want ze was begonnen met fotografie als meer dan alleen een hobby, maar iets waarmee ze een naam kon maken.<br/><br/>Die dag was bijzonder aangenaam geweest, de zon was hoog aan de hemel en ze had zichzelf een aantal foto's van het natuurlijke landschap gevonden. Een kleine jongen had zich verstopt in een van de planten, en ze had een foto genomen van het moment waarop zijn gezicht zich in een vrolijke, ondeugende grijns had gevestigd op het moment voordat hij eruit was gesprongen om zijn prooi te schrikken. Het deed haar denken aan Shippou, de kleine kitsune die ze in wezen had geadopteerd. Hij was ook van zijn familie gescheurd toen ze elkaar voor het eerst ontmoetten. Zijn vader doodde en hij was vastbesloten om hem te wreken. Toen hij jong was, leek hij zo volwassen in hun eerste ontmoetingen.<br/><br/>Misschien was het de invloed van Inuyasha die de kit toestond om weer als een kind te handelen, om soms jong en grillig te zijn, terwijl anderen hij volwassener was. Hij bood haar troost op zijn eigen manier, en zij probeerde voor hem te zorgen zoals zij voor haarzelf zou zorgen, ook al was ze toen zo jong geweest. Haar jeugd hield haar echter niet tegen om te begrijpen hoe ze voor hem moest zorgen of voor hem moest zorgen als haar kind. Haar hart werd gezwollen toen hij glimlachte, toen hij zo blij was met zijn geschenk van potloden en de tijd had genomen om kunst te maken. Ze was zo trots op elke tekening dat hij klaar was dat ze wist dat dit was hoe een moeder zich zou voelen in een dergelijke situatie.<br/><br/>De pijn die door haar was gescheurd was te veel, te plotseling. Ze miste hem en wilde zien hoeveel hij was gegroeid sinds ze weg was. Ze had zo veel gemist...<br/><br/>Om zichzelf verdere pijn, valse hoop te besparen... gaf ze het op en concentreerde ze zich op zichzelf.<br/><br/>鶴と亀が<br/><br/>Het ontbijt smaakte zacht, saai en geïnspireerd. Pas nadat ze klaar was, realiseerde ze zich dat ze elke soort specerijen of smaak van het eten had vergeten. Het was nu te laat om zich dat te herinneren, omdat haar geest te druk was met het herinneren van andere details van haar leven die duidelijk belangrijker waren geworden dan haar voedsel.<br/><br/>Zitten.<br/><br/>Natuurlijk gebeurde er niets toen ze boos had geschreeuwd tegen een bijzonder frustrerende klant die haar aan de halfdemon herinnerde. Hij was bijzonder koppig en onbeleefd, hij wilde een foto zijn weg nemen in plaats van het op natuurlijke wijze te laten werken. Je zou kunnen proberen wilde dieren te dwingen zich te gedragen zoals je wilde. Maar, zelden lukte het iemand met geweld. Inuyasha was echter niet zo slecht. Inuyasha had geleerd voordat ze van hem was geduwd. Hij was zachter geworden, meer begrip, meer volwassen, hoewel er tijden waren dat hij nog kinderlijk en laf was.<br/><br/>Ze herinnert zich hoe rood haar wangen waren verbrand, maar hoe ze haar grond stond en hem ontsloeg. Ze vertelde hem dat ze weigerde te werken voor iedereen of met iedereen die iets wilde verdraaien dat buiten de natuur lag, buiten haar eigen verlangens.<br/><br/>Ze had de man moeten vergelijken met Naraku in plaats van Inuyasha. Hoewel haar cliënt niet zulke extreme intenties had. Tenminste het gevoel achteraf was een aangename herinnering. De vrijheid om te weten dat ze zo ver was gekomen dat ze werk kon weigeren dat ze niet wilde doen, om haar eigen persoon te zijn die onafhankelijk was van anderen. Ze kon zeggen dat ze het op dat moment maakte. Hoewel ze enkele dagen later geruchten hoorde met woorden die bedoeld waren om haar te belasteren.<br/><br/>Ze verdedigde zichzelf rechtvaardig, zoals ze tegen het einde van haar reis deed. Immers, ze was de enige die zichzelf kon beschermen in deze wereld.<br/><br/>滑った<br/><br/>Het ochtendlicht begon in haar huis te kruipen en herinnerde haar weer aan het verstrijken van de tijd. Nogmaals, ze overwogen de lijst van dingen die ze moest doen en debatteerde over waar te beginnen. Of, als ze zelfs maar moest beginnen. Met hoe de dag begon, wist ze niet of ze dat als een geweldig idee kon beschouwen. Het was twijfelachtig of ze succesvol zou zijn met hoe verloren ze in zichzelf werd.<br/><br/>Ze wilde haar nieuwste werk niet verpesten, omdat ze dat een paar keer eerder had gedaan. Het was niet prettig om te proberen te herstellen van een complete ramp.<br/><br/>Kagome herinnerde zich het gevoel van haar dure, gloednieuwe camera die uit haar handen glipte. Ze was niet bereid om het te ondersteunen, omdat ze het net uit haar tas had gehaald. Een deel van haar schreeuwde aan de binnenkant. Een dramatische, over-the-top, volle schreeuw die ze vaak deed toen ze veel, veel jonger was. Toen ze worstelde om door middel van de middelbare school te komen terwijl ze tussen de tijden sprong. Het andere deel van haar was bevroren gebleven, terwijl haar lens volledig verbrijzeld was en de rest van de camera ermee was gebroken.<br/><br/>Toen ze Inuyasha’s broer, een vol demon, voor haar zag staan, was dat het laatste wat ze verwachtte toen ze haar weg naar buiten had gemaakt voor haar foto’s. Hij stond zo trots als ooit, zo lang als ooit, zo imposant als ze zich herinnerde. Hij leek helemaal niet verlegen om in een heel andere wereld te zijn, hoewel ze nooit de beste was om zijn gedachten te lezen. Zijn naam op haar lippen was zo krachtig, dat ze zich de kleinste gevoelens kon herinneren zoals ze dat deed. Haar lippen waren geschaafd, haar mond voelde droog aan, en het borrelende gevoel van angst in haar maag maakte haar ziek.<br/><br/>Ze wilde niet dat haar hoop opkwam.<br/><br/>Maar ze wilde dat hij er was, zelfs als ze geen vrienden waren. Ze waren bondgenoten, als er iets was, omdat ze zij aan zij hadden gevochten. En iets was beter dan absoluut niets.<br/><br/>En Kagome had het gevoel zich niet naar hem te gooien, haar armen om hem te wikkelen in opluchting dat ze wist dat ze niet alleen was. Haar camera maakte niet meer uit toen ze hem naderde. Ze herinnerde zich dat niets anders belangrijk was voor dagen dat ze tijd met hem doorbracht, niet over hun wereld praatte maar sprak (of, ze sprak en hij erkende dat feit gewoon).<br/><br/>Toen, precies, ze viel voor hem, hoewel... Kagome zich niet kon herinneren. Het was een subtiel ding, net als hij was. Maar ze wist dat het gevoel er was. En hij liet haar weten dat ze niet alleen was in het feit dat ze was gevallen, dat gevoelens op de een of andere manier waren gebloemd.<br/><br/>後ろの正面<br/><br/>Een gevoel van gewichtloosheid overviel haar en plotseling openden haar ogen terwijl haar geest wanhopig klauwde voor het laatste wat ze deed. Ze herinnerde zich niet dat ze op haar bank in slaap was gevallen, maar ze wist dat de laatste plek waar ze was geweest, op de veel te comfortabele kussens was. Ze worstelde echter niet of vocht tegen de gewichtloosheid omdat ze in vertrouwde armen was. Haar hoofd draaide tegen Sesshoumaru's borst, troostend in het feit dat hij hier was en ze was niet alleen.<br/><br/>"Welkom terug." Zijn reactie was een zacht humeur in erkenning. Hij hoefde niet veel te zeggen voor haar om zijn intentie te begrijpen, of de rest van wat hij te zeggen had.<br/><br/>Hij droeg haar terug naar haar bed, legde haar er gemakkelijk in. Haar ogen ontmoetten hem en ze glimlachte gemakkelijk omdat geen herinneringen meer terug dreven, geen herinneringen meer plaagden haar. Nee, wanneer hij in de buurt was, viel ze nooit terug in die gedachten. Hij had geholpen, en de jaren hadden geholpen. Vandaag was gewoon... een van die dagen.<br/><br/>"Slaap." Hij beval met gemak, haar ogen rolden naar hem toe, maar ze vocht niet omdat ze moe was. Haar hand klampte zich strak aan hem vast, terwijl ze voelde dat zijn tegenovergestelde hand naar haar voorhoofd drukte om haar welzijn te beoordelen.<br/><br/>"Ik ben in orde," zei ze, haar woorden vasthoudend aan haar belofte.<br/><br/>Ze was in orde, ze leefde nog en ze was gelukkig.<br/><br/>だあれ<br/><br/>Verlader<br/><br/>samenvatting<br/><br/>Kagome, op een gegeven moment in haar leven, was een vrij regelmatig tienermeisje totdat ze werd aangevallen door een demon in het huis van haar familie put. De demon sleepte haar naar beneden in de put, die haar op magische wijze vervoerde ongeveer 500 jaar in het verleden. Daar leerde ze dat er een heilig juweel in haar lichaam was omhuld, omdat ze de reïncarnatie was van een priesteres die 50 jaar voor de tijd dat ze werd meegesleurd was gestorven. Het juweel werd uit haar lichaam gescheurd en de demon die haar door de tijd sleepte, werd verslagen door de halve demon die ze bevrijdde, die aan de boom vastgebonden was. Kagome bevriend met de half-demon, Inuyasha, in de tijd en reisde met hem om het juweel te herstellen dat zij, zelf, verbrijzeld. Hoewel het was niet zo eenvoudig en gemakkelijk te doen als veel demonen en mensen zochten naar het juweel voor hun eigen doeleinden. Ze bevriend een jonge kitsune demon, een monnik, en een demon moordenaar die allemaal reisde met haar om het juweel te herstellen.<br/><br/>Haar groep was echter niet degene die het juweel voltooide, in plaats daarvan een kwade halfdemon die de meeste grote gebeurtenissen in het grootste deel van het leven van haar metgezel manipuleerde. Toen hij uiteindelijk alle stukken van het juweel verzamelde en zijn wens deed op het verontreinigde object, werd Kagome in het juweel zelf getrokken met de bedoeling dat ze een egoïstische wens zou maken om haar voor altijd binnen te houden en het juweel in leven te houden. Het was de koppigheid van Inuyasha die erin slaagde haar te redden van de duisternis. Uiteindelijk keerde ze terug naar haar natuurlijke tijd, voltooide de middelbare school zoals verwacht van een meisje van haar tijdlijn. Hoewel dagen later, Kagome eindigde in Elysion. Ze is al vijf jaar in deze wereld, en heeft al lang opgegeven om naar huis terug te keren. Ze heeft zich gelukkig gevestigd in haar nieuwe leven.<br/><br/>Platonisch<br/><br/>Het is vrij gemakkelijk voor Kagome om nieuwe vrienden te maken, ze heeft niet veel veranderd van haar jeugd. Ze is een vrolijke jonge vrouw die empathisch en gastvrij is voor het meest van alles in haar leven. In haar jeugd bevriend ze demonen toen de meesten zouden ze vrezen. Zelfs demonen die vroeger mensen aten, heeft ze bevriend geraakt en ze veranderde hun manieren (ze zou willen denken). Dat gezegd hebbende, is het heel gemakkelijk om haar vriend te worden, zolang iemand in staat is om te laten zien dat ze bereid zijn om verlost te worden, of om te laten zien dat ze niet helemaal slecht zijn. Ze voelt veel voor iedereen die ze ontmoet, dus het is moeilijk voor haar om niet aangetrokken te worden tot anderen in een verlangen om vrienden te zijn.<br/><br/>antagonistisch<br/><br/>De enige manier om Kagome's toorn te verdienen is om zo ellendig, zo kwaadaardig en zo ver voorbij de verlossing te zijn dat ze geen goed in je kan zien. En ze kan het goede zien in vrijwel iedereen en alles. Eerlijk gezegd, met wie ze is geconfronteerd? Een halve demon die twee minnaars tegen elkaar aanzette, die de hele mannelijke lijn van een van haar vrienden vervloekte, en vervolgens de broer van haar beste vriend hun familie liet vermoorden... Voel je vrij om het een schot te geven.<br/><br/>romantiek<br/><br/>Als ze verliefd is, is Kagome een sterke steun, altijd daar blijvend, zelfs wanneer de dingen ruw kunnen zijn. Kagome is echter niet op zoek naar liefde, was niet op zoek naar liefde toen ze aankwam, dus geen eerdere relaties bestaan. Dit wil niet zeggen dat iemand niet verliefd op haar is geworden. Ze kan zeker het onderwerp zijn van iemands onbeantwoorde liefde, ze zal er waarschijnlijk echter niet op letten. Ten slotte is Kagome momenteel verloofd met Sesshoumaru, verrassend.

Neptunus probeert zichzelf zeker te omringen met mensen, omdat hij het leuk vindt om vrienden te hebben, en kagome is ook zo ongeveer zijn type? zoals ze lief is en ze is een sterke vrouw, en hij is eigenlijk betere vrienden met vrouwen dan hij is met mannen, idk waarom, hij houdt er gewoon van omringd te worden door vrouwelijke vrienden die het weten. Ik hou van mijn jongens zijn super goede vrienden en het beschermen van hun meisje vrienden eerlijk. maar oh M A N ik hou van pseduo-familie-type relaties en neptunus is een enig kind, dus hij heeft geen dergelijke, familiale relaties als dat. dus haar op zoek naar hem alle grote zus zou hem willen maken als ????? omdat hij is verward, maar ook hij eigenlijk echt houdt van dat LOL! ze zijn allebei goede kinderen, ik denk dat ze echt leuk zou zijn ^^<br/><br/>Fandom vuur embleem: lot<br/><br/>Ninth-leeftijd<br/><br/>Soort Deel mens / deel draak<br/><br/>Beroepsvertegenwoordiger voogd<br/><br/>geeft de voorkeur aan<br/><br/>prijsuitreiking<br/><br/>daar zij/haar aest 20 posts<br/><br/>Ik heb Inuyasha helemaal niet gezien, maar... van wat ik heb gelezen lijkt Kagome een van die mensen te zijn die Corrin misschien kunnen helpen met haar emotionele toestand. Ze moest haar geboortegezin tegen haar wil bestrijden en de laatste keer dat ze ze zag, haatten ze haar bijna allemaal. Eerlijk gezegd heeft ze nog niet alles doorgemaakt sinds ze in wezen aan het hoofd stond van een grootschalige oorlog. Ik heb het gevoel dat ze vrienden kunnen zijn omdat Corrin vrij open is in haar persoonlijkheid, ook extreem vertrouwend. Ze verstopt zich en worstelt veel.

Ik hou van je idee van Kagome het nemen van een foto van Elsa! Weet je, ze is ook een zangeres / performer in een lokaal theater, dus ik kan me voorstellen dat Kagome daar naar buiten gaat om dingen te onderzoeken en dan Elsa achter het podium of zoiets te vangen - en dan kan de vriendschap vanaf daar bloeien!

| Why You Should be on Twitter<br/><br/>Disclaimer: I am not, nor have I ever claimed to be, a social media guru. I'm just a person who thinks about stuff a lot, and this has come up a number of times.<br/><br/>I'm not an early adopter. Sometimes it takes me years to figure out what I want to use something for before I actually get on it, and Twitter was one of those things. I've been on Twitter seriously since about February of this year, so I'm pretty new at it. Still, I've learned a number of things, and I wanted to share them. Some people say I'm a Twitter pusher, and I am, because there's lots of good reasons to get on it, and virtually no downsides.<br/><br/>So what's Twitter? If you're on the internet, you've probably at least heard of it. It's a social media network that serves as a forum for conversations, updates, and news in a medium more public than something like Facebook or LinkedIn. Facebook is about who wants to find you, but Twitter is about who you want to find. Your favourite writers, actors, politicians, singers, and scientists are probably on Twitter. So are your favourite charities, radio stations, news sites, and stores. And they want you to find them and listen to what they have to say. Everyone on Twitter, at least initially, wants to talk with you.<br/><br/>But why join that? Why be a part of it? There's all kinds of reasons, and I'm going to give you a few.<br/><br/>People and Places Twitter is a great way to find out about events which are going on around the world, but also in your community. If you're travelling and looking for things to do, it's a great way to find out about things relevant to your interests (because the people you follow are people you're interested in). Even if you're not travelling, knowing about great places to go locally or knowing that people you're interested in are going to them creates an opportunity to meet them and create a deeper relationship with them. If you go back to my party post, all the people in it but two, I heard about on Twitter and then met in real life, and now we're pretty good friends. And the more you do this, the more things you'll find out about, and the more people you'll meet. And if you follow them on Twitter, you already know a bit about what they're like. They want you to. The reverse is also true, because tweeting invites people to see what you're like, and they can make the same choices about you.<br/><br/>Inspiration and Motivation<br/>Inspiration comes from the strangest places, and the influx of tweets means there's always fresh content for your imagination. I have a follow first policy, so I'll follow just about anybody, and then periodically go through and unfollow people. I don't know who's going to plant the seed of a new blog post or new project in me, so I like to keep my options open. Motivation also happens, because Twitter is just like life. If you surround yourself with people who are ambitious, dedicated, generous, and hard-working, it's easier to be like that, and push yourself. It's easier to think that if they can plan events, launch projects, or just get up in the morning, well, so can you.<br/><br/>Learning and Lifestyle Bloggers are on Twitter. Bloggers who aren't may actually be crazy. And people blog about just about everything. If you're looking to learn something, odds are good that somebody's tweeting about it. On top of that, news services and stores are also connected, which means that you can get your news up to the minute, and find out about sales and deals as they start.As far as lifestyle, looking for new recipe ideas? Follow some caterers and see what they come up with. Need a twist for that cocktail party? Twitter's got people for that too. Wardrobe recommendations, or just want to see what other people are doing with their lives? It's all there.<br/><br/>There are some common challenges I face when talking about this, and they're legitimate obstacles. It can seem pretty daunting, especially if you're getting on the bandwagon late, like I did. I spent months following only two people and not knowing what else to do. But there are ways to overcome them, and hear they are from least frequent to most.<br/><br/>#3: Twitter is for Narcissistic Jerks<br/>I think this comes from the idea that most people tweet for and about themselves as a way of getting attention. What I don't get is why there's anything wrong with that, or why doing that makes one a narcissist or a jerk. If someone has something to say, they want to be heard. Used to be you'd stand on the street corner and yell. Now you can yell in 140 characters or less. Twitter's just a new way to be heard. Now, there are certainly narcissistic jerks on Twitter. They're pretty much everywhere. Sometimes, people are jerks. Sometimes one of those people is me, I'm sorry to say. Don't follow those people. If you don't like what someone is saying, whether that's points that they're making or detailed accounts of their bathroom activities, you don't have to listen on Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: I Can't Keep Track of It All<br/>The second obstacle people often bring up is that they just don't have time to keep track of all the things which are going on on Twitter. And you know what? That's fine. Keep track of what you can. Maybe you only wander on every few days. If you're a private user (rather than tweeting for your company), and especially a beginner, that's okay. Part of something is better than all of nothing.<br/><br/>#1 I've Got Nothing I Want to Put Out There<br/>This is by far the most frequent challenge people raise. And it doesn't even matter. You don't have to join Twitter to talk. Join it to listen. Again, your favourite authors, singers, bloggers, and newspapers are on here. This is your chance to listen to them. It's your chance to gain a window into their lives and activities, and they're inviting you to do that. Want to find out what Felicia Day is going to be up to at the San Diego Comic Con? Done. I know people who only listen on Twitter, and that's great. That's what I did for a while. Eventually, maybe you'll find something to tweet about, or make something to tweet about. I hope you do, because I want to hear about it.<br/><br/>In short, if you're not using Twitter, I think you should be. If you're not using it to its full extent, try to. Don't be afraid to follow five hundred people, if all of those people are saying things you're interested in. Invite those people into bits of your life, and see how it's improved by the interaction. I look forward to hearing from you. | Waarom je op Twitter zou moeten zijn<br/><br/>Disclaimer: Ik ben geen goeroe op sociale media, en ik heb ook nooit beweerd dat ik een goeroe op sociale media ben. Ik ben gewoon een persoon die veel nadenkt over dingen, en dit is een aantal keren opgekomen.<br/><br/>Ik ben geen early adopter. Soms kost het me jaren om erachter te komen waarvoor ik iets wil gebruiken voordat ik er daadwerkelijk op ga, en Twitter was een van die dingen. Ik ben sinds ongeveer februari van dit jaar serieus op Twitter geweest, dus ik ben er vrij nieuw in. Toch heb ik een aantal dingen geleerd, en ik wilde ze delen. Sommige mensen zeggen dat ik een Twitter pusher ben, en dat ben ik, omdat er veel goede redenen zijn om eraan te beginnen, en vrijwel geen nadelen.<br/><br/>Dus wat is Twitter? Als je op het internet bent, heb je er waarschijnlijk op zijn minst van gehoord. Het is een sociaal netwerk dat dient als een forum voor gesprekken, updates en nieuws in een medium dat meer openbaar is dan iets als Facebook of LinkedIn. Facebook gaat over wie je wilt vinden, maar Twitter gaat over wie je wilt vinden. Je favoriete schrijvers, acteurs, politici, zangers en wetenschappers zijn waarschijnlijk op Twitter. Ook je favoriete liefdadigheidsinstellingen, radiostations, nieuwssites en winkels. En ze willen dat je ze vindt en luistert naar wat ze te zeggen hebben. Iedereen op Twitter, in ieder geval in het begin, wil met je praten.<br/><br/>Er zijn allerlei redenen om mee te doen, en ik geef je er een paar.<br/><br/>Mensen en Plaatsen Twitter is een geweldige manier om meer te weten te komen over evenementen die over de hele wereld plaatsvinden, maar ook in uw gemeenschap. Als je op reis bent en op zoek bent naar dingen om te doen, is het een geweldige manier om te weten te komen over dingen die relevant zijn voor je interesses (omdat de mensen die je volgt mensen zijn die je interesseert). Zelfs als je niet reist, creëert het kennen van geweldige plaatsen om lokaal te gaan of te weten dat mensen waar je in geïnteresseerd bent naar hen toe gaan, een kans om hen te ontmoeten en een diepere relatie met hen te creëren. Als je teruggaat naar mijn feestpost, alle mensen erin behalve twee, ik hoorde erover op Twitter en ontmoette ze toen in het echte leven, en nu zijn we vrij goede vrienden. En hoe meer je dit doet, hoe meer dingen je zult ontdekken, en hoe meer mensen je zult ontmoeten. En als je ze op Twitter volgt, weet je al een beetje hoe ze zijn. Ze willen dat je dat doet. Het omgekeerde is ook waar, omdat twitteren mensen uitnodigt om te zien hoe je bent, en ze dezelfde keuzes over je kunnen maken.<br/><br/>Inspiratie en motivatie<br/>Inspiratie komt van de vreemdste plaatsen, en de toestroom van tweets betekent dat er altijd verse inhoud is voor je verbeelding. Ik heb een volgend beleid, dus ik zal bijna iedereen volgen, en dan periodiek doorlopen en mensen niet volgen. Ik weet niet wie het zaad van een nieuwe blogpost of nieuw project in mij gaat planten, dus ik hou mijn opties graag open. Motivatie gebeurt ook, omdat Twitter net als het leven is. Als je jezelf omringt met mensen die ambitieus, toegewijd, genereus en hardwerkend zijn, is het gemakkelijker om zo te zijn en jezelf te pushen. Het is makkelijker om te denken dat als ze evenementen kunnen plannen, projecten kunnen lanceren, of gewoon 's ochtends opstaan, nou ja, dat kan jij ook.<br/><br/>Leren en Lifestyle Bloggers zijn op Twitter. Bloggers die dat niet zijn, kunnen eigenlijk gek zijn. En mensen bloggen over bijna alles. Als je iets wilt leren, zijn de kansen goed dat iemand erover twittert. Bovendien zijn nieuwsdiensten en winkels ook verbonden, wat betekent dat u uw nieuws tot op de minuut kunt krijgen en meer te weten kunt komen over verkoop en deals als ze beginnen. Wat betreft levensstijl, op zoek naar nieuwe receptideeën? Volg een paar cateraars en zie wat ze bedenken. Heb je een draai nodig voor dat cocktailfeest? Twitter heeft daar ook mensen voor. Kledingkastaanbevelingen, of wil je gewoon zien wat andere mensen met hun leven doen? Het is er allemaal.<br/><br/>Er zijn een aantal gemeenschappelijke uitdagingen waar ik mee te maken heb, en het zijn legitieme obstakels. Het kan behoorlijk ontmoedigend lijken, vooral als je laat in de bandwagon stapt, zoals ik deed. Ik heb maanden doorgebracht met het volgen van slechts twee mensen en niet wetende wat anders te doen, maar er zijn manieren om ze te overwinnen, en te horen dat ze van de minste tot de meeste komen.<br/><br/># 3: Twitter is voor narcistische eikels<br/>Ik denk dat dit komt van het idee dat de meeste mensen tweeten voor en over zichzelf als een manier om aandacht te krijgen. Wat ik niet begrijp is waarom er iets mis is met dat, of waarom het doen van dat maakt een narcist of een eikel. Als iemand iets te zeggen heeft, willen ze gehoord worden. Vroeger stond je op de hoek en schreeuwde. Nu kun je schreeuwen in 140 tekens of minder. Twitter is gewoon een nieuwe manier om gehoord te worden. Nu zijn er zeker narcistische eikels op Twitter. Ze zijn bijna overal. Soms zijn mensen eikels. Soms ben ik een van die mensen, sorry om te zeggen. Volg die mensen niet. Als je niet bevalt wat iemand zegt, of dat nu punten zijn die ze maken of gedetailleerde verslagen van hun badkameractiviteiten, hoef je niet te luisteren op Twitter.<br/><br/>#2: Ik kan niet alles bijhouden<br/>Het tweede obstakel dat mensen vaak naar voren brengen, is dat ze gewoon geen tijd hebben om bij te houden van alle dingen die er op Twitter gaande zijn. En weet je wat? Dat is prima. Houd bij wat je kunt. Misschien dwaal je maar om de paar dagen. Als je een privégebruiker bent (in plaats van te tweeten voor je bedrijf), en vooral een beginner, is dat prima. Een deel van iets is beter dan niets.<br/><br/># 1 Ik heb niets dat ik wil er uit te zetten<br/>Dit is veruit de meest voorkomende uitdaging die mensen oproepen. En het maakt niet eens uit. Je hoeft je niet aan te sluiten bij Twitter om te praten. Doe mee om te luisteren. Nogmaals, je favoriete auteurs, zangers, bloggers en kranten zijn hier op. Dit is je kans om naar hen te luisteren. Het is je kans om een venster te krijgen op hun leven en activiteiten, en ze nodigen je uit om dat te doen. Wil je weten wat Felicia Day gaat worden op de San Diego Comic Con? Klaar. Ik ken mensen die alleen op Twitter luisteren, en dat is geweldig. Dat heb ik een tijdje gedaan. Misschien vind je uiteindelijk iets om over te tweeten, of maak je iets om over te tweeten. Ik hoop dat je dat doet, want ik wil erover horen.<br/><br/>Kortom, als je Twitter niet gebruikt, denk ik dat je dat moet zijn. Als je het niet volledig gebruikt, probeer het dan. Wees niet bang om vijfhonderd mensen te volgen, als al die mensen dingen zeggen waarin je geïnteresseerd bent. Nodig die mensen uit in stukjes van je leven, en zie hoe het wordt verbeterd door de interactie. Ik kijk ernaar uit om van je te horen. |
| Root Canals<br/><br/>The very thought of getting a root canal puts most people on edge. SCM Dental utilizes the latest technology and technique to make a root canal a virtually pain free and low stress procedure.<br/><br/>Rotary endodontics is an advanced technology and technique to perform endodontic treatment, the clinical term for a root canalThe term "root canal" refers to the natural cavity at the center of the tooth. The tooth's nerve is located in soft tissue (pulp) inside the root canal. If the tooth is damaged either by trauma or decay, debris can enter the sensitive root canal area and cause an infection, or in extreme circumstances, and abscess. An abscessed tooth is very serious and should be treated as an emergency, as it can create an infection that may spread to other parts of the body. If you believe you have an abscessed tooth, contact our office immediately to schedule emergency care.<br/><br/>Depending on the case, root canal therapy may require more than one visit. An initial x-ray will be taken to evaluate the tooth and root canal and determine the extent of the damage and infection if present. You will be given a form of anesthesia to make you relaxed.<br/><br/>When the area is numb, our dentist will create an access chamber to the root canal using an electric handpiece. Next, the root canal will be scraped of the infected or damaged tissue and nerve. Once the entire area has been throughly cleaned and polished, the tooth will be filled with a biocompatible rubber compound called gutta percha. The tooth is then covered with a dental filling or dental crown to restore strength and function.<br/><br/>Endodontic therapy has a bad reputation as being a painful procedure. With rotary endodontics, a root canal procedure is no more painful than having a dental filling placed. The infection and damage to the nerve is what creates the extreme pain and discomfort and patients you will experience significant relief after undergoing root canal therapy. Root canals have a success rate of 95% and allow people to preserve their natural teeth. | Root Canals<br/><br/>SCM Dental maakt gebruik van de nieuwste technologie en techniek om van een wortelkanaal een vrijwel pijnvrije en stressvrije procedure te maken.<br/><br/>Roterende endodontie is een geavanceerde technologie en techniek om endodontische behandeling uit te voeren, de klinische term voor een wortelkanaalDe term "wortelkanaal" verwijst naar de natuurlijke holte in het centrum van de tand. De zenuw van de tand bevindt zich in zacht weefsel (pulp) in het wortelkanaal. Als de tand beschadigd is door trauma of bederf, kan puin het gevoelige wortelkanaalgebied binnendringen en een infectie veroorzaken, of in extreme omstandigheden en abces. Een abcestoor is zeer ernstig en moet worden behandeld als een noodgeval, omdat het een infectie kan veroorzaken die zich naar andere delen van het lichaam kan verspreiden. Als u denkt dat u een abcestoor hebt, neem dan onmiddellijk contact op met ons kantoor om spoedeisende hulp in te plannen.<br/><br/>Afhankelijk van het geval, kan wortelkanaaltherapie meer dan één bezoek vereisen. Een eerste röntgenfoto zal worden genomen om het tand- en wortelkanaal te evalueren en de omvang van de schade en infectie te bepalen indien aanwezig. Je krijgt een vorm van anesthesie om je te ontspannen.<br/><br/>Wanneer het gebied gevoelloos is, zal onze tandarts een toegangskamer tot het wortelkanaal maken met behulp van een elektrisch handstuk. Vervolgens zal het wortelkanaal worden geschraapt van het geïnfecteerde of beschadigde weefsel en zenuw. Zodra het hele gebied grondig is gereinigd en gepolijst, wordt de tand gevuld met een biocompatibele rubbersamenstelling genaamd gutta percha. De tand wordt vervolgens bedekt met een tandvulling of tandkroon om kracht en functie te herstellen.<br/><br/>Endodontische therapie heeft een slechte reputatie als een pijnlijke procedure. Bij roterende endodontie is een wortelkanaalprocedure niet pijnlijker dan het hebben van een tandheelkundige vulling geplaatst. De infectie en schade aan de zenuw is wat de extreme pijn en ongemak veroorzaakt en patiënten zullen aanzienlijke verlichting ervaren na het ondergaan van wortelkanaaltherapie. Rootkanalen hebben een succespercentage van 95% en stellen mensen in staat om hun natuurlijke tanden te behouden. |
| Churchyard Bottom Wood<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Churchyard Bottom Wood, Highgate<br/><br/>Now called Queen's Wood<br/><br/>Between 1860 and 1880 the centre was torn out of the City of London to build sewers, railways and new roads. Houses were demolished without regard for the tenants who had to find whatever accommodation they could elsewhere. Managers went to livo in Kensington and St. John's Wood, while the poorest crowded into the rookeries like Seven Dials and Lisson Grove. For those between, the clerks and skilled workmen, speculative builders put up row after row of terraced villas and Mr Pooter moved into Holloway. The people of Muswell Hill watched houses creep across the fields of Finsbury Park, up Crouch Hill and down the other side, so that by 1880, Crouch End was being developed and there seemed no way to stem the flow. Ten years later the large estates of Muswell Hill were being sold. Upton Farm was sold and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to develop Churchyard Bottom Wood, now called Queen's Wood. The story would have made an Ibsen play. Two groups of honest, highly motivated people fighting for what they each thought was right. The Ecclesiastical Commissioners on the one hand and the Committee of the Hornsey Charities on the other, both believed they were doing their best for other people, and the public rose against them both in indignation<br/><br/>At that time Muswell Hill Road was a country road, with Southwood Hall at one end and Upton Farm at the other. By 1894, Onslow Gardens was built, Connaught Gardens marked out, and builders were poised to develop the Woodlands estate. Cut out of Churchyard Bottom Wood was a group of tumble-down cottages, on a triangular site. An undated map, held by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners shows six Wasteland Cottages with an opening between them - not a road, not metalled, but a way through to the strawberry beds behind. Further along was another gap which led to footpaths through the wood. These two openings were to be the basis of the plan. The same two gaps and the cleared ground, which was the strawberry field, can be seen in the 1894 map below. They are shown as 'Muswell Hill Cottages' and, quite in passing, Peter Sellers was to live on the same site much later on. To develop the wood as a housing estate, the Commissioners needed to drive two roads through from Muswell Hill Road and build houses along them. The Muswell Hill Road frontage alone would not have provided room for enough houses to make the venture worthwhile.<br/><br/>The land and cottages had been given much earlier as almshouses to house old people and were held on their behalf by the Trustees of the Hornsey Charity Commissioners. By the 1890s the cottages were tumble-down, in need of major repair. Public-spirited, wishing to do the best for their old tenants, the Trustees could not improve them since they had no money. Some years before the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had planned to develop Gravel Pit Wood (now Highgate Wood) as a housing estate, but this had met such opposition that they backed down. Instead, in 1886, they gave all 69 acres woodland to the public. At the same time they offered to sell Churchyard Bottom Wood to Hornsey Urban District Council for £25,000, but this was too much for Hornsey to raise on its own. The Council said that people living outside Hornsey also enjoyed the wood and other authorities should help, but no help was given. In the end the offer fell into abeyance.<br/><br/>Map showing the Muswell Hill Cottages which were the centre of the controversy.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road about 1880<br/><br/>It seems probable that these three pairs of cottages<br/>were the ones at the centre of the dispute.<br/><br/>The Ecclesiastical Commissioners wanted to raise money for its church work in Britain and abroad. They considered that they had been given the land to be used for the propogat­ion of religion and if this meant selling off land or woods, it was a lesser evil than restricting the work of the church. They had given Gravel Pit Wood to the public: in its place they would develop Churchyard Bottom Wood.<br/><br/>The Trustees of the Hornsey Charities wanted to produce an income to help their poor people, so they made an offer to the Commissioners. Their triangular piece of land was too awkwardly shaped to be developed economically, but if the Commissioners would grant them some more land to make it into a square site, they would build twenty-five neat villas. These would bring in ground rents of £225 per annum, which could be used to relieve the poverty of Hornsey people. In return they would permit the Commission­ers to cut two roads through their land so that the Commissioners could develop the woods.<br/><br/>When this offer became known people immediately reacted with alarm.<br/><br/>On the 16th December 1893 Mr Carvell Williams MP asked in the House of Commons, if the Ecclesiastical Commissioners had consented to sell a strip of land to the Hornsey Charities Trustees on condition that an existing road be widened to 40 feet, whether this was a preliminary to a building scheme and if the House of Parliament would have an opportunity to express an opinion.<br/><br/>Mr Leveson Gower, a Church Estates Commissioner replied',"Yes" to the first part.<br/><br/>Mr Carvell Williams, "Do I understand it is the intention to destroy that portion of Highgate Woods by building on it?"<br/><br/>Two days later The Star published an article worthy of any modern tabloid.<br/><br/>The Star<br/>18th December 1893<br/><br/>'Parliament must keep a keen watch on those old vandals and confederates of the jerry-builder the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. They are always alienating some piece of land or are favouring the builders as opposed to the general public. The Commissioners would not sell the Churchyard Bottom wood to the ratepayers but now propose 'to open it up' by cutting two wide roads through it in connection with one of their numerous building schemes. Will not someone ask a question in Parliament and check the brick and mortar policy of the Commissioners?'<br/><br/>By the time this was printed, the question had been asked and the answer was either untrue, or devious. Other papers took up the story. The Times, in a long report, said that the Comnussioners were not prepared to give an undertaking that Parliament, or any other public body, should have an opportunity of considering any scheme for building on the site of the wood.<br/><br/>The situation simmered for eighteen months until the Ecclesiastical Commissioners were forced to open an enquiry, which began at Highgate on 31 May 1895, chaired by an Assistant Ecclesiastical Commissioner. The Inquiry produced a flurry of newspaper letters of which this was the most important.<br/><br/>The Daily Chronicle, 5 June 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISM AT HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Sir –<br/><br/>One of the most lovely bits of woodland in suburan London is threatened. Will you help us to ward off what would be a calamity, not only to the immediate district, but to the whole of densely-populated North London? In no part of the metropolis has the builder been more active than in Crouch End and Hornsey. The beautiful meadows of a year or two ago are now houses and shops. Ballast heaps have taken the place of stately elms and chestnuts, and once pleasant villages are sharing the fate of Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury and Islington. ---<br/><br/>---- The object is the construction of two forty-foot roads through the woods. We in this district know the meaning of forty-foot roads through woods. It means that the woods are doomed. Ten years ago agitation saved the sister-wood of sixty-five acres - The Gravel Pit Woods - and no one who saw the Bank Holiday crowds flocking up the Archway Road from the dreary streets of Holloway, Islington and Clerkenwell, and watched the keen enjoyment of the children and family parties picnicking on the grass and among the trees, could fail to realise the immense boon that the grant by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners of this wood has been to the whole of North London, but the Lower Wood of sixty acres has always been regarded as a natural complement of the other. ----<br/><br/>--- The Ecclesiastical Commissioners own nearly one-third of the large parish of Hornsey. By the liberal expenditure of the ratepayers' money in the opening up of roads and the general development of the district, the value of their property has been enormously increased, and from this unearned increment they each year draw large revenues. Surely the ratepayers whose money has thus aided in creating the immense estate may expect liberal treatment in return. ---<br/><br/>Yours obediently,<br/><br/>Signed by The Vicar of St James', Muswell Hill, the Minister of Park Chapel, Crouch End, a barrister living in Onslow Gardens and three members of the District Council.<br/><br/>It was a shot right across the bows of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. Their own religious leaders and the District Council, all up in arms saying in effect that the church was too rich and should be charitable, not greedy. The inclusion of the two clergymen was a shrewd move. Remember to that this was still in the height of the Darwin controversy. Darwin had split belief in the teachings of the Church and many people would have resented the power of the Church from that point of view alone. The Church was not so secure as it pretended to be.<br/><br/>The Evening News, 7 June 1895 said:-<br/><br/>"If the Ecclesiastical Comnussioners are not tackled at once, the building octopus will get a grip of the wood which will be very difficult to loosen later on, ---. Therefore it behoves Londoners to be up and doing if they would save one of their most delightful bits of rustic scenery. The public inquiry stands adjourned to Thursday next, and before then something must be done to convince the Commissioners that the citizens of London will not tolerate the confiscation of one of their favourite playgrounds."<br/><br/>A letter in the Daily Chronicle the next day said:-<br/><br/>.... It was with great relief that that the residents, some ten years ago, heard that the purchase of the Upper Wood had been effected; and how delightful a boon this has proved, anyone who visited them can testify, but all who exerted themselves to save these upper woods, which lie on the west side of Muswell Hill road, felt that their victory was incomplete so long as the sixty acres on the east side remained in danger. It is, as it were, an accident that the woods are divided by a broad high road. Can anyone doubt what the effect would be if the Churchyard Bottom Wood were replaced by rows of small villas, each sending out its contribution of smoke and soot? Can anyone doubt, too, the serious difference it would make to the picturesque setting of the purchased woods if a line of staring new houses were to be run up right over against their leafy frontage?'<br/><br/>This expressed the opinions of many people. In fact, the Gravel Pit Wood, which the writer calls the 'Upper Wood', had not been purchased, but given to the district by the Ecclesiastical Commission, a point they were to reiterate time and again over the years, but most people ignored it. The Commission was not going to give away a second wood whatever anyone said, and held this position to the end.<br/><br/>H.S.Chamberlain, of 5 Cranley Gardens,<br/>in a letter to the Times dated June 8, 1895, urged purchase.<br/><br/>I know that it is common to speak harshly of the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, but as the trustees of a fund they are bound to administer it to the greatest advantage, and therefore, if anything is to be done to save the demolition of the wood, it appears to me that it can only be effected by the purchase of the property from the Comnussioners, who I know, are fully alive to the protection of free and open spaces for the people, and who, I feel sure, would be disposed to treat the matter of a purchase in a free and liberal spirit, as they have already done in the matter of the Shepherd's Cot-field, by granting a lease to the Crouch End Playing-fields Company - a small company in which I own a few shares, a small company which was formed exclusively for the purpose of securing the fields for cricket, tennis etc.<br/><br/>(This refers the the Crouch End Playing Fields which had been secured a few years later.)<br/><br/>As Chairman of the Muswell Hill Conservative Association, I am constantly in touch with the inhabitants, and I can safely affirm that every person resident in the neighbourhood would do anything in reason to preserve.<br/><br/>(All he wanted personally was Charity income to support his poor people. He demanded his acre of land - not a great deal surely - he believed the Commissioners' assurance that the wood was not in danger.)<br/><br/>' Muswell Hill Road was one of the best in Hornsey and would remain equally beautiful, houses or no houses',<br/><br/>(and then came the great rhetorical flourish.)<br/><br/>'Are the poor to suffer because of the sentimental objections and the hysterical cry of 'wolf just raised by your correspondents? Something must be done and that soon. An acre of back-land added to the charity-estate would make no apprec­iable difference to the land remaining, while the profit derived from it would succour many poor old and deserving persons in their declining years and enable us to hand over to our successors an estate which in the distant future would be of great value in the rendering of charitable aid to the deserving poor of the parish of Hornsey.'<br/><br/>Reading his letter one senses hysteria very near the surface. Why did he think the Commissioners wanted to build a road? Why should they spend all that money if not to build houses? He never seemed to realise that for an acre of land the the whole wood would be lost. But he had been with the problem for a long time. He was the person to whom the Commissioners had made the offer of sale for £25,000 years before and it is his name which is honoured in a plaque on Crouch End Clock Tower for saving the wood, but his trust in the Ecclesiastical Commissioners seems naive. It is sad that at the Inquiry he was to be cast as the devil.<br/><br/>The Inquiry Continued<br/><br/>The adjourned opened in Highgate on 15 June 1895. Expecting a large gather­ing, the Council Chamber had been changed completely. The usual tables had been removed and the room filled with chairs. By half past seven the room was crowded, with people jostling for seats.<br/><br/>Mr Murray, the Commissioner, said the Inquiry was really a simple one. Hornsey Parochial Charities wished to purchase a piece of land adjoining their charity property at the back. The question was whether the Charity Commission, which controlled all charities, had enough power to stop them. The Church Commissioners were prepared to sell the land at very favourable terms and the income of the Charity would be very considerable increased.<br/><br/>Against this there were three classes of objection.<br/><br/>The original Trust was for the purpose of providing cottages for the Poor, but the trustees were proposing to build villas which would be too expensive for the Poor. However, it was within the power of the Trustees to vary the terms of the Trust, so they could build villas if they thought that the Poor would benefit in the end. The poor people themselves might object, but liberal provisions had already been promised for them. The third objection related to the aesthetic and public side of the question. He took it from what he had read that the Charity Commission ought to interfere to prevent the Ecclesiastical Commissioners from exercising their own discretion in dealing with their own property.<br/><br/>The Inquiry discussed fine points, but the speakers kept coming back to the major problem of preventing any destruction of the wood. The Vestry Clerk of Islington, representing 300,000 people, made a formal protest about any part of the wood, so valuable for the people of Islington and Hornsey being used for private purposes. Mr Wilfred White said that if the Commissioners would give them time they would be able to raise the money to compensate the Trustees.<br/><br/>Mr Beaumont said they did not want villas, they wanted cottages for poor people who were being driven out of the district. Others said that there was no money to build cottages to replace the present delapidated ones but villas would be an economic proposition. Others retorted that there were score of villas to let in Highgate. The Wood was sacred. Stick to the question of the Wood.<br/><br/>Dr Fletcher said the cry among the working people was that there was nowhere to go. Working people came to him with the cry, "We are driven out of Highgate and are obliged to go to Highgate New Town." If the Muswell Hill Road frontage was sold there was no question but that roads might be cut right through the woods in the direction of Hornsey, but if the Commissioners could not get the land from the Charity Commission they could not cut the road.<br/><br/>He was very sure the cottages could be put into a fit state of repair. He was asked by the poor people, by the police and by a number of the working classes to represent these two points, that cottage accommodation was very sorely needed in Highgate and that if they once allowed the land to be sold, there was no telling where the hand of the builder would be stayed.<br/><br/>(Loud and prolonged cheers).<br/><br/>Numerous other people spoke and the Comnussioner summed up by saying that he took it that the prevailing opinion was in favour of retaining the cottages but the meeting should draw no conclusions from what he had said (Groans).<br/><br/>Others said that the Trustees of the Charity had failed in their duties by letting the the cottages fall into disrepair.<br/><br/>Mr H.R.Williams, the Trustee who had written to the paper earlier, said that he had it on the best authority that the Church Commissioners would make no roads whatever and they would not be benefitted one iota by the actions of the Charity Commissioners. Others were far less trusting and the meeting closed after nearly three hours.<br/><br/>'We are faced with the fact that in Highgate and Muswell Hill there are a number of persons who want the Churchyard Bottom Wood and will not be happy until they have got it - while nobody appears willing to spend a farthing to pay for it. Everyone says it would be a fine thing to have the wood as open space, but everybody thinks it is the duty of someone else to make it one. The Islington Vestry has 'resolved' on the subject, but the Islington Vestry does not offer a penny piece towards the purchase. --- There is no more difficult problem for the community or the individual to solve than how to gain possession of other people's property without paying for it.'<br/><br/>Paying for it was indeed the problem as Churchyard Bottom Wood became the subject of intense local and national debate. A joint committee was formed to raise money to save the wood. On 20 November 1896, C.F.Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, wrote to The Standard, a daily paper at that time, appealing for help. He reminded everyone of the danger of losing the wood and said it could only be saved by buying it. The Church Commissioners would sell for £25,000 and an extra (5,000 would be required for fencing and drainage, making a total of £30,000. This was too much for Hornsey Council to raise but they had already voted £10,000 towards the total. The woods were of inestimable value to all of North London so he appealed to public bodies and private people to raise the remaining £20,000. He warned that the present offer from the Church Commissioners was open only to the end of 1898. After that the builders would move in.<br/><br/>The appeal was warmly welcomed by the press. A Private Bill was rushed through Parliament and the Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, became law. The Conunittee now had the right to advertise for contributions towards buying the Wood and preserving it.<br/><br/>In a fairly short time almost all the money was raised, but the last few thousand proved very difficult to raise and the Commissioners' deadline was a matter of weeks away. Mr Cory-Wright wrote pleading for more time but was granted a mere three months and then only if interest at 4 per cent was paid for the extra period on the full sum. In the end the London County Council, which had originally offered £2,500, made this up to £5,000 and the total was reached, but it was a close-run thing.<br/><br/>The Council decided to re-name the Wood as 'Queen's Woods' in honour of Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee and Hornsey put on a fine display of bunting when the Duchess of Albany formally declared the Wood open 'for the free use of the public for ever'.<br/><br/>While the campaign to save Churchyard Bottom Wood was run and directed by local people who felt passionately about this particular piece of woodland, they called on the help and experience of a vast network of people, some of whom had worked together on similar campaigns for over thirty years. The Committee issued an appeal, printed on very good quality paper and bearing some famous names.<br/><br/>The questions of open space and public health were major subjects of the Victorian vision.<br/><br/>The Open Spaces Movement<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, the great housing reformer, who had begun with three old houses in Marylebone, bought for her by Jolm Ruskin, had quickly become an expert on housing poor people in the healthiest conditions possible. Her way was to buy leases and then knock down some of the crowded houses in order to bring light and air to the rest, believing that fresh air and sunlight were the the only way poor people could be saved from 'putrid fever. She had learnt this as a child from her grandfather, Southwood Smith, who developed his theories at the Fever Hospital at King's Cross.<br/><br/>He had built the first Industrial Dwellings for poor people and had proved statistically that good air and decent drainage saved lives. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is a direct outcome of Southwood Smith's ideas. More Information on Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>The Importance of Open Air<br/><br/>Open spaces and the opportunity to breathe clean air, were essential for people living in one or two crowded rooms. Octavia Hill took her charges from the Lisson Grove slums, up Fitzjohn's Avenue to Hampstead Heath. She so loved the Fitzjohn's Avenue fields that she tried to buy them as a public park. They were to cost £10,000 and within three August weeks £8,500 had been raised. It needed only the end of the summer holidays and the return from holiday of sympathetic friends and the further £1,500 would have been raised, but the owners suddenly withdrew their offer. Despite all pleading, the fields were covered with large houses.<br/><br/>From this developed the campaign to save Parliament Hill, the next open space northwards from Lisson Grove, buying up fields in the path of the builders to make a permanent cordon sanitalre against the advancing bricks. The Parliament Hill Fields campaign was so successful that the Hampstead Heath Bill was passed and there was money over from the appeal. From this money and the impetus towards open spaces, was to develop the National Trust. Octavia Hill had been interested in protecting areas like Church Bottom Wood for years, so she was a natural ally in the fight to save the Wood.<br/><br/>The Commons Preservation Society also, was familiar with this kind of agitation and money collection. They had torn down fencing when lords of the manor had enclosed pieces of common land, leading both legal and illegal battles against the arrogant privatization of land traditionally free. Robert Hunter, their Honorary Solicitor from 1868, was always concerned with securing open spaces, large or small, for the public. He, now Sir Robert Hunter, became the Chairman of the Church Bottom Appeal. The Chairman of the Commons Preservation Society was Mr Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) who played a big part in this and other campaigns in the House of Commons. Octavia Hill had been involved in their work from about 1875.<br/><br/>At the same time Octavia Hill was campaigning for a Burials Bill.<br/><br/>City churchyards had become so full and such a serious a hazard to health, by contaminating wells from which people drew their drinking water, that City burials were no longer permitted. Instead, cemetries were created on the outskirts of town. Abney Park Cemetary was one of these. There was then a movement to remove the headstones to the edges of the old town cemetries, re-inter the bodies elsewhere and turn the cemetries into gardens and open spaces, instead of building on them. This land in the centre of London was very valuable and speculators were avid to obtain it: Even the Quakers had built over one of their cemetries and threatened to do so again by building over Bunhill Fields. Octavia Hill had a network of allies in a dozen fields, so her help to save the Church Bottom Wood must have been invaluable.<br/><br/>The Metropolitan Gardens Society, set up in 1882, had laid out about two hundred small gardens in city centres by 1890. They later handed them over to the Local Authorities, so their support for the Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal was assured from the start.<br/><br/>The Kyrle Society is forgotten now, but in its day had great influence on Town Planning and Open Space legislation. The Society had been set up about 1875 for 'the Diffusion of Beauty', to bring colour and interest into the lives of people living in dull, drab surroundings. Bright colour to walls and decoration, good singing, open spaces, Nature, Literature and Art. All these fell within the Society's remit. There was a Decorative Branch, for whom William Morris lectured; a Musical Branch to promote choirs and Happy Evenings for people in local school buildings; and a Literature Branch. The Society appealed regularly by letters in The Times, to 'the richer classes' for books and periodicals to be distributed to boys' and girls' clubs, almshouses and elsewhere. However the Open Spaces Committee was the most active. The very name 'Kyrle' came from Pope's The Man of Ross, the philanthropist who gave his birthplace to the people as a public park. | Kerkhof Bodem Hout<br/><br/>Highgate<br/><br/>Kerkhof Bodem Hout, Highgate<br/><br/>Het heet nu Queen's Wood.<br/><br/>Tussen 1860 en 1880 werd het centrum uit de stad Londen gescheurd om riolen, spoorwegen en nieuwe wegen te bouwen. Huizen werden gesloopt zonder rekening te houden met de huurders die elders accommodatie moesten vinden. Managers gingen naar live in Kensington en St. John's Wood, terwijl de armste druk in de rookeries zoals Seven Dials en Lisson Grove. Voor degenen tussen hen, de bedienaren en bekwame arbeiders, speculatieve bouwers zetten rij na rij van terrasvormige villa's en Mr Pooter verhuisde naar Holloway. De mensen van Muswell Hill zagen huizen kruipen over de velden van Finsbury Park, Crouch Hill en de andere kant, zodat in 1880 Crouch End werd ontwikkeld en er leek geen manier om de stroom te stoppen. Tien jaar later werden de grote landgoederen van Muswell Hill verkocht. Upton Farm werd verkocht en de kerkelijke commissarissen wilden Churchyard Bottom Wood, nu Queen's Wood genoemd, ontwikkelen. Het verhaal zou een Ibsen-spel hebben gemaakt. Twee groepen eerlijke, zeer gemotiveerde mensen vechten voor wat ze allemaal dachten dat juist was. De kerkelijke commissarissen aan de ene kant en het comité van de Hornsey Charities aan de andere kant geloofden beiden dat ze hun best deden voor andere mensen, en het publiek rees tegen hen beiden in verontwaardiging.<br/><br/>In die tijd was Muswell Hill Road een landweg, met Southwood Hall aan de ene kant en Upton Farm aan de andere kant. In 1894 werd Onslow Gardens gebouwd, Connaught Gardens gemarkeerd en bouwers stonden klaar om het landgoed Woodlands te ontwikkelen. Uitgesneden van Churchyard Bottom Wood was een groep van tuimelhuisjes, op een driehoekige site. Een niet-gedateerde kaart, gehouden door de kerkelijke commissarissen, toont zes Wasteland Cottages met een opening tussen hen - geen weg, niet gemetalliseerd, maar een weg door naar de aardbeienbedden achter. Verderop was er nog een kloof die leidde tot voetpaden door het bos. Deze twee openingen moesten de basis van het plan zijn. Dezelfde twee kloven en de opgeruimde grond, die het aardbeiveld was, zijn te zien in de kaart van 1894 hieronder. Ze worden getoond als 'Muswell Hill Cottages' en, trouwens, Peter Sellers zou veel later op dezelfde site wonen. Om het hout als woning te ontwikkelen, moesten de commissarissen twee wegen doorrijden vanaf Muswell Hill Road en er huizen langs bouwen. De voorkant van de Muswell Hill Road alleen zou niet genoeg ruimte hebben geboden voor huizen om de onderneming de moeite waard te maken.<br/><br/>Het land en de huisjes waren veel eerder gegeven als aalmoezenhuizen om bejaarden te huisvesten en werden namens hen gehouden door de trustees van de liefdadigheidscommissarissen van Hornsey. Tegen de jaren 1890 waren de huisjes ingestort, en hadden ze grote reparaties nodig. Publiek-geïnspireerd, willen het beste doen voor hun oude huurders, konden de trustees ze niet verbeteren omdat ze geen geld hadden. Enkele jaren voordat de kerkelijke commissarissen van plan waren om Gravel Pit Wood (nu Highgate Wood) te ontwikkelen als woninglandgoed, was dit echter zo verzet dat ze zich terugtrokken. In plaats daarvan gaven ze in 1886 alle 69 hectare bos aan het publiek. Tegelijkertijd boden ze aan om Churchyard Bottom Wood te verkopen aan Hornsey Urban District Council voor £ 25.000, maar dit was te veel voor Hornsey om op zichzelf te verhogen. De Raad zei dat mensen die buiten Hornsey wonen ook genoten van het hout en andere autoriteiten zouden moeten helpen, maar er werd geen hulp gegeven.<br/><br/>Kaart met de Muswell Hill Cottages die het centrum van de controverse waren.<br/><br/>Muswell Hill Road ongeveer 1880<br/><br/>Het lijkt waarschijnlijk dat deze drie paar huisjes het middelpunt van het geschil waren.<br/><br/>De kerkelijke commissarissen wilden geld inzamelen voor hun kerkelijk werk in Groot-Brittannië en in het buitenland. Zij waren van mening dat zij het land hadden gekregen om te worden gebruikt voor het propogaat van de religie en als dit betekende dat land of bossen werden verkocht, was het een minder kwaad dan het beperken van het werk van de kerk. Ze hadden Gravel Pit Wood aan het publiek gegeven: in plaats daarvan zouden ze Churchyard Bottom Wood ontwikkelen.<br/><br/>De trustees van de Hornsey Charities wilden een inkomen genereren om hun arme mensen te helpen, dus deden ze een aanbod aan de commissarissen. Hun driehoekige stuk land was te onhandig gevormd om economisch te worden ontwikkeld, maar als de commissarissen hen wat meer land zouden geven om het tot een vierkante site te maken, zouden ze vijfentwintig nette villa's bouwen. Deze zouden een grondrente van £225 per jaar opleveren, die gebruikt zou kunnen worden om de armoede van de Hornsey-bevolking te verlichten, en zouden de Commissie in ruil daarvoor toestaan twee wegen door hun land te snijden, zodat de commissarissen het bos konden ontwikkelen.<br/><br/>Toen dit aanbod bekend werd, reageerden mensen onmiddellijk met alarm.<br/><br/>Op 16 december 1893 vroeg de heer Carvell Williams MP in het Lagerhuis, of de kerkelijke commissarissen had ingestemd met de verkoop van een strook van land aan de Hornsey Charities Trustees op voorwaarde dat een bestaande weg zou worden verbredd tot 40 voet, of dit was een voorloper van een bouwplan en of het Huis van Parlement zou hebben een kans om een mening te uiten.<br/><br/>De heer Leveson Gower, commissaris voor Kerkelijke Landgoederen, antwoordde "ja" op het eerste deel.<br/><br/>Mr. Carvell Williams, "Begrijp ik dat het de bedoeling is om dat deel van Highgate Woods te vernietigen door erop te bouwen?"<br/><br/>Twee dagen later publiceerde The Star een artikel dat elk modern tabloid waardig was.<br/><br/>De ster<br/>18 december 1893<br/><br/>'Het Parlement moet de oude vandalen en confederaten van de kerriebouwer, de kerkelijke commissarissen, nauwlettend in de gaten houden. Ze vervreemden altijd een stuk land of begunstigen de bouwers in plaats van het grote publiek. De commissarissen zouden het onderste hout van de kerkhof niet aan de belastingbetalers verkopen, maar nu voorstellen om 'het te openen' door er twee brede wegen doorheen te snijden in verband met een van hun talrijke bouwprogramma's. Zal er niet iemand in het Parlement een vraag stellen en het bakstenen en mortelbeleid van de commissarissen controleren?<br/><br/>Tegen de tijd dat dit werd gedrukt, was de vraag gesteld en was het antwoord onwaar of misleidend. Andere kranten namen het verhaal op. The Times, in een lang rapport, zei dat de Comnussioners waren niet bereid om een verbintenis dat het Parlement, of een andere publieke instantie, moet een kans om een plan voor de bouw op de site van het hout te overwegen.<br/><br/>De situatie werd achttien maanden lang gekookt totdat de kerkelijke commissarissen gedwongen werden een onderzoek in te stellen, dat op 31 mei 1895 in Highgate begon, onder voorzitterschap van een assistent-kerkelijke commissaris. Het onderzoek leverde een overvloed aan krantenbrieven op, waarvan dit de belangrijkste was.<br/><br/>De dagelijkse kroniek, 5 juni 1895<br/><br/>VANDALISME BIJ HIGHGATE<br/><br/>Meneer -<br/><br/>Een van de mooiste stukjes bos in het suburaan Londen wordt bedreigd. Helpt u ons een ramp af te weren, niet alleen voor het directe district, maar voor het hele dichtbevolkte Noord-Londen? In geen enkel deel van de metropool is de bouwer actiever geweest dan in Crouch End en Hornsey. De prachtige weiden van een jaar of twee geleden zijn nu huizen en winkels. Ballasthopen hebben de plaats ingenomen van statige iepen en kastanjes, en eenmaal aangename dorpen delen het lot van Stroud Green, Harringay, Finsbury Park, Highbury en Islington.<br/><br/>---- Het doel is de bouw van twee veertig meter wegen door het bos. Wij in deze wijk kennen de betekenis van veertig meter wegen door het bos. Het betekent dat het bos gedoemd is. Tien jaar geleden heeft agitatie het zusterhout van vijfenzestig hectaren gered - The Gravel Pit Woods - en niemand die de Bank Holiday menigten zag stroomden de Archway Road van de sombere straten van Holloway, Islington en Clerkenwell, en keek naar het scherpe plezier van de kinderen en familiefeesten die op het gras en onder de bomen picknicken. ----<br/><br/>--- De kerkelijke commissarissen bezitten bijna een derde van de grote parochie van Hornsey. Door de liberale uitgave van het geld van de belastingbetalers aan de openstelling van wegen en de algemene ontwikkeling van het district is de waarde van hun eigendom enorm toegenomen, en uit deze onverdiende toename halen ze elk jaar grote inkomsten. De belastingbetalers wiens geld zo heeft bijgedragen aan het creëren van de immense nalatenschap kunnen zeker een liberale behandeling in ruil verwachten.<br/><br/>Uwe gehoorzaamheid,<br/><br/>Getekend door de vicaris van St James', Muswell Hill, de minister van Park Chapel, Crouch End, een barrister die in Onslow Gardens woont en drie leden van de District Council.<br/><br/>Het was een schot recht door de bogen van de kerkelijke commissarissen, hun eigen religieuze leiders en de Districtsraad, allemaal in de armen, die in feite zeiden dat de kerk te rijk was en liefdadigheid zou moeten zijn, niet hebzuchtig. De opname van de twee geestelijken was een slimme zet. Vergeet niet dat dit nog steeds op het hoogtepunt van de Darwin-controverse was. Darwin had het geloof in de leringen van de Kerk verdeeld en veel mensen zouden de macht van de Kerk alleen al vanuit dat gezichtspunt gekwetst hebben. De Kerk was niet zo veilig als ze zich voordeed.<br/><br/>Het Avondnieuws, 7 juni 1895 zei:-<br/><br/>Als de kerkelijke medemensen niet in één keer worden aangepakt, zal de bouwoctopus een greep krijgen op het hout dat later erg moeilijk los te maken zal zijn. Daarom moeten Londenaren opstaan en doen als ze een van hun meest verrukkelijke stukjes rustiek landschap zouden redden. Het openbaar onderzoek is uitgesteld tot donderdag volgende, en voor die tijd moet er iets worden gedaan om de commissarissen ervan te overtuigen dat de burgers van Londen de confiscatie van een van hun favoriete speeltuinen niet zullen tolereren.<br/><br/>Een brief in de Daily Chronicle de volgende dag zei:-<br/><br/>.... Het was met grote opluchting dat de bewoners, zo’n tien jaar geleden, hoorden dat de aankoop van het bovenste hout was gedaan; en hoe heerlijk een zegen dit is gebleken, kan iedereen die hen bezocht, getuigen, maar allen die zich inspanden om deze bovenste bossen, die aan de westkant van Muswell Hill Road liggen, te redden, vonden dat hun overwinning onvolledig was zolang de zestig hectare aan de oostkant bleef. Het is als het ware een toeval dat de bossen worden verdeeld door een brede hoge weg. Kan iemand twijfelen wat het effect zou zijn als de kerkhof onderste hout worden vervangen door rijen van kleine villa's, die elk hun bijdrage van rook en roet uitzenden? Kan ook iemand twijfelen aan het ernstige verschil dat het zou maken aan de pittoreske omgeving van de gekochte bossen als er een rij nieuwe huizen tegen hun bladerige voorgevel zouden worden aangelopen?<br/><br/>Dit bracht de meningen van veel mensen tot uitdrukking. In feite was het Gravel Pit Wood, dat de schrijver het 'Oppere Hout' noemt, niet gekocht, maar door de Kerkelijke Commissie aan het district gegeven, een punt dat ze door de jaren heen keer op keer moesten herhalen, maar de meeste mensen negeerden het. De Commissie was niet van plan om een tweede hout weg te geven wat iemand zei, en hield dit standpunt tot het einde.<br/><br/>H.S. Chamberlain, van 5 Cranley Gardens, in een brief aan de Times van 8 juni 1895, drong aan op aankoop.<br/><br/>Ik weet dat het gebruikelijk is om hard te spreken van de kerkelijke commissarissen enz., maar als de trustees van een fonds, die ze al in het grootste voordeel moeten besturen, hebben ze een bedrijf, dat ze voor het grootste voordeel moeten kopen, en daarom, als er iets gedaan moet worden om de sloop van het hout te redden, lijkt het mij dat het alleen kan worden gedaan door de aankoop van het eigendom van de Comnussioners, die ik ken, dat vrij zou zijn, dat de mensen in de vrije geest zouden hebben, en vrij zouden voelen, die zich van de bescherming van de zaak zouden delen.<br/><br/>(Dit verwijst naar de Crouch End Playing Fields die een paar jaar later waren beveiligd.)<br/><br/>Als voorzitter van de Muswell Hill Conservative Association, ben ik voortdurend in contact met de inwoners, en ik kan veilig bevestigen dat elke persoon die in de buurt woont alles zou doen om het te behouden.<br/><br/>(Alles wat hij persoonlijk wilde was een inkomen van liefdadigheid om zijn arme volk te ondersteunen. Hij eiste zijn acre grond - niet veel zeker - hij geloofde de verzekering van de commissarissen dat het hout niet in gevaar was.)<br/><br/>'Muswell Hill Road was een van de beste in Hornsey en zou net zo mooi blijven, huizen of geen huizen',<br/><br/>(En toen kwam de grote retorische bloei.)<br/><br/>'Zijn de armen te lijden vanwege de sentimentele bezwaren en de hysterische kreet van 'wolf net opgevoed door uw correspondenten? Een acre van achterland toegevoegd aan het liefdadigheidslandschap zou geen waardevol verschil maken voor het land dat overblijft, terwijl de winst die daaruit voortvloeit veel arme oude en waardige personen in hun dalende jaren zou helpen en ons in staat zou stellen om aan onze opvolgers een landgoed te overhandigen dat in de verre toekomst van grote waarde zou zijn in het verlenen van liefdadigheidshulp aan de waardige armen van de parochie van Horn.<br/><br/>Als men zijn brief leest, voelt men hysterie heel dicht bij de oppervlakte. Waarom dacht hij dat de commissarissen een weg wilden bouwen? Waarom zouden ze al dat geld uitgeven als ze geen huizen wilden bouwen? Hij leek zich nooit te realiseren dat voor een hectare land het hele hout verloren zou gaan, maar hij had al lang met het probleem te maken. Hij was de persoon aan wie de Commissarissen een bod hadden gedaan voor £ 25.000 voordien en het is zijn naam die wordt geëerd op een plaquette op de Crouch End Clock Tower voor het redden van het hout, maar zijn vertrouwen in de kerkelijke Commissarissen lijkt naïef. Het is jammer dat hij bij het onderzoek als de duivel moest worden geworpen.<br/><br/>Het onderzoek werd voortgezet<br/><br/>Op 15 juni 1895 werd in Highgate het verdaagde gebouw geopend. In afwachting van een grote bijeenkomst was de Raadskamer volledig gewijzigd. De gebruikelijke tafels waren verwijderd en de zaal was gevuld met stoelen. Tegen half zeven was de kamer overvol, met mensen die om stoelen jaagden.<br/><br/>De heer Murray, de commissaris, zei dat het onderzoek echt eenvoudig was: Hornsey Parochial Charities wenste een stuk land aan de achterzijde van hun liefdadigheidswoning te kopen. De vraag was of de liefdadigheidscommissie, die alle goede doelen beheerste, voldoende macht had om ze te stoppen. De kerkcommissarissen waren bereid het land tegen zeer gunstige voorwaarden te verkopen en het inkomen van de Liefdadigheid zou zeer aanzienlijk worden verhoogd.<br/><br/>Daartegen waren er drie soorten bezwaar.<br/><br/>De oorspronkelijke Trust was bedoeld om huisjes te voorzien voor de armen, maar de trustees stelden voor om villa's te bouwen die te duur zouden zijn voor de armen. Het was echter binnen de macht van de trustees om de voorwaarden van de trust te wijzigen, zodat ze villa's konden bouwen als ze dachten dat de armen uiteindelijk zouden profiteren. De arme mensen zelf zouden daar bezwaar tegen kunnen maken, maar er waren al liberale bepalingen voor hen beloofd. Het derde bezwaar had betrekking op de esthetische en publieke kant van de vraag. Hij haalde uit wat hij had gelezen dat de liefdadigheidscommissie zich moest bemoeien om te voorkomen dat de kerkelijke commissarissen hun eigen discretie uitoefenden in de omgang met hun eigen eigendommen.<br/><br/>Het onderzoek besprak fijne punten, maar de sprekers bleven terugkomen op het grote probleem van het voorkomen van enige vernietiging van het hout. De Vestry Clerk van Islington, die 300.000 mensen vertegenwoordigde, maakte een formeel protest tegen elk deel van het hout, zo waardevol voor de mensen van Islington en Hornsey die voor privédoeleinden werden gebruikt. De heer Wilfred White zei dat als de commissarissen hen de tijd zouden geven, zij in staat zouden zijn het geld in te zamelen om de curatoren te compenseren.<br/><br/>Beaumont zei dat ze geen villa's wilden, ze wilden huisjes voor arme mensen die uit het district werden verdreven. Anderen zeiden dat er geen geld was om huisjes te bouwen om de huidige vervallen te vervangen, maar villa's zouden een economische propositie zijn. Anderen beweerden dat er tal van villa's waren om in Highgate te huren. Het hout was heilig. Blijf bij de vraag van het hout.<br/><br/>Dr. Fletcher zei dat de schreeuw onder de werkenden was dat er nergens heen kon. Werkende mensen kwamen naar hem toe met de schreeuw: "We worden uit Highgate verdreven en zijn verplicht om naar Highgate New Town te gaan." Als de voorkant van de Muswell Hill Road werd verkocht, was er geen twijfel, maar dat wegen door het bos in de richting van Hornsey zouden kunnen worden afgesneden, maar als de commissarissen het land niet konden krijgen van de liefdadigheidscommissie, konden ze de weg niet afsnijden.<br/><br/>Hij was er erg zeker van dat de huisjes in een geschikte staat van reparatie kunnen worden geplaatst. Hij werd gevraagd door de armen, door de politie en door een aantal arbeidersklassen om deze twee punten te vertegenwoordigen, dat huisvesting zeer hard nodig was in Highgate en dat als ze ooit toestonden dat het land verkocht zou worden, er geen sprake was van waar de hand van de bouwer zou blijven.<br/><br/>(Loud en langdurig gejuich).<br/><br/>Talrijke andere mensen spraken en de Comnussioner vatte het samen door te zeggen dat hij het nam dat de heersende mening voorstander was van het behoud van de huisjes, maar de vergadering mag geen conclusies trekken uit wat hij had gezegd (Groans).<br/><br/>Anderen zeiden dat de trustees van de liefdadigheid hadden gefaald in hun taken door het laten van de huisjes in verval raken.<br/><br/>De heer H.R. Williams, de trustee die eerder naar de krant had geschreven, zei dat hij het op het beste gezag had dat de kerkcommissarissen geen wegen zouden maken en dat ze niet één jota zouden profiteren van de acties van de liefdadigheidscommissarissen. Anderen waren veel minder vertrouwend en de vergadering sloot na bijna drie uur.<br/><br/>"We worden geconfronteerd met het feit dat er in Highgate en Muswell Hill een aantal mensen zijn die de Churchyard Bottom Wood willen en niet gelukkig zullen zijn totdat ze het hebben - terwijl niemand bereid lijkt een fortuin uit te geven om het te betalen. Iedereen zegt dat het fijn zou zijn om het hout als open ruimte te hebben, maar iedereen denkt dat het de plicht van iemand anders is om het een te maken. De Islington Vestry heeft hierover 'opgelost', maar de Islington Vestry biedt geen cent voor de aankoop. Er is geen moeilijker probleem voor de gemeenschap of het individu om op te lossen dan hoe je eigendommen van anderen in bezit kunt nemen zonder ervoor te betalen.<br/><br/>Het betalen voor het was inderdaad het probleem omdat Churchyard Bottom Wood het onderwerp werd van intensief lokaal en nationaal debat. Er werd een gezamenlijke commissie opgericht om geld in te zamelen om het hout te redden. Op 20 november 1896, C.F. Cory-Wright, Hon Treasurer, schreef aan The Standard, een dagblad dat destijds om hulp vroeg. Hij herinnerde iedereen aan het gevaar om het hout te verliezen en zei dat het alleen gered kon worden door het te kopen. De kerkcommissarissen zouden verkopen voor £ 25.000 en een extra (5.000 zou nodig zijn voor hekwerk en drainage, een totaal van £ 30.000. Dit was te veel voor Hornsey Council te verhogen, maar ze hadden al gestemd £ 10.000 voor het totaal. De bossen waren van onschatbare waarde voor heel Noord-Londen, dus hij een beroep op openbare instanties en particulieren om de resterende £ 20.000 te verhogen. Hij waarschuwde dat het huidige aanbod van de kerkcommissarissen was alleen open voor het einde van 1898. Daarna verhuisden de bouwers naar binnen.<br/><br/>Het beroep werd hartelijk verwelkomd door de pers. Een Private Bill werd gehaast door het Parlement en de Highgate Woods Preservation Act, 1897, werd wet. De Conunittee had nu het recht om te adverteren voor bijdragen aan de aankoop van het hout en het behoud ervan.<br/><br/>In een vrij korte tijd werd bijna al het geld ingezameld, maar de laatste paar duizend bleek zeer moeilijk te verhogen en de deadline van de commissarissen was een kwestie van weken. De heer Cory-Wright schreef dat hij meer tijd nodig had, maar dat hij slechts drie maanden kreeg en dan pas als er rente van 4 procent werd betaald voor de extra periode op het volledige bedrag. Uiteindelijk maakte de London County Council, die oorspronkelijk £ 2.500 had aangeboden, dit tot £ 5.000 en het totaal werd bereikt, maar het was een close-run ding.<br/><br/>De Raad besloot om het hout te hernoemen tot 'Queen's Woods' ter ere van het diamanten jubileum van koningin Victoria en Hornsey stelde een mooie vertoning van bunting toen de hertogin van Albany formeel verklaarde het hout open 'voor het gratis gebruik van het publiek voor altijd'.<br/><br/>Terwijl de campagne om Churchyard Bottom Wood te redden werd gerund en geleid door lokale mensen die gepassioneerd waren over dit specifieke stuk bos, riepen ze op tot de hulp en ervaring van een groot netwerk van mensen, van wie sommigen al meer dan dertig jaar samen aan soortgelijke campagnes hadden gewerkt. Het Comité heeft een beroep ingesteld, gedrukt op papier van zeer goede kwaliteit en met enkele bekende namen.<br/><br/>De kwesties van de open ruimte en de volksgezondheid waren belangrijke onderwerpen van de Victoriaanse visie.<br/><br/>De Open Spaces Beweging<br/><br/>Octavia Hill, de grote woninghervormer, die met drie oude huizen in Marylebone was begonnen, voor haar gekocht door Jolm Ruskin, was al snel een expert geworden in het huisvesten van arme mensen in de meest gezonde omstandigheden mogelijk. Haar manier was om huurovereenkomsten te kopen en vervolgens een aantal van de drukke huizen omver te werpen om licht en lucht naar de rest te brengen, in de overtuiging dat frisse lucht en zonlicht de enige manier waren waarop arme mensen konden worden gered van 'putrid koorts. Ze had dit als kind geleerd van haar grootvader, Southwood Smith, die zijn theorieën ontwikkelde in het Koortsziekenhuis bij King's Cross.<br/><br/>Hij had de eerste industriële woningen voor arme mensen gebouwd en had statistisch bewezen dat goede lucht en fatsoenlijke drainage levens hebben gered. Gibson Gardens, in Northwold Road, is een direct resultaat van de ideeën van Southwood Smith. Meer informatie over Gibson Gardens<br/><br/>Het belang van open lucht<br/><br/>Open ruimtes en de mogelijkheid om schone lucht in te ademen, waren essentieel voor mensen die in een of twee drukke kamers woonden. Octavia Hill nam haar kosten van de Lisson Grove sloppenwijken, op Fitzjohn's Avenue naar Hampstead Heath. Ze hield zo veel van de velden van Fitzjohn's Avenue dat ze probeerde ze te kopen als een openbaar park. Ze moesten £ 10.000 kosten en binnen drie augustusweken was £ 8.500 verhoogd. Het had alleen het einde van de zomervakantie en de terugkeer van de vakantie van sympathieke vrienden en de verdere £ 1.500 zou zijn verhoogd, maar de eigenaren plotseling hun aanbod ingetrokken. Ondanks alle pleidooien, waren de velden bedekt met grote huizen.<br/><br/>Hieruit ontwikkelde zich de campagne om Parliament Hill, de volgende open ruimte ten noorden van Lisson Grove, te redden, door velden in het pad van de bouwers te kopen om een permanente cordon sanitaire tegen de voortschrijdende bakstenen te maken. De campagne van Parliament Hill Fields was zo succesvol dat de Hampstead Heath Bill werd aangenomen en er was geld over van de oproep. Van dit geld en de impuls naar open ruimtes, was de ontwikkeling van de National Trust. Octavia Hill was jarenlang geïnteresseerd in het beschermen van gebieden zoals Church Bottom Wood, dus ze was een natuurlijke bondgenoot in de strijd om het hout te redden.<br/><br/>De Commons Preservation Society was ook bekend met dit soort agitatie en geldinzameling. Ze hadden het hekwerk afgebroken toen heren van het landgoed stukken gemeenschappelijk land hadden omsloten, wat zowel juridische als illegale gevechten leidde tegen de arrogante privatisering van land dat traditioneel vrij was. Robert Hunter, hun Ereadvocaat uit 1868, was altijd bezig met het veiligstellen van open ruimten, groot of klein, voor het publiek. Hij, nu Sir Robert Hunter, werd de voorzitter van de Church Bottom Appeal. De voorzitter van de Commons Preservation Society was de heer Shaw-Lefevre MP (later Lord Eversley) die een grote rol speelde in deze en andere campagnes in het Lagerhuis. Octavia Hill was betrokken geweest bij hun werk vanaf ongeveer 1875.<br/><br/>Tegelijkertijd was Octavia Hill aan het campagne voeren voor een begrafeniswet.<br/><br/>De kerkhofen van de stad waren zo vol geworden en zo ernstig een gevaar voor de gezondheid, door het vervuilen van putten waaruit mensen hun drinkwater haalden, dat begrafenissen van de stad niet meer toegestaan waren. In plaats daarvan werden begraafplaatsen aan de rand van de stad gecreëerd. Abney Park Cemetery was een van deze. Er was toen een beweging om de hoofdstenen aan de randen van de oude stad begraafplaatsen te verwijderen, opnieuw tussen de lichamen elders en de begraafplaatsen te veranderen in tuinen en open ruimtes, in plaats van op hen te bouwen. Dit land in het centrum van Londen was zeer waardevol en speculanten waren enthousiast om het te verkrijgen: zelfs de Quakers hadden boven een van hun begraafplaatsen gebouwd en dreigden dit opnieuw te doen door boven Bunhill Fields te bouwen. Octavia Hill had een netwerk van bondgenoten in een dozijn velden, dus haar hulp om de kerk Bodem Wood te redden moet van onschatbare waarde zijn geweest.<br/><br/>De Metropolitan Gardens Society, opgericht in 1882, had ongeveer tweehonderd kleine tuinen in stadscentra aangelegd tegen 1890. Ze overhandigden ze later aan de lokale autoriteiten, dus hun steun voor de Churchyard Bottom Wood Appeal werd vanaf het begin verzekerd.<br/><br/>De Kyrle Society is nu vergeten, maar had destijds grote invloed op de wetgeving inzake stadsplanning en open ruimte. Het Genootschap was rond 1875 opgericht voor 'de verspreiding van schoonheid', om kleur en interesse te brengen in het leven van mensen die in een saaie, saaie omgeving leven. Heldere kleur aan muren en decoratie, goed zingen, open ruimtes, natuur, literatuur en kunst. Er was een decoratieve tak, voor wie William Morris les gaf; een muzikale tak om koren te promoten en gelukkige avonden voor mensen in lokale schoolgebouwen; en een literaire tak. Het Genootschap pleitte regelmatig per brief in The Times voor 'de rijkere klassen' om boeken en tijdschriften te verspreiden naar jongens- en meisjesclubs, aalmoezenhuizen en elders. De naam 'Kyrle' kwam van Pope's The Man of Ross, de filantrope die zijn geboorteplaats aan het volk gaf als een openbaar park. |
| With Thanksgiving around the corner, here are some festive file folder games we made for the girls. Both Thanksgiving games focus on math skills. And I'm grateful once again to my husband, Ed, for making all the clipart for me.<br/><br/>Thanksgiving Pattern Making<br/><br/>Like the name says, this game is about making patterns. Little ones just learning about patterns, can simply match the pictures onto the pattern strips, while others can continue the pattern with the picture cards on the blank strips.<br/><br/>To make the file folder, you want to cut out the grid of pictures to make the card pieces. I recommend laminating them to help them last longer. Then glue the pattern strips down on the file folder.<br/><br/>I wanted to have the blank pattern strips too so that the girls could see where to continue the pattern and how many to lay out. I attached them to the side of the folder using tape so that they could fold in to pack up the game and extend to layout the pattern.<br/><br/>I also added an extra blank one so that the girls could make their own pattern as well.<br/><br/>Turkey Number Game<br/><br/>In this game the girls add the feathers to the turkey body while practicing counting and number recognition. I used the colorless feathers to act as a guide for where to add the feathers and so that the girls could match the numbers. And be sure when gluing down the turkey body you only glue in the center so that the wing pieces can slide under the body.<br/><br/>Once all the feathers are laid out, we practice some simple arithmetic, such as taking away three feathers and seeing how many are left then adding two back to see what it equals.<br/><br/>In addition to black and white wings, we also included a colorless turkey in case you want to have the little ones color their own set. Instead of a file folder game you can turn this into a craft, coloring the pieces, cutting them out, and gluing them together.<br/><br/>Another option is to use the pieces to make a felt board story. We sometimes sing a turkey version of 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Like this:<br/><br/>Who Am I?<br/><br/>I think this is where I'm suppose to say something witty about myself. Oh well. I'm a stay-at-home mom to three awesome kids--our twin daughters who are seven now and a two-year-old son who is full of energy. In my pre-children life I was a teacher and I now homeschool our children. I'm also married to Ed, who is currently serving in the Air Force, and is the love of my life (it'd be awkward if he wasn't). Our family is big on books, crafts, and having fun together. I just thought I would share our activities in my own little corner of the internet.<br/><br/>Zoe appears to have it all--rich, handsome husband, easy New York life--but she made mistakes in her past and those mistakes are coming back up in her new life. I found myself on the edge of my seat for most of the book and was surprised...<br/><br/>I loved this book, I love the story, and I am grateful Margot Shetterly brought it to light. My only complaint was that I wished she discussed Katherine Johnson's role in the later missions a bit more but I guess the story had to end som...<br/><br/>I wanted to like this book and I did throughout most of it.

I really enjoyed seei... | Met Thanksgiving om de hoek, hier zijn een aantal feestelijke folder games die we voor de meisjes hebben gemaakt. Beide Thanksgiving games richten zich op wiskundige vaardigheden. En ik ben nogmaals dankbaar voor mijn man, Ed, voor het maken van al de clipart voor mij.<br/><br/>Het maken van Thanksgiving Patroon<br/><br/>Zoals de naam al zegt, gaat dit spel over het maken van patronen. Kleintjes die gewoon leren over patronen, kunnen gewoon de foto's op de patroonstrips matchen, terwijl anderen het patroon kunnen voortzetten met de fotokaarten op de lege strips.<br/><br/>Om de bestandsmap te maken, wilt u het raster van foto's uitsnijden om de kaartstukken te maken. Ik raad aan ze te lamineren om ze langer mee te laten gaan. Plak vervolgens de patroonstrips naar beneden op de bestandsmap.<br/><br/>Ik wilde ook de blanco patroonstrips hebben zodat de meisjes konden zien waar ze het patroon konden voortzetten en hoeveel ze moesten uitleggen. Ik bevestigde ze aan de zijkant van de map met behulp van tape, zodat ze konden vouwen in om het spel in te pakken en uit te breiden naar de lay-out van het patroon.<br/><br/>Ik heb er ook een extra blanco aan toegevoegd zodat de meisjes ook hun eigen patroon konden maken.<br/><br/>Turkije nummer spel<br/><br/>In dit spel voegen de meisjes de veren toe aan het kalkoenlichaam tijdens het oefenen van tellen en nummerherkenning. Ik gebruikte de kleurloze veren om te fungeren als een gids voor waar de veren toe te voegen en zodat de meisjes de nummers konden matchen. En zorg ervoor dat je bij het lijmen van het kalkoenlichaam alleen in het midden lijmt, zodat de vleugelstukken onder het lichaam kunnen glijden.<br/><br/>Zodra alle veren zijn uitgelegd, oefenen we een eenvoudige rekenkunde, zoals het wegnemen van drie veren en zien hoeveel er over zijn en vervolgens twee terug toevoegen om te zien wat het gelijk is.<br/><br/>Naast de zwart-witte vleugels hebben we ook een kleurloze kalkoen meegenomen voor het geval je de kleintjes hun eigen set wilt laten kleuren. In plaats van een bestandsmapspel kun je dit omzetten in een ambacht, de stukken inkleuren, ze uitsnijden en ze aan elkaar plakken.<br/><br/>Een andere optie is om de stukken te gebruiken om een viltbordverhaal te maken. We zingen soms een kalkoenversie van 10 Little Indians:<br/><br/>Zoals dit:<br/><br/>Wie ben ik?<br/><br/>Ik denk dat ik hier iets geestigs over mezelf moet zeggen. Ik ben een moeder die thuisblijft met drie geweldige kinderen - onze tweelingdochters die nu zeven zijn en een tweejarige zoon die vol energie is. In mijn pre-kinderleven was ik leraar en ik nu thuisschool onze kinderen. Ik ben ook getrouwd met Ed, die momenteel dienst doet in de luchtmacht, en is de liefde van mijn leven (het zou ongemakkelijk zijn als hij dat niet was). Onze familie is groot op boeken, ambachten, en plezier hebben samen. Ik dacht gewoon dat ik onze activiteiten zou delen in mijn eigen kleine hoek van het internet.<br/><br/>Zoe lijkt het allemaal te hebben--rijke, knappe man, gemakkelijke New York leven--maar ze maakte fouten in haar verleden en die fouten komen terug in haar nieuwe leven. Ik vond mezelf op de rand van mijn stoel voor het grootste deel van het boek en was verbaasd...<br/><br/>Ik hield van dit boek, ik hou van het verhaal, en ik ben dankbaar Margot Shetterly bracht het aan het licht. Mijn enige klacht was dat ik wilde dat ze besprak Katherine Johnson's rol in de latere missies een beetje meer, maar ik denk dat het verhaal moest eindigen som...<br/><br/>Ik wilde dit boek leuk vinden en ik deed het in het grootste deel ervan.

| Alcohol use by persons under age 21 has been identified as a major public health problem. Studies note that it increases the risks for disability, and may be detrimental to the developing brain. Minors who drink are more likely to commit suicide, break the law, or be victims of violence. Alcohol is implicated in nearly one-third of youth traffic fatalities. The total annual cost of underage drinking is estimated at $62 billion. While most laws intended to prevent underage drinking are passed at the state level, there has been legislative activity and interest at the federal level to support states' efforts to curb the problem. This report describes the extent of underage alcohol use, recent legislative activity on this issue, and various policy implications. It will be updated as new data become available. | Alcoholgebruik door personen jonger dan 21 jaar is geïdentificeerd als een groot probleem voor de volksgezondheid. Studies merken op dat het de risico's voor een handicap verhoogt, en kan schadelijk zijn voor de ontwikkelende hersenen. Minderjarigen die drinken, hebben meer kans om zelfmoord te plegen, de wet te overtreden of slachtoffer te worden van geweld. Alcohol is betrokken bij bijna een derde van de verkeersdoden van jongeren. De totale jaarlijkse kosten van minderjarige drinken worden geschat op $ 62 miljard. Hoewel de meeste wetten die bedoeld zijn om te voorkomen dat minderjarigen drinken worden aangenomen op het niveau van de staat, zijn er wetgevende activiteiten en interesse op federaal niveau om de inspanningen van staten om het probleem te beperken te ondersteunen. Dit verslag beschrijft de omvang van het alcoholgebruik bij minderjarigen, recente wetgevingsactiviteiten op dit gebied en verschillende beleidsimpacten. Het zal worden bijgewerkt wanneer nieuwe gegevens beschikbaar komen. |
| Tag Archives: real food<br/><br/>Last week I wrote about the Nordic Food Manifesto, and how Denmark created a strong "real food" culture largely from an intentional effort led by Claus Meyer. It wasn't political lobbying or public petitioning that resulted in food reform, but rather a grassroots effort led by citizens with the power to actually implement and follow-through with change.<br/><br/>I ended the post alluding to one question: Why is it so hard for us to do this ourselves, as individuals? If an entire country can implement and spread a common view towards food, why can't we?<br/><br/>There's nothing really stopping us from mimicking Denmark's success. The problem is, we're inundated with so many messages about what we should be eating, and how we should be living, it's hard to know where to start. So rather than following successful frameworks that have been shown to work (like the Nordic Food Manifesto), most people jump from diet craze to diet craze, trying to find the "right way to eat."<br/><br/>But how did Claus Meyer succeed? What was the secret sauce that helped the Manifesto take hold? And is it reasonable to think we can apply those lessons to our own lives? Continue reading →<br/><br/>Share this:<br/><br/>My knife plunged into the beef with an audible crunch, pop, and sizzle.<br/><br/>"Whooaaah!"<br/><br/>I looked up at my sister as we both laughed in surprise, and continued smiling as I finished cutting my first bite.

Het was geen politieke lobby of publieke petitie die resulteerde in voedselhervorming, maar eerder een grassroots-inspanning onder leiding van burgers met de macht om daadwerkelijk te implementeren en te volgen met verandering.<br/><br/>Ik eindigde de post door te verwijzen naar een vraag: waarom is het zo moeilijk voor ons om dit zelf te doen, als individuen? Als een heel land een gemeenschappelijke visie op voedsel kan implementeren en verspreiden, waarom kunnen we dat niet?<br/><br/>Er is niets dat ons echt tegenhoudt om het succes van Denemarken na te bootsen. Het probleem is, we zijn overspoeld met zoveel berichten over wat we moeten eten, en hoe we moeten leven, het is moeilijk om te weten waar te beginnen. Dus in plaats van het volgen van succesvolle frameworks die zijn aangetoond te werken (zoals het Nordic Food Manifesto), springen de meeste mensen van dieetcraze naar dieetcraze, proberend de "juiste manier om te eten" te vinden.<br/><br/>Maar hoe is Claus Meyer erin geslaagd? Wat was de geheime saus die het Manifest hielp grijpen? En is het redelijk om te denken dat we die lessen op ons eigen leven kunnen toepassen?
