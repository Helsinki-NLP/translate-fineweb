| While acknowledging that it's impossible to argue someone into loving something they hate, and vice versa, it's still often enjoyable to attempt the argument. When we talk to people whose opinions directly contradict ours, we're forced to defend our tastes, define our opinions, and analyze why we react the way we do. Which is why we have Why Don't You Like This?, in which two of our staffers will attempt to discover whether people with opposing opinions can get beyond "No, you're wrong!" and have a civil, constructive, and possibly even convincing discussion about their points of contention. Because no matter what talk radio says, there's still a middle ground between "We agree utterly" and "I'm right, and you're stupid and evil."<br/><br/>Scott: Since discussing my Scott Pilgrim Vs. The World apostasy, we've been looking for a case where I can call you out for not liking something wonderful, and we didn't have to look for long. We were sitting right next to each other during Martin Scorsese's Hugo—me, utterly enchanted by its fantastical tribute to the wonders of early silent cinema, and you, apparently resisting it at every turn. Critical consensus has been on my side: It hit the No. 9 spot on our collective Top 15 (though you listed it as your Overrated choice), has won (or placed) in various film-critic awards, and currently enjoys an 83 score on Metacritic. That doesn't mean you're wrong, of course, but the onus is on you to explain why Hugo was, in your words, "hollow and artificial," where many of us saw it as a lovely evocation of Scorsese's childhood and the medium when it was still in its infancy. And please be gentle as you rip this butterfly apart by the wings.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: I can't be gentle, Scott. Sometimes it hurts less if you rip the Band-Aid off all at once. (And even if it doesn't, who wants to walk around wearing a half-ripped-off Band-Aid? Gross.) The fact is, I found Hugo to be a wearyingly manipulative exercise in fakery, starting from its opening glide through a Paris train station, which reminded me more than anything of Robert Zemeckis' The Polar Express. Unlike Mike D'Angelo, I'm a fan of long, unbroken takes as a way of establishing a space and encouraging viewers to unconsciously hold their breaths as a camera explores an area; but when the space being explored is a slick, shiny CGI creation, and the camera floats weightlessly through it with no physical sense that either the camera or the surroundings are really there, that exploration starts to feel like watching someone else play a videogame. And the rest of the film felt similarly poreless and unreal to me, both in terms of its setting and in terms of its highly contrived, maudlin story.<br/><br/>I don't necessarily have a problem with manufactured, stylized environments in film. I loved Baz Luhrmann's equally sprawling, utterly artificial take on Paris in Moulin Rouge, for instance, but that film has a sense of its own ridiculousness, a sense of humor about how deliberately over-the-top it is. Ditto the stylization of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, particularly in Amélie. (Both Jeunet and Luhrmann felt like strong visual influences here.) I got the sense, however, that Martin Scorsese wanted me to take Hugo entirely seriously. Even though it's yet another achingly sentimental story about a plucky orphan bringing color back into the life of a grumpy old curmudgeon. And I just couldn't.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>There is nothing I enjoy more in film than being surprised. And there's nothing I resent and resist more than being overtly manipulated, being loudly told what to feel and when to feel it. A good film does this kind of thing subtly; a bad one uses crashing music cues and sweet strings—and in this case, a grubby, huge-eyed, disheveled orphan staring woefully at the camera—to demand pathos, and to tell viewers they're horrible people if they don't serve it up on demand. That said, I can deal with sad kids and grumpy adults making life better for each other—I really dug this year's Le Havre, which was essentially the same plot without all the cutesiness—but I find the artificial environments reflect badly on the artificial emotions, and each makes the other seem more fake by turns.<br/><br/>Let's start with that. In our overlooked films video, you and Noel both took Keith to task for championing Tyrannosaur, because you felt it wasn't realistic enough—too contrived, too miserablist, too much, too far. How is it possible that you can't buy a stymied old crank who breaks things when he's angry, but you can buy an orphan living inside a giant train-station clock and embarking upon a whimsical journey to repair a mysterious automaton that he believes might bear secrets from his dead father, but which instead leads him on a quirky voyage of self-discovery, into the magical land of cinema? Did you never find Hugo's gaudy rococo design, aggressive heartstring-plucking, or wheelbarrow-loads of quirk even a little excessive or hard to swallow?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet and Luhrmann as influences on Scorsese?! Forget being indelicate, now you're deliberately poking me with a sharp stick. If you're looking for inspirations for Hugo—indeed, if you're looking for the emotional core of Hugo—you have to go back to Scorsese's childhood on Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, where an asthmatic little boy, unable to play outside with the other kids, retreated to Alexander Korda fantasies like The Thief Of Bagdad. Or, more simply, just go straight to the source himself: George Méliès, whose A Trip To The Moon remains the Big Bang of all cinematic fantasies, that moment when the camera was not used to document the world as it is, but whatever whimsical, magical, transporting place a filmmaker wants to invent for it. And that tradition has been developed and expanded upon for decades before the likes of Jeunet and Luhrmann got their grubby little paws on it.<br/><br/>And speaking of Jeunet, nice attempt to take away my rhetorical weapon, but I'll say it anyway: How can you love Amélie, yet find Hugo synthetic and "excessive" and "wearyingly manipulative"? You say that Amélie and Moulin Rouge have redeeming "sense of [their] own ridiculousness" where Scorsese means us to take Hugo seriously, and I don't think that's the case, at least on the latter point. That Scorsese feels evident passion about the movies is, I suppose, why you'd interpret Hugo as self-serious. But to me, it's those feelings that give the film an emotional ballast that the Luhrmann and Jeunet films don't have. All three films make aggressive use of the marvels of CGI—and Scorsese adds 3D to the mix, to wonderful effect—but where you and I differ is on the issue of weightlessness. I agree that CGI has a distancing effect; worlds composed entirely of digital plasticine are flexible to the point where they sometimes have no presence. You referred to Hugo in your "Overrated" entry for our Best Of Film piece as "a CGI gimcrack"—a perfect dis… for another movie.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>It's fair to say that Scorsese has built Hugo around a standard-issue, "heartstring-plucking" children's book/movie plot: Orphan misses his daddy, creates his own little fantasy world, gloms onto a new friend, convinces a crusty old fuddy-duddy to soften up and maybe adopt him. But that's just the narrative skeleton, and Scorsese provides plenty of flesh and blood. For one, you can't watch Hugo, the lonely boy, peering out from clock towers to the hustle-and-bustle of a Paris train station without thinking of Scorsese, another lonely boy, staring out of his bedroom window on Elizabeth Street. And even if you're not a big enough film nerd to make that connection, I really feel like Hugo's journey is not in finding a new father figure, but in persisting with the mechanical magic that stands as his own father's legacy. That's what film is: The persistence of vision that allows us to accept an illusory version of the world at 24 frames per second is science and magic at once. Hugo's relationship with Méliès isn't about him cozying up to a new daddy, but sharing a common enthusiasm the old man has submerged in bitterness. To me, that's a far more unique angle on a potentially shopworn premise.<br/><br/>Did you really find none of Hugo enchanting? Even the film's few detractors seem willing to admit that the sequences evoking cinema history and Méliès' studio—with Michael Stuhlbarg as the heroic film scholar!—were terrific. It felt, in the best possible way, like a heady compression of my History Of Film 101 class in college, condensing a semester's worth of clips and context into something between a montage and an animated pop-up book. And it speaks to the ingenious design of the film, which layers fact and fantasy so beautifully that it's at once a history of Méliès and the birth of cinema, and just the sort of simple, sumptuously produced cinematic wonder that Scorsese himself would have loved as a child. Thank goodness Hugo doesn't follow the Jeunet/Luhrmann model and have "a sense of its own ridiculousness." As a fantasy connoisseur yourself, wouldn't you say there's value in playing it straight and earnest and unabashed rather than winking at the audience? You may find Hugo sickly sweet, but I don't think the authenticity of its sentiment is to be denied.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Yes, I did in fact find parts of Hugo enchanting. (Notice how I'm answering your question up front, whereas you were too busy frothing with apoplexy to address mine, though I assume that's an answer in its own right. Okay, "influence" may be overstating the case—I just meant the visual style looked very familiar. Though as Keith pointed out when you brought this up in person, Scorsese is neither opposed to drawing inspiration from other people's visuals, nor immune to it.) Primarily, I was enchanted by the parts dealing with Georges Méliès' backstory, with his love of cinema, with the work he put into his art and the joy he got out of it. There's an awful lot of beauty and fun in the staging of the underwater-court scene from Méliès' "Fairyland," and in the sequence at the end, focusing on Méliès footage. I'll grant you that Hugo's connection with Méliès over a shared love of film is a nice touch. And I do enjoy a good film about filmmaking.<br/><br/>But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins. In addition to the themes you cite, it's also about finding your purpose, as the characters expressly, laboriously explain to each other and to us. And it's about spectacle, and big action setpieces, and chases, and happily-ever-after endings where even the angry bully and the shy older couple and fergawdsakes even the cranky dachshund all get paired off with charming love interests by the end. It's about the super-precocious Hermione Granger-type being bossy and perky and clever and praising the magical worlds encased in books. And all of this business is mighty familiar, and mighty artificial.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Yes, Scorsese is playing with archetypes. Problem is, I never felt he imbued them with anything new, fresh, or believable, in spite of his own backstory. I would have much preferred a story about a young Scorsese growing up with asthma—something small-scale and real, without vast rooms full of CGI clockwork and golden glowing dust-motes and prophetic dreams and a raging adult tyrant-guard with a heart of gold—all of that outsized, over-the-top nonsense. You keep citing Scorsese's personal background and love of film as evidence that he's really feeling what he's putting on the screen, but I don't feel his personal touch in any of this, except the moments that are expressly about film. The core emotions may be real, but that doesn't make the execution less false.<br/><br/>You say the authenticity of the emotion isn't to be denied. I don't question whether Scorsese personally felt lonely and isolated as a child, but I don't feel loneliness and isolation on the screen—I see a bunch of exaggerated signifiers (Hugo is filthy and his clothes are worn and all the adults yell at him and he regularly gets chased by a scary dog!) and big beats, with shouting and weeping and Spielbergian wonder-emoting. For me, sincerity is more convincing and more personal when it's quiet and direct; when someone's shouting his opinions at me, I assume he's either really angry, or just trying to overwhelm my senses to keep me from expressing my own opinion. Hugo was one long shout, as far as I was concerned.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Why didn't I get that sense of fakery from Amélie, you ask? Actually, I did. I'll completely acknowledge that Amélie and Moulin Rouge are both big, manipulative, artificial constructions in the exact same vein, demanding specific emotions at specific intervals, and trying to sell those emotions with heavy emoting and aggressive soundtrack prodding. Neither of them really sold me on their emotions as authentic human feeling. What I enjoyed in those two films was the construction—particularly Amélie's heady, laughable lists of random characterizing features and experiences for its cast, and Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups and recontextualizations. I'm often sold on stories that do creative or ambitious things with structure, and both of those movies qualify, where Hugo is a much more linear, standard kid-quest.<br/><br/>But in the end, for me, it really does come down to a feeling that those movies are goofs, whereas Hugo is meant to be taken seriously at every treacly moment. You don't think that's true—but you're simultaneously defending its integrity in terms of its absolutely authentic, rooted-in-Scorsese's-history emotion, and telling me I'm wrong, and he doesn't mean it to be taken seriously. How do you reconcile those two statements? What about the film suggests to you that it isn't meant to be taken at face value? And is it possible this is just another Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-like situation where I find the use of kids in big-budget films to be largely sappy and melodramatic, whereas you as a dad find it bypasses your cynicism and goes straight to your family-feeling?<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Scott: Not sure I meant that Scorsese doesn't mean to be taken seriously; it's just that he's chosen a whimsical vehicle through which to express a serious love of the movies. When you say, "But Hugo isn't primarily about film, in spite of the Méliès tie-ins," I'm mystified. I grant that you find many elements of Hugo overly familiar and laborious and full of Spielbergian wonder-emoting—there's nothing I can do to argue around that perception, which other Hugo doubters share. Sometimes a film means to charm and enchant, and it doesn't for some; you've got Hugo and I've got Amélie, though I think the latter, deliberately artificial as it is, means for us to find it romantic. (Rather than, say, some horrible mechanical contraption fit for a Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>But to say Hugo isn't primarily about film? If it's not about film, then it's the most pointlessly discursive story about [whatever you think it's about] I've ever seen. The relationship between Hugo and Méliès is the heart of the movie, and at the heart of that is not just some stock connection between Plucky Orphan and Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, but a shared affinity for engineered magic—specifically the magic of the movies. I think Scorsese and his collaborators have found a way to express their enthusiasm over the early days of cinema through a fantasy that's accessible to all ages. The archetype-filled children's tale is the merely the crust here; cinema is the pie. (Mmmm… pie.)<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>As for The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, I don't see much of a connection, other than trying to expose me as a Benjamin Button defender as a way of damaging my credibility. (Incidentally, how are the extras on that G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) I've said to you that the sleep-deprived new dad in me was perhaps vulnerable to Benjamin Button, but I can't imagine a time when the premise of aging in reverse wouldn't move me. (Cradling the love of your life in your arms as an infant? How can you not be affected by that?) And besides, I don't see how Benjamin Button relates much to Hugo as a film concerning kids, since that's just a small segment of a story that spans a much larger trajectory.<br/><br/>So have I convinced you? Likely not. But I'm happy to learn that Hugo wasn't entirely devoid of enchantments for you. The sequences on Méliès the filmmaker are what put Hugo over for me—and in that, at least, we can share some movie love.<br/><br/>Advertisement<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, I can't say you've convinced me, any more than I've convinced you. It's impossible to argue anyone into a visceral love of anything, and it really should be equally impossible to talk someone down from visceral love. Mostly, you've let me see Hugo in Scott-O-Vision, which is an interesting experience; at least now I'm mildly convinced that we didn't somehow manage to see entirely different films which both somehow had the same name and director.<br/><br/>We certainly had different experiences, though, and to my mind, focused on different aspects of the production: I still don't see the "film is marvelous" theme as the movie's single strand, so much as one among too many. "Pointlessly discursive" almost covers it, though I'd throw in "often needlessly cutesy and precious" on top of that. While you're focused on the film's tasty pie filling, I feel like that pie was covered with a pound of crystallized sugar, and I think that does make a difference, regardless of the film's core message or handful of terrific scenes. See also Benjamin Button, which I did not bring up just to chafe you—I really do think you have more of a sentimental streak than I do regarding children in cinema, especially when they're used more as symbols of vulnerability and innocence than as human characters. Hey, you know what film totally does not have cute wide-eyed moppets bringing hope to a cynical world? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Maybe I will go watch those Blu-ray extras. I could use some explosion-insulin to compensate for Hugo's sweetness. | Hoewel het erkennen dat het onmogelijk is om iemand te betwisten om van iets te houden dat ze haten, en vice versa, is het nog steeds vaak leuk om het argument te proberen.

Want het maakt niet uit wat de radio zegt, er is nog steeds een middenweg tussen "We zijn het volledig eens" en "Ik heb gelijk, en je bent dom en slecht."<br/><br/>Scott: Sinds het bespreken van mijn Scott Pilgrim vs. The World afvalligheid, hebben we gezocht naar een geval waar ik je kan oproepen omdat je niet van iets geweldigs houdt, en we hoefden niet lang te kijken. We zaten naast elkaar tijdens Martin Scorsese's Hugo - mij, volkomen betoverd door zijn fantastische eerbetoon aan de wonderen van de vroege stille cinema, en jij, blijkbaar het bij elke beurt weerstaan. Kritische consensus is aan mijn kant geweest: het raakte de nummer 9 plaats op onze collectieve Top 15 (hoewel je het vermeld als je Overrated keuze), heeft gewonnen (of geplaatst) in verschillende film-kritische awards, en geniet momenteel een score van 83 op Metacritic. Dat betekent natuurlijk niet dat je het mis hebt, maar het is aan jou om uit te leggen waarom Hugo, in jouw woorden, "hol en kunstmatig" was, waar velen van ons het zagen als een mooie evocatie van Scorsese's kindertijd en het medium toen het nog in zijn kinderschoenen stond. En wees alsjeblieft zacht als je deze vlinder uit elkaar scheurt bij de vleugels.<br/><br/>Advertentie<br/><br/>Tasha: Ik kan niet zachtaardig zijn, Scott. Soms doet het minder pijn als je de Band-Aid in één keer afscheurt. (En zelfs als dat niet zo is, wie wil er dan rondlopen met een half afgescheurde Band-Aid? Gross.) Feit is, ik vond Hugo een vermoeiend manipulatieve oefening in vervalsing, te beginnen vanaf de opening glijden door een Parijs treinstation, die me meer dan wat dan ook deed denken aan Robert Zemeckis 'The Polar Express. In tegenstelling tot Mike D'Angelo ben ik een fan van lang, ononderbroken neemt als een manier om een ruimte te vestigen en kijkers aan te moedigen om onbewust hun adem in te houden als een camera een gebied verkent; maar wanneer de ruimte wordt verkend, is een gladde, glanzende CGI-creatie, en de camera zweeft er gewichtloos doorheen zonder fysiek gevoel dat de camera of de omgeving anders een videogame begint te spelen. En de rest van de film voelde voor mij op dezelfde manier poreloos en onwerkelijk, zowel in termen van de setting als in termen van het hoogst bedachte, maudlin-verhaal.<br/><br/>Ik heb niet noodzakelijkerwijs een probleem met gefabriceerde, gestileerde omgevingen in film. Ik hield bijvoorbeeld van Baz Luhrmanns even wijdverspreide, volkomen kunstmatige kijk op Parijs in Moulin Rouge, maar die film heeft een gevoel van zijn eigen belachelijkheid, een gevoel van humor over hoe bewust over-the-top het is. Wat betreft de stylisatie van Jean-Pierre Jeunet, vooral in Amélie. (beide Jeunet en Luhrmann voelden zich hier als sterke visuele invloeden.) Ik kreeg echter het gevoel dat Martin Scorsese wilde dat ik Hugo helemaal serieus nam. Ook al is het weer een hartverscheurend sentimenteel verhaal over een pluizige wees die kleur terugbrengt in het leven van een gruwelijke oude kruimeldief, en dat kon ik gewoon niet.<br/><br/>Advertentie<br/><br/>Er is niets waar ik meer van geniet in film dan verrast te zijn. En er is niets waar ik meer tegen ben en weerstand bied dan openlijk gemanipuleerd te worden, hardop verteld te worden wat ik moet voelen en wanneer ik het moet voelen. Een goede film doet dit soort dingen op subtiele wijze; een slechte gebruikt crashende muziekaanwijzingen en zoete snaren - en in dit geval een grubby, reusachtig, onechte wees die treurig naar de camera staart - om pathos te eisen en om kijkers te vertellen dat ze vreselijke mensen zijn als ze het niet op aanvraag serveren. Dat gezegd hebbende, kan ik te maken krijgen met verdrietige kinderen en knorrige volwassenen die het leven voor elkaar beter maken - ik heb echt Le Havre van dit jaar gegraven, die in wezen hetzelfde plot was zonder al de schattigheid - maar ik vind dat de kunstmatige omgevingen slecht reflecteren op de kunstmatige emoties, en elk maakt de andere meer nep lijken per beurt.<br/><br/>Laten we beginnen met dat. In onze over het hoofd geziene filmvideo, namen jij en Noel Keith allebei de taak om Tyrannosaurus te verdedigen, omdat je vond dat het niet realistisch genoeg was - te bedacht, te miserabel, te veel, te ver. Hoe is het mogelijk dat je niet een gestimuleerde oude kruk kunt kopen die dingen breekt als hij boos is, maar je kunt een wees kopen die in een gigantische treinstationklok woont en op een grillige reis gaat om een mysterieuze automaton te repareren waarvan hij denkt dat hij geheimen kan dragen van zijn dode vader, maar die hem in plaats daarvan leidt op een eigenzinnige reis van zelfontdekking, naar het magische land? Heb je Hugo's gaudy rococo ontwerp, agressieve hartentrekkende plukken, of kruiwagen-loads van eigenzinnige zelfs een beetje overdreven of moeilijk te slikken gevonden?<br/><br/>Advertentie<br/><br/>Scott: Jeunet en Luhrmann als invloeden op Scorsese?! Vergeet om onfatsoenlijk te zijn, nu steek je me opzettelijk met een scherpe stok. Als je op zoek bent naar inspiratie voor Hugo - ja, als je op zoek bent naar de emotionele kern van Hugo - moet je teruggaan naar Scorsese's jeugd op Elizabeth Street in Little Italy, waar een astmatische kleine jongen, niet in staat om buiten te spelen met de andere kinderen, zich terugtrok naar Alexander Korda-fantasieën zoals The Thief Of Bagdad. Of, eenvoudiger gezegd, ga gewoon rechtstreeks naar de bron zelf: George Méliès, wiens A Trip To The Moon de oerknal van alle cinematografische fantasieën blijft, dat moment waarop de camera niet werd gebruikt om de wereld te documenteren zoals ze is, maar welke grillige, magische, transporterende plek een filmmaker er voor wil uitvinden. En die traditie is al tientallen jaren ontwikkeld en uitgebreid, voordat de mensen van Jeunet en Luhrmann er hun grubby kleine poten op kregen.<br/><br/>En over Jeunet gesproken, een mooie poging om mijn retorische wapen weg te nemen, maar ik zal het toch zeggen: hoe kun je van Amélie houden, maar toch Hugo synthetisch en "overmatig" en "vermoeiend manipulatief" vinden? Je zegt dat Amélie en Moulin Rouge "gevoel van hun eigen belachelijkheid" hebben verlost, waarbij Scorsese betekent dat we Hugo serieus nemen, en ik denk niet dat dat het geval is, althans op het laatste punt. Dat Scorsese duidelijk gepassioneerd is over de films is, denk ik, waarom je Hugo zou interpreteren als serieus, maar voor mij zijn het die gevoelens die de film een emotionele ballast geven die de Luhrmann- en Jeunet-films niet hebben. Alle drie de films maken agressief gebruik van de wonderen van CGI - en Scorsese voegt 3D toe aan de mix, met een prachtig effect - maar waar jij en ik verschillen, is het probleem van gewichtloosheid. Ik ben het ermee eens dat CGI een afstandseffect heeft; werelden die volledig bestaan uit digitale plasticine zijn flexibel tot het punt waar ze soms niet aanwezig zijn. Je verwees naar Hugo in je "Overrated" -vermelding voor ons Best Of Film stuk als "een CGI gimcrack" - een perfecte dis... voor een andere film.<br/><br/>Advertentie<br/><br/>Het is eerlijk om te zeggen dat Scorsese Hugo heeft gebouwd rond een standaard-issue, "hartstring-plucking" kinderboek / film plot: Orphan mist zijn vader, creëert zijn eigen kleine fantasiewereld, gloms op een nieuwe vriend, overtuigt een knappe oude fuddy-duddy om te verzachten en misschien adopteren hem. Maar dat is alleen het verhalende skelet, en Scorsese levert veel vlees en bloed. Ten eerste kun je niet kijken naar Hugo, de eenzame jongen, die uitkijkt van de klokkentorens naar de drukte van een treinstation in Parijs zonder te denken aan Scorsese, een andere eenzame jongen, die uit zijn slaapkamerraam op Elizabeth Street staart. En zelfs als je niet groot genoeg bent om die verbinding te maken, heb ik echt het gevoel dat Hugo's reis niet in het vinden van een nieuw vaderfiguur zit, maar in het volharden met de mechanische magie die staat als de erfenis van zijn eigen vader. De volharding van visie die ons in staat stelt om een illusoire versie van de wereld te accepteren met 24 frames per seconde is wetenschap en magie tegelijk. Hugo's relatie met Méliès gaat niet over hem knuffelen tot een nieuwe vader, maar het delen van een gemeenschappelijk enthousiasme dat de oude man heeft ondergedompeld in bitterheid. Voor mij is dat een veel uniekere hoek op een potentieel winkelgedragen uitgangspunt.<br/><br/>Zelfs de weinige critici van de film lijken bereid toe te geven dat de sequenties die de filmgeschiedenis en de studio van Méliès oproepen - met Michael Stuhlbarg als de heldhaftige filmgeleerde! - geweldig waren. Het voelde, op de best mogelijke manier, als een heady compressie van mijn History Of Film 101-klasse op de universiteit, die de waarde van clips en context van een semester samenvoegde tot iets tussen een montage en een geanimeerd pop-upboek. En het spreekt tot het ingenieuze ontwerp van de film, die feit en fantasie zo mooi lagen dat het tegelijk een verhaal is van Méliès en de geboorte van de cinema, en gewoon het soort eenvoudig, weelderig geproduceerd cinematisch wonder dat Scorsese zelf als kind zou hebben geliefd. Godzijdank volgt Hugo niet het Jeunet/Luhrmann-model en heeft "een gevoel van zijn eigen belachelijkheid". Als een fantasiekenner zelf, zou je niet zeggen dat er waarde is om het recht en serieus en onbeschaamd te spelen in plaats van naar het publiek te knipogen? U vindt Hugo misschien ziekelijk lief, maar ik denk niet dat de authenticiteit van zijn gevoel ontkend moet worden.<br/><br/>Advertentie<br/><br/>Tasha: Ja, ik vond eigenlijk delen van Hugo betoverend. (Let op hoe ik je vraag van tevoren beantwoord, terwijl je te druk bezig was met beroerte om de mijne aan te pakken, hoewel ik aanneem dat dat een antwoord op zich is. Oké, "invloed" kan de zaak overdrijven - ik bedoelde gewoon dat de visuele stijl er erg bekend uitzag. Hoewel, zoals Keith opmerkte toen je dit persoonlijk naar voren bracht, is Scorsese niet gekant tegen het trekken van inspiratie uit de beelden van andere mensen, noch immuun daarvoor.) In de eerste plaats was ik betoverd door de delen die te maken hebben met het achtergrondverhaal van Georges Méliès, met zijn liefde voor film, met het werk dat hij in zijn kunst stopte en de vreugde die hij eruit haalde. Er is een verschrikkelijke hoeveelheid schoonheid en plezier in de scène van de onderwater-court scène uit Méliès' "Fairyland," en in de volgorde aan het einde, gericht op Méliès beelden. Ik geef je toe dat Hugo's connectie met Méliès over een gedeelde liefde voor film een leuke touch is. En ik geniet van een goede film over filmmaken.<br/><br/>Maar ondanks de Méliès tie-ins gaat Hugo niet in de eerste plaats over film. Naast de thema's die je aanhaalt, gaat het ook over het vinden van je doel, zoals de personages nadrukkelijk, moeizaam aan elkaar en aan ons uitleggen. En het gaat over spektakel, en grote actie-setpieces, en achtervolgingen, en gelukkig-eeuwige eindes waar zelfs de boze pestkop en het verlegen oudere paar en fergawdsakes zelfs de gekke teckel allemaal worden gekoppeld aan charmante liefdesbelangen aan het einde. Het gaat over de super-precocious Hermione Granger-type zijn bazig en perky en slim en het prijzen van de magische werelden omhuld in boeken. En al deze zaken zijn machtig vertrouwd, en machtig kunstmatig.<br/><br/>Advertentie<br/><br/>Ja, Scorsese speelt met archetypes. Probleem is, ik heb nooit het gevoel dat hij ze heeft doordrenkt met iets nieuws, fris of geloofwaardig, ondanks zijn eigen backstory. Ik had veel liever een verhaal gehad over een jonge Scorsese die opgroeide met astma - iets kleinschalig en echt, zonder enorme kamers vol CGI-klokwerk en gouden gloeiende stofwoorden en profetische dromen en een woedende volwassen tirannieke bewaker met een hart van goud - al die oversized, over-the-top onzin. Je blijft Scorsese' persoonlijke achtergrond en liefde voor film citeren als bewijs dat hij echt voelt wat hij op het scherm zet, maar ik voel zijn persoonlijke aanraking hierin niet, behalve de momenten die expliciet over film gaan. De kern emoties kunnen echt zijn, maar dat maakt de executie niet minder vals.<br/><br/>Je zegt dat de authenticiteit van de emotie niet te ontkennen is. Ik vraag me niet af of Scorsese zich als kind persoonlijk eenzaam en geïsoleerd voelde, maar ik voel geen eenzaamheid en isolatie op het scherm - ik zie een stel overdreven signifiers (Hugo is smerig en zijn kleren worden gedragen en alle volwassenen schreeuwen naar hem en hij wordt regelmatig achtervolgd door een angstaanjagende hond!) en grote beats, met schreeuwen en verwondering. Oprechtheid is voor mij overtuigender en persoonlijker als het stil en direct is; als iemand zijn mening naar me schreeuwt, neem ik aan dat hij ofwel echt boos is, of gewoon probeert mijn zintuigen te overweldigen om me ervan te weerhouden mijn eigen mening te uiten. Hugo was een lange schreeuw, wat mij betreft.<br/><br/>Advertentie<br/><br/>Waarom heb ik niet dat gevoel van vervalsing van Amélie, vraag je? Ik zal volledig erkennen dat Amélie en Moulin Rouge beide grote, manipulatieve, kunstmatige constructies zijn in exact dezelfde ader, die specifieke emoties met specifieke tussenpozen eisen en proberen die emoties te verkopen met zware emotie en agressieve soundtrackprodding. Geen van hen verkocht me echt op hun emoties als authentiek menselijk gevoel. Wat ik leuk vond in die twee films was de constructie - vooral Amélie's heady, lachwekkende lijsten van willekeurige karakteristieke kenmerken en ervaringen voor haar cast, en Moulin Rouge's musical-magpie mashups en recontextualisaties. Ik word vaak verkocht op verhalen die creatieve of ambitieuze dingen doen met structuur, en beide films komen in aanmerking, waar Hugo een veel lineairere, standaard kinderquest is.<br/><br/>Maar uiteindelijk, voor mij, komt het echt neer op een gevoel dat die films zijn goofs, terwijl Hugo is bedoeld om serieus genomen te worden op elk treurig moment. Je denkt niet dat dat waar is - maar je verdedigt tegelijkertijd zijn integriteit in termen van zijn absoluut authentieke, gewortelde emotie in de geschiedenis van Scorsese, en vertelt me dat ik het mis heb, en hij betekent niet dat het serieus moet worden genomen. Hoe verzoen je die twee uitspraken? Hoe zit het met de film die je suggereert dat het niet bedoeld is om tegen reële waarde te worden genomen? En is het mogelijk dat dit gewoon een andere Curious Case Of Benjamin Button-achtige situatie is waar ik het gebruik van kinderen in big-budget films vind om grotendeels sappig en melodramatisch te zijn, terwijl je als vader vindt dat het je cynisme omzeilt en direct naar je familiegevoel gaat?<br/><br/>Advertentie<br/><br/>Scott: Niet zeker dat ik bedoelde dat Scorsese niet serieus genomen wil worden; het is gewoon dat hij een grillig voertuig heeft gekozen om een serieuze liefde voor de films uit te drukken. Als je zegt: "Maar Hugo gaat niet in de eerste plaats over film, ondanks de Méliès tie-ins," dan ben ik gemystificeerd. Ik geef toe dat je veel elementen van Hugo te vertrouwd en moeizaam en vol Spielbergiaanse wonderen vindt - er is niets wat ik kan doen om die perceptie te betwisten, die andere Hugo-twijfelaars delen. Soms betekent een film charme en betovering, en voor sommigen niet; je hebt Hugo en ik hebben Amélie, hoewel ik denk dat de laatste, opzettelijk kunstmatig zoals het is, betekent voor ons om het romantisch te vinden. (In plaats van, zeg, een aantal verschrikkelijke mechanische contraptie geschikt voor een Saw sequel.)<br/><br/>Maar om te zeggen dat Hugo niet in de eerste plaats over film gaat? Als het niet over film gaat, dan is het het meest zinloze discoursieve verhaal over [waarover je denkt dat het gaat] dat ik ooit heb gezien. De relatie tussen Hugo en Méliès is het hart van de film, en in het hart van dat is niet alleen een aantal voorraadverbinding tussen Plucky Orphan en Crusty Old Guy With A Heart Of Gold, maar een gedeelde affiniteit voor gemanipuleerde magie - in het bijzonder de magie van de films. Ik denk dat Scorsese en zijn medewerkers een manier hebben gevonden om hun enthousiasme over de vroege dagen van de film uit te drukken door middel van een fantasie die toegankelijk is voor alle leeftijden. Het met archetypes gevulde kinderverhaal is hier slechts de korst; cinema is de taart. (Mmmm... pie.)<br/><br/>Advertentie<br/><br/>Wat betreft The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button, zie ik niet veel van een verband, behalve dat ik me probeer te ontmaskeren als verdediger van Benjamin Button als een manier om mijn geloofwaardigheid te beschadigen. (Overigens, hoe zijn de extra's op die G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra Blu-ray?) Ik heb je gezegd dat de slaapberoofde nieuwe vader in mij misschien kwetsbaar was voor Benjamin Button, maar ik kan me geen tijd voorstellen waarin het uitgangspunt van het omgekeerde verouderen me niet zou bewegen. En trouwens, ik zie niet hoe Benjamin Button veel te maken heeft met Hugo als een film over kinderen, want dat is maar een klein stukje van een verhaal dat een veel groter traject overspant.<br/><br/>Dus heb ik je overtuigd? Waarschijnlijk niet. Maar ik ben blij om te horen dat Hugo niet helemaal verstoken was van betoveringen voor jou. De sequenties op Méliès de filmmaker zijn wat Hugo voor mij heeft overgebracht - en daarin kunnen we tenminste wat filmliefde delen.<br/><br/>Advertentie<br/><br/>Tasha: Nope, ik kan niet zeggen dat je me hebt overtuigd, meer dan ik je heb overtuigd. Het is onmogelijk om iemand te betwisten in een viscerale liefde van iets, en het zou echt net zo onmogelijk moeten zijn om iemand neer te praten vanuit viscerale liefde. Meestal heb je me Hugo in Scott-O-Vision laten zien, wat een interessante ervaring is; nu ben ik er in ieder geval mild van overtuigd dat we er op de een of andere manier niet in geslaagd zijn om volledig verschillende films te zien die beide op de een of andere manier dezelfde naam en regisseur hadden.<br/><br/>We hadden zeker verschillende ervaringen, maar, en naar mijn mening, gericht op verschillende aspecten van de productie: ik zie nog steeds niet de "film is geweldig" thema als de enige streng van de film, zo veel als een van te veel. "Onzinloos discoursief" bedekt het bijna, hoewel ik er "vaak onnodig schattig en kostbaar" bovenop zou gooien. Terwijl je je concentreert op de lekkere taartvulling van de film, heb ik het gevoel dat die taart bedekt was met een pond gekristalliseerde suiker, en ik denk dat dat een verschil maakt, ongeacht de kernboodschap van de film of een handvol geweldige scènes. Zie ook Benjamin Button, die ik niet alleen heb opgevoed om je te schelden - ik denk echt dat je meer van een sentimentele streep hebt dan ik met betrekking tot kinderen in de bioscoop, vooral als ze meer worden gebruikt als symbolen van kwetsbaarheid en onschuld dan als menselijke personages. Hé, weet je welke film helemaal geen schattige wijde ogen heeft die hoop brengen in een cynische wereld? G.I. Joe: The Rise Of Cobra. Misschien ga ik die Blu-ray-extra's bekijken. Ik kan wat explosie-insuline gebruiken om Hugo's zoetheid te compenseren. |
| "I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times": Mee Mee's story as a refugee Mom<br/><br/>Hope in Times of Crisis: A Mother's Day Story<br/><br/>By Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee heard that the soldiers were coming. She took hold of her son and frantically joined the rest of the villagers who were running toward the Thai-Burmese border, where the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) was located. Her husband was in another village running in the opposite direction, Mee later learned. After the soldiers' pursuit ended, Mee returned home to her small village in Koechi, Burma.<br/><br/>During 1997-2000, Mee and thousands like her lived under the constant threat of violence from Burmese soldiers. Many people would take temporary refuge in the jungle, and return home to their village after soldiers left the area, just to do it all over again days later. About once a week, Mee and others would be on the move to avoid capture, rape, or death by soldiers.<br/><br/>During one incident, Mee's husband ran ahead of his wife to secure food for his family. Her husband was spotted by soldiers and shot. The bullet shattered a portion of his ribcage, leaving him severely wounded and in distress as he journeyed toward the jungle with his family for safety.<br/><br/>For three months, Mee's husband hid and moved the family with an exasperating wound at his side. He received no medical care, except for Mee's tending.<br/><br/>"I was afraid to return to Burma," Mee said through an interpreter. "I feared dying. I cried and cried every day," she continued.<br/><br/>Mee's husband eventually drew enough strength to walk five days toward a small village in Thailand where they learned the location of a hospital and a refugee camp. When Mee and her husband finally arrived at the hospital, he underwent immediate surgery and later recovered.<br/><br/>Symbol of Hope<br/><br/>Life in the jungle for those fleeing Burmese soldiers was indeed terrifying and difficult. Makeshift bamboo tents with only roof and floor coverings became suitable temporary dwellings. Many women including Mee gave birth to children in the jungle. Mee's then six-year-old son assisted in the delivery of his sister named Eh Ku Hser. Her name means love – cold – sweet. "Cold" in Burmese culture means so as to not pass through the fire of life, as heat represents troubled times.<br/><br/>"I hoped my daughter would be free from difficult and troubling times," said Mee. "I did not want her to go through what I had experienced," she continued.<br/><br/>For Mee, the birth of her daughter in the midst of darkness, torment and fear, was a symbol of hope for a new life to come. Hope in times of crisis, the very premise of the United Methodist Committee on Relief's (UMCOR) newly co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is also the essence of that which candles shed light upon.<br/><br/>A New Beginning<br/><br/>With the help of UNHCR, hope for a new life did indeed materialize for Mee and her family when they resettled in West Springfield, Massachusetts. There, Mee met Moo Kho Paw, another woman who emigrated from Burma, and who was working at Prosperity Candle in Florence. The organization helps refugee women who have escaped areas of conflict rebuild their lives through the art of candle making. Moo Kho recommended that Mee join the organization, and Mee gladly accepted.<br/><br/>"I was excited to be out of the house," said Mee, "I was raised to believe that because I was a woman, my role was to remain at home and raise my family," she continued. "While many Burmese women want to do more for themselves, they are often encouraged to remain homemakers."<br/><br/>Today, Mee has plans to go into the candle-making business for herself and support her five children, but she expressed the need to learn English first.<br/><br/>"In the Thai refugee camp, we had education, but it was not so good," said Mee. "When I was a child, I wanted to go to school, but I was told to stay home because I was a woman. Now, I have hopes for my daughters to go to college and become doctors or policewomen," continued Mee.<br/><br/>Mee has struck an even balance in her life that she wishes others would have found—a simple, happy life where work, caring for family members and freedom of choice all have their place.<br/><br/>Support Refugee Women in the US<br/><br/>Share this Mother's Day story with your loved ones. And, when you purchase handmade candles by Mee, Moo Kho, and Naw, another Burmese refugee woman working at Prosperity Candle , know you are helping to support their livelihood as they rebuild their lives and those of their family members in the US. | "Ik hoopte dat mijn dochter vrij zou zijn van moeilijke en verontrustende tijden": Mee Mee's verhaal als vluchteling Moeder<br/><br/>Hoop in tijden van crisis: een moederdagverhaal<br/><br/>Door Judith Santiago*<br/><br/>Mee Mee hoorde dat de soldaten kwamen. Ze greep haar zoon en sloot zich razendsnel aan bij de rest van de dorpelingen die naar de Thais-Burmese grens liepen, waar het kantoor van de Hoge Commissaris voor Vluchtelingen van de Verenigde Naties (UNHCR) was gevestigd. Haar man was in een ander dorp dat in de tegenovergestelde richting liep, vernam Mee later. Nadat de achtervolging van de soldaten was beëindigd, keerde Mee terug naar haar kleine dorp in Koechi, Birma.<br/><br/>In de periode 1997-2000 leefden Mee en duizenden van haar onder de constante dreiging van geweld door Birmese soldaten. Veel mensen namen tijdelijke toevlucht in de jungle en keerden terug naar hun dorp nadat soldaten het gebied hadden verlaten, om het dagen later opnieuw te doen. Ongeveer een keer per week zouden Mee en anderen in beweging zijn om gevangenneming, verkrachting of de dood door soldaten te voorkomen.<br/><br/>Tijdens een incident rende Mee's man voor zijn vrouw om voedsel voor zijn familie te krijgen. Haar man werd gespot door soldaten en neergeschoten. De kogel verbrijzelde een deel van zijn ribbenkast, waardoor hij ernstig gewond en in nood raakte terwijl hij met zijn familie naar de jungle reisde voor veiligheid.<br/><br/>Drie maanden lang verborg en verhuisde Mee's man de familie met een vervelende wond aan zijn zijde. Hij kreeg geen medische zorg, behalve voor Mee's zorg.<br/><br/>"Ik was bang om terug te keren naar Birma," zei Mee via een tolk. "Ik was bang om te sterven. Ik huilde en huilde elke dag," ging ze verder.<br/><br/>Mee's man trok uiteindelijk genoeg kracht om vijf dagen naar een klein dorp in Thailand te lopen, waar ze de locatie van een ziekenhuis en een vluchtelingenkamp leerden kennen. Toen Mee en haar man eindelijk in het ziekenhuis aankwamen, onderging hij onmiddellijk een operatie en herstelde hij later.<br/><br/>Symbool van hoop<br/><br/>Het leven in de jungle voor de vluchtende Birmese soldaten was inderdaad angstaanjagend en moeilijk. Makkelijke bamboetenten met alleen dak- en vloerbedekking werden geschikte tijdelijke woningen. Veel vrouwen, waaronder Mee, bevallen kinderen in de jungle. Mee's toen zesjarige zoon hielp bij de bevalling van zijn zus genaamd Eh Ku Hser. Haar naam betekent liefde - koud - zoet. "Koud" in de Birmese cultuur betekent om niet door het vuur van het leven te gaan, omdat warmte onrustige tijden vertegenwoordigt.<br/><br/>"Ik hoopte dat mijn dochter vrij zou zijn van moeilijke en verontrustende tijden," zei Mee. "Ik wilde niet dat ze door zou gaan wat ik had meegemaakt," ging ze verder.<br/><br/>Voor Mee was de geboorte van haar dochter te midden van duisternis, kwelling en angst een symbool van hoop voor een nieuw leven. Hoop in tijden van crisis, de premisse van de United Methodist Committee on Relief (UMCOR) nieuw co-branded UMCOR-Prosperity Candle, is ook de essentie van wat kaarsen licht werpen op.<br/><br/>Een nieuw begin<br/><br/>Met de hulp van UNHCR heeft de hoop op een nieuw leven inderdaad gerealiseerd voor Mee en haar familie toen ze zich in West Springfield, Massachusetts, vestigden. Daar ontmoette Mee Moo Kho Paw, een andere vrouw die uit Birma emigreerde, en die werkte bij Prosperity Candle in Florence. De organisatie helpt vluchtelingenvrouwen die uit conflictgebieden zijn ontsnapt, hun leven opnieuw op te bouwen door de kunst van het maken van kaarsen. Moo Kho raadde Mee aan om zich bij de organisatie aan te sluiten, en Mee aanvaardde het graag.<br/><br/>"Ik was opgewonden om uit het huis te zijn," zei Mee, "Ik werd opgevoed om te geloven dat omdat ik een vrouw was, mijn rol was om thuis te blijven en mijn gezin op te voeden," vervolgde ze. "Hoewel veel Birmese vrouwen meer voor zichzelf willen doen, worden ze vaak aangemoedigd om huisvrouwen te blijven."<br/><br/>Vandaag is Mee van plan om zelf kaarsen te maken en haar vijf kinderen te ondersteunen, maar ze heeft de behoefte uitgesproken om eerst Engels te leren.<br/><br/>"In het Thaise vluchtelingenkamp hadden we onderwijs, maar het was niet zo goed," zei Mee. "Toen ik een kind was, wilde ik naar school gaan, maar er werd me gezegd thuis te blijven omdat ik een vrouw was. Nu heb ik hoop dat mijn dochters naar de universiteit gaan en artsen of politievrouwen worden", vervolgde Mee.<br/><br/>Mee heeft een evenwicht gevonden in haar leven dat ze wenst dat anderen zouden hebben gevonden - een eenvoudig, gelukkig leven waar werk, zorg voor familieleden en keuzevrijheid allemaal hun plaats hebben.<br/><br/>Steun vluchtelingenvrouwen in de VS<br/><br/>Deel dit Moederdag verhaal met je dierbaren.

| The Precedency Essay<br/><br/>1562 words - 7 pages<br/><br/>Affirmative action is a government policy that gives opportunities to minorities, women, and any group who has been the victim of discrimination in the past. Affirmative action is the outcome of the 1960's Civil Rights movement, growing out of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 which outlawed discrimination based on race, ethnicity, or gender. It was the 1978 Supreme Court decision, The Regents of the University of California v. Bakke, which allowed for the use of race-based preferences as a means of fostering diversity, allowing affirmative action to be used in admissions policies. It was created with the intention to provide equal opportunities for members of minority groups in education and ...view middle of the document...<br/><br/>However, according to a 2007 report by the Pew Research Center, support for affirmative action among the American public has actually increased substantiallyin recent years, climbing from 58% in 1995 to 70% in 2007. Supporters of affirmative action make many arguments in support of affirmative action, in the hopes of getting others to see the genuine good that affirmative actin policies bring to our society. Supporters believe that affirmative action is more of a process rather than an admissions policy. Colleges and universities take the extra initiative to reach out to minority groups, encouraging them to apply. Colleges and universities offer additional financial aid and provide on-campus resources to help better the student's college education. Supporters also note the rising number of minority applications to colleges and universities due in part to affirmative action policies.<br/>Statistics have proven that when affirmative action is eliminated, such as when it was at Berkley College and UCLA in 1998, the minority student admissions fell 61 percent and 36 percent respectively, proving that affirmative action plays a major role in a minority students college admissions process. Affirmative action supporters also believe that diversity in higher education provides a better educational atmosphere for all students, personally and intellectually. If affirmative action were to be eliminated, there would be fewer minority students enrolled in colleges, causing diversity to be fairly slim. Affirmative action policies are also necessary in order to compensate for centuries of racial, economic, and social oppression. Individuals with a higher socioeconomic status have more opportunities than those of lower socioeconomic backgrounds. Supporters believe that certain racial or ethnic groups are disadvantaged because they are frequently in lower income households and consequently are not exposed to the same resources as students from higher socioeconomic classes. Advocates support the notion of competition between students based on merit, but argue that affirmative action compensates for economic differences. College graduates, who have benefitted from affirmative action, have also said that they received better jobs, earned more money, and overall live better lives because of the fortunate opportunities they received through affirmative action.<br/>Supporters of affirmative action continuously stress the severe importance of affirmative action, considering its contributions to enhancing both the college experience and society in general. However, opponents of affirmative action believe that the time has come to end affirmative action. Opponents believe affirmative action was created to ensure fair admission practices to bring change to a long period of racial discrimination. They believe the policy is outdated."It's time to pull the plug on race-based decision making," says Ward Connerly, a Sacramento, California businessman and lead organizer of...<br/><br/>Find Another Essay On The Precedency<br/><br/>754 words - 4 pages<br/>of the burden to continue prospering.

Hogescholen en universiteiten nemen het extra initiatief om minderheidsgroepen te bereiken en hen aan te moedigen om zich aan te melden. Hogescholen en universiteiten bieden extra financiële hulp en bieden op de campus middelen om te helpen beter de studenten van de universiteit onderwijs. Ondersteuners merken ook het toenemende aantal aanvragen van minderheden bij hogescholen en universiteiten op, deels als gevolg van affirmatief actiebeleid.<br/>Statistieken hebben aangetoond dat wanneer affirmatieve actie wordt geëlimineerd, zoals toen het aan het Berkley College en UCLA in 1998 was, de toelatingen van studenten in de minderheid met respectievelijk 61 procent en 36 procent daalden, wat bewijst dat affirmatieve actie een belangrijke rol speelt in een toelatingsproces voor studenten in de minderheid. Ondersteuners van affirmatieve actie geloven ook dat diversiteit in het hoger onderwijs een betere educatieve sfeer biedt voor alle studenten, persoonlijk en intellectueel. Als positieve actie zou worden geëlimineerd, zou er minder minderheidsstudenten ingeschreven in de hogescholen, waardoor diversiteit vrij slank. Bevestigend beleid is ook nodig om eeuwen van raciale, economische en sociale onderdrukking te compenseren. Individuen met een hogere sociaaleconomische status hebben meer kansen dan personen met een lagere sociaaleconomische achtergrond. Voorstanders zijn van mening dat bepaalde raciale of etnische groepen benadeeld zijn omdat ze vaak in huishoudens met een lager inkomen zijn en daarom niet worden blootgesteld aan dezelfde middelen als studenten van hogere socio-economische klassen. Advocaten steunen het idee van concurrentie tussen studenten op basis van verdienste, maar stellen dat affirmatieve actie economische verschillen compenseert. Afgestudeerden, die hebben geprofiteerd van affirmatieve actie, hebben ook gezegd dat ze betere banen hebben gekregen, meer geld hebben verdiend en over het algemeen een beter leven hebben vanwege de gelukkige kansen die ze hebben gekregen door affirmatieve actie.<br/>Ondersteuners van affirmatieve actie benadrukken voortdurend het ernstige belang van affirmatieve actie, gezien de bijdragen ervan aan het verbeteren van zowel de universiteitservaring als de samenleving in het algemeen. Tegenstanders van affirmatieve actie geloven echter dat de tijd is gekomen om een einde te maken aan affirmatieve actie. Tegenstanders geloven dat affirmatieve actie is gecreëerd om eerlijke toelatingspraktijken te garanderen om verandering te brengen in een lange periode van raciale discriminatie. Ze geloven dat het beleid verouderd is."

| Combinations<br/><br/>Combinations Are defenses against a punch, choreographed responses to different types of attacks. They have many names across the martial arts but (in my experience) every art has a version of them. This makes them different than forms because there are plenty of martial arts that have no forms. What makes there partner exercises so universal? Why practice a specific response when (in reality) timing, type of attack, size of the attacker, and a hundred other factors will make it so you never use that entire choreographed response? And finally, how can we practice for a real defense situation and avoid injury at the same time?<br/><br/>The universality of combinations is impressive, to say the least. Our style of Kenpo karate has a list of 108 combos that can be learned. (Most students only learn 20-30 though) In Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu you spend whole classes practicing arm bars and chokes, learning every subtlety to the move while your partner offers little to no resistance. Every boxer has spent hours in front of the bag and/or mirror throwing the same combination of punches until their body moves by reflex alone. Combinations are universal because we have no better way to introduce movement and then practice the subtle positions required to make them work. Hitting a small pressure point through clothing takes A LOT of practice, catching an arm bar with control requires a carefully placed hip and a sneaky setup, and a great combination is only useful if you can through it from a balanced and protected position. Can you think of a better way to gain these skills?<br/><br/>There is any number of factors that determine how you respond to an attack and whether in a sparring match or in a fight, I have NEVER used a full combination in my defense. Why, then, do we spend hours practicing them? We practice these choreographed responses because the objective is not to pull combination 8 out every time you see a hook punch but to show you one way of blocking it and then a possible way to follow it up. I have never chosen to use combination 3 in a reality situation but the block is one of my go-to moves. Combinations add tools to the toolbox they do not fix the car.<br/><br/>The last question is a question of safety. If we practice for the sake of reality we need to replicate reality. How do we prevent injury while doing so? When it comes down to it, it's about building trust. We start slow and learn to trust that we have control over ourselves. We learn to trust our partners have control as well. In more time we learn to trust our control over our partner and (a little scarier) we learn to trust our partner's control over us. In the end (with a lot of practice) you can move are full speed, tossing your partner, and being thrown without fear of injury.<br/><br/>Combinations are universal for a reason; they are practiced so they can be dissected into their parts, and we stay safe by starting slow and building trust. As with everything else in the martial arts, combinations have many reasons behind their practice and execution. | Combinaties<br/><br/>Combinaties zijn verdedigingen tegen een punch, gechoreografeerde reacties op verschillende soorten aanvallen. Ze hebben vele namen in de vechtsporten, maar (in mijn ervaring) elke kunst heeft een versie van hen. Dit maakt ze anders dan vormen omdat er veel vechtsporten zijn die geen vormen hebben. Wat maakt er partneroefeningen zo universeel? Waarom een specifieke reactie oefenen wanneer (in werkelijkheid) de timing, het type aanval, de grootte van de aanvaller en honderd andere factoren ervoor zorgen dat je nooit die hele gechoreografeerde reactie gebruikt? En tenslotte, hoe kunnen we oefenen voor een echte verdedigingssituatie en tegelijkertijd letsel voorkomen?<br/><br/>De universaliteit van combinaties is op zijn zachtst gezegd indrukwekkend. Onze stijl van Kenpo karate heeft een lijst van 108 combo’s die je kunt leren. (De meeste studenten leren slechts 20-30) In Braziliaanse Jiu-Jitsu besteed je hele klassen aan het oefenen van armbars en chokes, het leren van elke subtiliteit om te bewegen, terwijl je partner weinig tot geen weerstand biedt. Elke bokser heeft uren voor de tas en / of spiegel doorgebracht met dezelfde combinatie van stoten totdat hun lichaam alleen door reflex beweegt. Combinaties zijn universeel omdat we geen betere manier hebben om beweging te introduceren en vervolgens de subtiele posities te oefenen die nodig zijn om ze te laten werken. Het raken van een klein drukpunt door middel van kleding vergt veel oefening, het vangen van een armbar met controle vereist een zorgvuldig geplaatste heup en een sneaky setup, en een geweldige combinatie is alleen nuttig als je er doorheen kunt vanuit een uitgebalanceerde en beschermde positie. Kun je een betere manier bedenken om deze vaardigheden te verwerven?<br/><br/>Er zijn een aantal factoren die bepalen hoe je reageert op een aanval en of in een sparringwedstrijd of in een gevecht, ik heb NOOIT een volledige combinatie in mijn verdediging gebruikt. Waarom besteden we dan uren aan het oefenen ervan? We oefenen deze gechoreografeerde reacties omdat het doel niet is om elke keer dat je een haakpunch ziet combinatie 8 eruit te trekken, maar om je een manier te laten zien om het te blokkeren en vervolgens een mogelijke manier om het op te volgen. Ik heb er nooit voor gekozen om combinatie 3 in een realiteitssituatie te gebruiken, maar het blok is een van mijn go-to moves. Combinaties voegen gereedschap toe aan de gereedschapskist die de auto niet repareren.<br/><br/>De laatste vraag is een kwestie van veiligheid. Als we oefenen omwille van de realiteit, moeten we de realiteit repliceren. Hoe voorkomen we letsel terwijl we dat doen? Als het erop aankomt, gaat het om het opbouwen van vertrouwen. We beginnen langzaam en leren te vertrouwen dat we de controle over onszelf hebben. We leren te vertrouwen dat onze partners ook de controle hebben. In meer tijd leren we onze controle over onze partner te vertrouwen en (een beetje enger) leren we de controle van onze partner over ons te vertrouwen. Op het einde (met veel oefening) kun je op volle snelheid bewegen, je partner gooien en worden gegooid zonder angst voor blessures.<br/><br/>Combinaties zijn universeel voor een reden; ze worden beoefend zodat ze kunnen worden ontleden in hun onderdelen, en we blijven veilig door langzaam te beginnen en vertrouwen op te bouwen. Zoals met al het andere in de vechtsporten, hebben combinaties vele redenen achter hun beoefening en executie. |
